1. upgrade to 0.66.0 from 0.65.1
i am currently upgrading my project from storybook v3 to v4 (coupled with a webpack 3-->4 and babel 6-->7 upgrade).
since i initialized storybook like this: `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type angular ` i expect for the storysnapshot to run to completion, without error codes referencing storybook/react such as `cannot find module '@storybook/react ' from 'badge.stories.js '`
clean virtualenv with tensorflow==2.0.0 installed raises a sigbus when operating on large enough numpy arrays using tf_dataset = output_shapes=(none, 3)) with a function that generates and operates on medium sized numpy arrays triggers a sigbus signal.

by inferencing it from input vector(s) like so: phofcode i get error that tf.random.normal is not supported by tf lite runtime: > some of operators in model are not supported by standard tensorflow lite runtime.
basically i am working on a site that uses decoupled `vue` components built as libraries which communicate data through a global `vuex` store on the `window`, unfortunately this prevents `mapactions` working with storybook because context of `this.$store` is wrong.
i tried to pass my custom metric with two strategies: by passing a custom function `custom_accuracy` to the `tf.keras.model.compile` method, or by subclassing the `meanmetricwrapper` class and giving an instance of my subclass named `customaccuracy` to i also tried two different saving format available: h5 and tf.

same result, but taking less time.
the only way (in my experience so far) to force the css resources tab to display anything is to purposefully create an error in one of story files and then fix error.

* only channel names / users containing a `b` in their name should appear
if any were, i killed them off.
i wrote no code - node.js version: v10.16.0 - npm version: 6.9.0 - strapi version: 3.0.0-beta.7 - database: mongodb 4.0.10 operating system: windows 10 / 64bi
yet, it returns all the data from the database (i tested this with all kinds of filtering not only nested ones) - node.js version: v10.16.0 - npm version: 6.9.0 - strapi version: 3.0.0-beta.10 - database: postgress
same behavior as non ssr.
updating strapi from beta-15 to beta-16 leads to an error: phofcode
after upgrading to v1.14, training is slowed down, and the tpu profiler reports that much more of the step time is spent waiting for input (~67.1%).
the contexts plugin works fine for me in the browser, but when run through jest via the storyshots addon a syntax error is generated.
both apps and libraries contain components that i would like to use with storybook.

the cause is that instead of passing the id of the a-based entry, to passes value of "value" field of model a.
steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. try to log an action with a cycled argument (with circular references).
if including tracebacks, please include the full traceback.
installation of modheader extension in firefox through selenium (using below code) not working: phofcode however if i try to install through browser, i am able to install it successfully.
i am using a `tf.data.dataset` to train a `tf.keras` model.
just send options request to /api/v1/login
steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. go to a story in storybook 2. change properties using knobs 3. click on `open canvas in new tab` image phofimage 4. component loads in a new tab with default values
2- do driver.findelements for any locator which is not in current context.

the error should not be reproduced and the panel built.
color control doesn't work in firefox at all.
1. click `administration/custom sounds` 2. on right bar click on `+` sign and add a custom sound 3. add relevant info
an error is thrown because it expects stories to return a jsx.element, but without specifying that this should be a preact.jsx.element, it will resolve react.jsx.element (and there are some interface differences).
when removing the value from the "number" knob, following error appears in the console: <details> <summary>full log</summary> <pre> warning: `value` prop on `input` should not be null.
the exact line can be found here phofhyperlink .
if you never set it, then it will be 'channels_last '.
it may be that first idea already possible, thus if it is, i would like know
it shows `0 passes` and `0 violations` on any story regardless of decorator being set or not.

2. test configuration with "test connection" button.
i think have done all set up correctly (addons.js, package.json, etc).
revert to the old display where there wasnt a vertical scroll bar
using phofurl does not work for us, because there is a bug with the callback url.
i am trying to get strapi to pass facebook the correct callback url, but am unable to achieve this despite following the documentation.
if the model is trained with mirroredstrategy on two gpus an accuracy of 0 is reached after 150 epochs in 5h.
storybook 5.1 should behave a 5.0.x

1. open any image in firefox (66.0.3 for me).
my snapshots should not break, or at least should not render completely different output
6. the message will not be translated.
detailed steps to reproduce the behavior:
after upgrading storybook-react-native to ver 5.1.3-rc, there is a lack of padding / margin around the app.
i expect rocket.chat to remain buttery smooth.
have a clean `npm install`.
i expected strapi to return the attributes of the entry that i just deleted, but instead it only returns `null` values.
i'm using markdown-loader for webpack to handle this files.
_steps to reproduce the behavior:_ 1. cra and eject or use react-rewired 2. insure you have the newest versions of react/mobx/mobx-react dependencies 3. create some variables under mobx @observable, ensure that babel plugins in `package.json` has 4. run `npm run start` to see the variables working as defined pre installation of storybook 5. install storybook using cli and see that variables are undefined and the app fails to compile.

large logs and files should be attached.
steps to reproduce the behavior: a. create some file e.g.
possible solution is to improve error handling here: phofurl we can test for stats object (i don 't know whether is better to test for interface or add `instanceof` check): phofcode another possible solution is to rewrite promises in so that they always return `error` instances (but in this case i 've got problems with output formatting.

1. create model venue with field `name` 2. set `maintitle`, and entry title to `name` 3. create model edition with 'has a' relation to model venue 4. create records for models venue and edition, where model edition is related to venue 5. model is still referred to by its id, instead of `name` `metadatas` fetched in edition does not seem reflect the updated `mainfield` for venue.
the vm is on m2 ssd, so disk speed is not affecting this issue.
so for example a boolean is still true instead of false (default value).
i was thinking that we should do same, to avoid doing workaround on clients to map same model.

i 'm evaluating whether to move my team 's project from 3.0.0-beta.7 to 3.0.0-beta.16, and in my exploratory test migration, i 'm seeing potentially blocking behavior - wondering whether user error is at play here, expected behavior has changed, or there 's a bug.
either code or documentation needs to be fixed.
detailed steps to reproduce the behavior:
the only error logging i get is ` tensor specified in either feed_devices or fetch_devices was not found in the graph

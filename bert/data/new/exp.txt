the input box in a dialog should behave like all other textinputlayout in the app when setting textinputstyle on the theme the dialog should respect it image url this looks like 1707 1701 1695 1712 and i am using material version alpha08 but as mentioned this happens in version as well as used in sample app
the dialog shouldn t dismiss or is there any other flag to prevent autodismiss on outside dialog touch
i have a dialog with bottomsheet behavior i set a edittext to it using input when i show the dialog the soft keyboard immediately shows which moves the dialog to the top as keyboard is drawn below it i want to 1 prevent soft keyboard from automatically opening when dialog with input is shown 2 change drawing behavior so that keyboard is drawn on top of overlaying it rather than below it
the top should have the corner radius set to 16dp
it should popup the paste option
show the modifications after doing them for example show the new text image
when clicking the button instead of showing the sheet always it shows only the first time the other times screen darken itself but sheet never appears if i remove behavior everything works correctly but as a dialog
should behave just exactly like version version not losing its checked status after clicking it again
width of dialog grows to minimum width needed for datepicker view inside i
to see the correct default time
the color of the action buttons should be set per the md color button text but is instead colorprimary
dialog with message only set to appear as before
text gravity should be at end the issue is with the following code in dialogactionbutton java if stacked setgravityendcompat else gravity center the setgravityendcompat is only setting the textalignment and not gravity i think you should be setting textalignment to gravity and set to proper value because update method is called several time during flow and first with stacked false so is set to center thus making button text centered manually setting fixing issue kotlin val button getactionbutton whichbutton positive button post button end thanks
positive button not change when color is selecte
i expect that the value of the button text changes to what i set it to in ondismiss but that doesn t happen because it says the button is null
the negative option should have focus by default you shouldn t be able to lose focus by clicking up down or left on the dpad right on the dpad should move to the positive option
keep showing all 3 buttons as with previous versions
pages rendering and event speed should be as fast as render in sdk version version
may be permission denied
1 no flickering when clicking 2 no setting invalid class for first element in list in weex version it works well
may be so is not right
able to create or build
when i click the connect button the websocket should be connected
load the page normally and run js
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen

fiddler shows a request to url
i expected the import to work i found a stackoverflow question related to this here url following this i created src types axios d ts with the following contents declare module axios lib adapters http import adapter from axios const httpadapter adapter export default httpadapter and this seems to fix the issue but i consider it a workaround and it would be nice to have axios contain typescript type definitions for all the types it defines
custom config parameter passed or the ability to use another config option to pass custom data
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen the method specific headers should be merged in with the headers before setting content type if not set
the json response should be parsed and returned as typeof response data object or whatever the response was
test header is useful but content type is ignored
the geturi method always returns the full url of the request config
a way to support xdomainrequest or must lock the version
post request to work of course
the request should use the url property if present and absolute alternatively the documentation should reflect that baseurl is required to use instance request
throw an error with status code properly
according to the docs all configuration options are merged url instance methods i expected request to contain both q and page params this is also how it was working in version version which is how i noticed
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
shouldn t proxied
content type application json header should be set as default for object data without charset parameter
well before it was turned into jsx the axios post was working now it is not i was hoping it would continue working however barring that is there some type i have to set somewhere
if a socket stops writing for long period of time the request should timeout nodejs get requests can detect this you need to use their timeout event instead of just using a timer url http event timeout
i expected it to just tell me headers cant be strings or headers must be an object etc

the command to finish without exception as described here url upsert that updates a row conflict on primary key however i get exactly the exception which upsert should prevent
i expect the db to drop or at least there should be a force option to make it so
the test should execute in roughly the same amount of time regardless of the mechanism used for transaction retries however the execution times differ by an extremely large factor
the text array field should be scanned into the string slice
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
expected the database to restore properly without an error
the error that should be thrown is pq only users with the admin role are allowed to create database this may cause confusion since as a core user only the root user has the admin role and granting roles is an enterprise feature might be possible to throw a different error depending on whether an enterprise license in enabled
that the ddl statements would execute with no errors
i expected the quit subcommand to block until shutdown completes either optionally or by default
i expected the listening url file to be written out before control is returned to the shell if that s not possible it d be nice to clarify the cockroach start help output

mvcc values should not be saturating a system range to the point that a cluster freezes up
i would expect the last query to return only the foo bar row not both
there shouldn t a drastic change visible in the write throughput as experienced by the client
the workload ran fine with 100 warehouses the init phase of tppc with 1000 warehouses seemed to run without error cockroach should handle data distribution and not allow the cluster to get hosed
i expect this to return a result without crashing

a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen nothing the check constraints should be untouched
import should finish even if it takes a while but should just hang indefinitely without any progress if applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem
installation instructions or the manifest to function as a new user i went from step1 step2 straight to filing a github issue

pausing a job shouldn t succeed until all related processing is actually paused
i expect nodes that are unhealthy and that cannot receive replicas to show up as unhealthy in some way in the cluster status page
imports should be able to finish without nodes crashing
i expected to drop the index
column names should be passed correctly in order to avoid error message that column doesn t exist
index creation should complete successfully
expected the index to be created
minimal impact on latency and constant slope of rebalancing nodes
progress to be made on the job and the job to have already completed the cluster is small so this should be a fast job image url
if this is related to url not key encoding json values then a clearer error message otherwise i would expect j a b c d 2 rows
import completed without a crash
i would expect foo to equal the primitive value foo considering the other examples on that page yielded the same results between the two implementations in other cases i tried
restore to complete
import completed without a crash
so it seems to me that the rust postgres driver is expecting a int2 to be sent using only 2 bytes and a int4 to be sent using only 4 bytes and complaining that it receives 8 bytes in both cases i m not sure if it a violation of the postgres wire protocol to send a smaller intn as int8 but definitely cockroachdb is at least behaving differently from postgresql in this scenario
the expected behavior is that the cancel command should stop the query
i would expect that the second select from txn b would return exactly what the first select returned
completing tpc c import
root version 26257 defaultdb select value 42 as v v value 42 1 row time version s
since there s no cockroach access it should not trigger such a high i o of jdb2 sda2 8

central west should be distributed just like central west json based on my understanding of current docs
cockroachdb should compile from source on ppc64le
the d option to the sql cli should normalize the database name in the same way they create database xxx does imo
my expected plan is the following tree field description group aggregate 0 count rows scalar render scan table test2 test2 created idx spans 2019 01 10t00 00 00z 7 rows
resulting files in the zip should have timestamps equivalent to when they were actually created

the request should be terminated immediately after the context is canceled

dump should succeed as with other tables
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen import data succeed
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen the validate of foreign keys would finish in a reasonable time perhaps the foreign key validation is actually not really necessary given we assume the exported data was valid and if it wasn t we still need it imported into another database
i should get results back not an error
i expect the original operation to be cancelled and an error not be printed to the logs

don t warn i m trying to use kql p is it possible that kibana doesn t treat dash as part of a term this also happens when i m searching for a specific field with hostname values that have dashes such as beat hostname auditbeat 1234
doesn t show object object
if i click on a term in the chart legend only one set of values line should be displayed not two
in this scenario i m not sure whether i d expect to go to the main infrastructure page or back to the last page i was on in the infrastructure area i d probably expect the former but latter is what happens guess that depends on convention used on other pages so that s not a bug unless you think it is but didn t expect it to say logs expected infrastructure
i d except to see the selected option added to the search box the search box just contains the original ho
i d except to see the six node names from the first screenshot at least there are just nine values listed all start with filebeat but none of them are the three i m looking for

graph is shown with data
metrics should show up and updating log indices settings should have no impact on container metrict detail page
either of the following would be acceptable 1 integrate the creation of at least one index pattern into the workflow of creating a new space or 2 when creating or modifying a space with no index patterns enforce that the index pattern management feature is enabled or 3 when a user attempts to access index pattern management feature but does not have access to that feature due to space restrictions role permissions or otherwise simply display a helpful error instead of exploding spectacularly

legend ranges should update
the dashboard should filter on the clicked item
data frame list should show all transforms
the form should be invalid a warning message should be displayed
only settings coming from installed plugins shall be presented on the advanced setting page seems that the current implementation merge together plugin settings override settings without checking if an overridden setting exist or not cc elastic kibana platform that is a behavior in between app team and platform team do you know if there was a historical reason to allow behavior or is just simply a wrong implementation
refresh button should fetch newly added services but not show an empty page
maps wms layer works with the same settings as coordinate map visualization
there is a checkbox in version switch in version which should be always checked and disabled since the value of min doc count is always set to 0 due to elastic docs docs url
expected is this chrome screenshot image url

the tooltip box expands to fit the data to a certain point and then if it still is exceeded then a scroll bar appears
the colour stays the same cc aaronjcaldwell
ui lets you save your edits without deleting the spaces after all they were a part of your original index so why would you need to edit them just to edit another attribute of the data frames creation process please see screenshot img width 703 alt screen shot 2019 05 29 at 2 37 52 pm src url
the page will not show integration links for disabled apps

the page should correctly display the job in stopping status
recommended filters should be limited in height to 10 with a scrollbar in safari they currently overflow and scroll is also broken
the layers select box should be set to the configured layer road map by default
it should filter on the term value clicked on we need to add an automated test for this
see configured units
only the aggregation would change leaving the field this makes it easier to switch from say max to avg to median to decide which works best
the timelion legend shows the value from actual via mouse hover selected interval for non auto interval lines graph as step
an easily readable table
allow field name visibility
as the elasticsearch url and xpack monitoring elasticsearch url settings are only marked as deprecated but not yet removed and neither setting is mentioned as a breaking change both settings should still work in version
after sso kibana returns the user to the original url
histogram with interval version is displayed this worked in version and earlier may be related to 34975 3524
the query matches 285 documents the visualization should show 285 as the count but it shows 111
the default index pattern should use the default time field specified on that patter that is correctly picked up by the api metrics field call but not used on the data call
should be able to see the monitor screen
after opening the saved visualization the
the server should be restarted to apply new changes
cluster alerts should be read only no editing it s best if we can add owner column that would indicated system vs user watches
no css weirdness
utc time should be the same as timestamp
y axis should be changed
a role with permissions to everything similar to superuser should be able to generate reports in kibana and should not require user intervention to manually set the xpack reporting roles allow for every role that needs reporting
all of the matched monitors are displayed
the close button should always be visible to close the detail panel and perhaps a scroll mechanism should be provided to view long detail text
i would except column for the other data have the same labels and colours as the non other data
sorting is in the a z order in chrome it is z a based on url display tables chrome is incorrect
pop up is not cut off and aligned with the edge of the view
new tab is opened with appropriate viz been displayed
the tooltip doesn t extend off the screen and is completely visible
the n a s should not be there instead actual accurate values should be shown
the name of the type of the field should pop up instead
the app will filter by status id etc
the navbar should be correctly updated according to the currently active route i suspect this line of code is not executed for plugins url l9
if the snapshot view shows data so should the node detail view if for some reason the privileges are not sufficient both the snapshot view and node detail view should show a message saying so and not a graphql error
kibana version and higher should render the hyperlink properly as previous versions of kibana did
show histogram over time
shows metric visualizations or reasons why it s not showing the current message is unhelpful
be able to select any item from the aggregation list
application loads successfully
expect a tile map to be displayed when loading coordinate region visualization types
the points should display with tooltips the points display if i break them down into separate documents
expected the events ingested column to be non zero
kibana ui should open up
no join error to occur unless there is a data mismatch
clearing the left field value should have no impact on specified values for right field
no borders to be drawn when border width is set to 0
pages to load without outputting warnings security errors
all plugins have a correct version number
if we have a band mode i m expecting to see 2 values on the legend one for the higher percentile and one for the lower percentile
fields do not step outside the boundary
i can connect the kibana docker image with an elastich search node using ingress without specifying ports
should be able to see all the servers
the remaining labels in x axis should be readable
expanding collapsing of history
1 dashboard should reflect data in new timezone
for the stats chard to still work and not have a console error
kibana app loaded nicely without error
the logic either needs to ignore disabled filters and apply a new one or ensure the updated filters are enabled
exclude filter should highlight in red background color image url
groupings should stay below the map view table view buttons
configuration is accepted without error note i have not ever had this working so i can t say exactly what i d expect it s certainly possible i m doing something wrong but m not finding anything
usage data queries should not return large objects like assets
default elastic map and shape are displayed
from most ideal to least ideal but still ok outcomes normal grouping preservation of the ad hoc group ad hoc group selection is gone but the elements stay where they were im all versions the resulting elements groups remain subject of selection drag drop hover box
hide the field throughout kibana
messaging ui elements for the basic license state would be shown as they are with a fresh install of the stack
saved search detail should respect dark theme as it did in previous versions of kibana
stable screen overview
it should describe events as system auth sudo for example
for step 5 no results should be found
on refresh anomalies table should have same results as before the refresh
the graph in the threshold watch should have a similar event count as seen in discover you can see from the images below each using logstash as the index pattern this was only logstash feed going into cluster that discover app shows on average 300 000 documents per 5 second bucket while graph in threshold watcher ui shows around 70 000 documents per 5 second bucket
i think the focus should go to the first actionable element on the selected tab as it currently works if we have an absolute date selected mar 29 2019 10 23 41 url
there should be some content
if an index is replaced that happens to be your default index then the id of the default index should be updated so it points to the replacement index pattern while the error screen is good for initial kibana usage it strongly implies that problem is a missing pattern when in fact actual error is that it can no longer find it s default pattern and needs you to pick a new one this needs to be made clearer on panel
workpad should be scaled up to fill window maintaining aspect ratio
a table is build showing offsets appropriately based upon the number of elements added
typing cpu should return fields that contain cpu
typing cpu should return fields that contain cpu
items in the visualization legend are arranged in a row not a column
i would expect the wmsclient to recognize the query parameters in the user supplied url as an object and extend that object with the additional parameters so getmap url gets constructed like url
the beat enrollment works
kibana should wait at least elasticsearch requesttimeout milliseconds for a long running query
can reference which visualizations are used in a given dashboard
it would be useful not to change the tab or even refresh the data in the inspector while the tab is open if you re investigating a discrepancy in request and page refreshes while you re looking at it it could be pretty annoying for user cc timroes
the server will log errors like proc kibana typeerror int cannot represent non 32 bit signed integer value proc kibana at coerceint users jk git justinkambic kibana node modules graphql type scalars js 36 11 proc kibana at graphqlscalartype serialize users jk git justinkambic node modules graphql type definition js 418 12 proc at completeleafvalue users jk git justinkambic node modules graphql execution execute js 701 37 at completevalue users jk git justinkambic node modules graphql execution execute js 649 12 execution execute 580 21 execution execute 556 21 resolvefield 497 10 364 18 array reduce anonymous executefields 361 42 772 10 completeobjectvalue 762 10 completevalue 660 12 completevalue 629 21 580 21 550 12 684 25 array foreach anonymous foreach iterall index 83 25 completelistvalue 680 24 completevalue 643 629
no error is thrown
step 1 should have failed
ideally more room on page could be given to the pattern name as a short term fix perhaps some hover text would make it easier to identify
the search will be applied to select fields in our hb index
there should be an accurate reflection of the current values displayed by the chart
see discussion above
the tooltip background container should be the same width as the tooltip text

warning you don t have permissions like in ccr and rollups image url
infra ui to work
in previous versions of kibana up to and including version when i hover over a value in the legend i can then click anywhere in the dark grey area to then show the magnifiers meaning i don t have to click directly on the value itself
results should be returned
accessing other restricted areas results in a permissions error for example accessing watcher you do not have permission to manage watches please contact your administrator
buttons to filter values
should be linked to current available manual page about the issue

there are shards and their allocation to individual nodes on index details page
node overview page contains proper node name
the url should only update once and not duplicate the hash search string in an encoded copy at the end of the url
the transaction details should show up like it does with any other transaction not ending in a
the messages from the delayed response should be added to the logs ui
should remove the tags from the list
i know that we probably use data from the remote clusters for ccr monitoring stats but if there is no ccr configured we should skip the check for the remote clusters since we don t display any data about it in the monitoring page so it s basically of no use
kibana keep waiting until the 503 stops
icons should be visible on navbar
the x axis correctly reflects the year bucket it s associated with
the button should either work as expected or at least show an error message with a description of what to do

expect the items to nest underneath the first row of items as it s showing when you toggle the filters button
should be a timepicker
top 5 values are displayed
should show data on a map
img width 1440 alt screen shot 2019 02 14 at 10 59 27 am src url
legend contains a human friendly value such as no data available
all icons on the kibana left navbar must be visible after i click on my plugin icon
have a scroll so you can see all fields
it should be clear to the person looking at the upgrade assistant ui that those critical notices are referring to a required reindex before upgrading to elasticsearch version and not a problem with their current stack one suggestion is if kibana version detects the nodes are all or at least one at version then show a congratulations message once kibana is also at version then it would show these critical messages but again should that say upgrade assistant
no error would be produced
as many structured data outputs as there are lines in sample data
prob should be rendered as an overlay position absolute and background color

points on a map
grids should be properly aligned irrespective of aggregation

kibana version needs to be compatible with elasticsearch version as that s the order we tell customers to upgrade
run tests without issues
the edit ui should show up
x axis should be limited by whathever was stipulated on the timepicker labels should all show up if filter labels is not selected labels should not repeat if there is a small number of buckets additionally if the chart style is bar it would make more visual sense if the time label is centered on the bucket instead of coming before bucket

there should be nginx metrics for hosts that have nginx data
the kibana server applies the deprecation transformations prints deprecation warnings on stdout or stderr and proceeds to startup process
expected behavior is that the follower index should be created at the very least kibana needs to inform the user that something is wrong currently there is absolutely no indication that there is even a problem in order to fix this you have to go to dev tools in the version cluster and do something like put template metricbeat soft deletes index patterns metricbeat settings index soft deletes enabled true
the system should give more information to the user
if toggle ing this store primaries on there should be only blue line left on that graph

short url works well except for default space
page should work as expected
continues graphs no errors
should create a chrome debug log file with non fatal logs and exit
i think it would be preferable if the index management page didn t show indices that the user didn t have access to and then kibana should also not try to get the docs count and storage size for those indices and then the errors wouldn t appear these errors don t prevent user from managing indices that they do have full privs on note that this user can run get cat indices so they can already see which exist so from that perspective index mgmt ui doesn leak any new information so it s really just errors are an issue
should load page

the postinstall of the package should trigger the systemctl daemon reload

either the data deleted only from the one space or a warning prompt to only delete the visualization
i would expect to see the output configuration instead i am redirected to the add data page
the lists should contain options
expected behavior is that key is escaped correctly and works whether or not there is a pound sign one solution would be some function to escape it documentation indicates url key url should escape it but this does not work in this context giving an error that url is not valid
as soon as you supply a new search for the new index pattern it should cancel the previous one and only provide the result for the new input

i expect that the autocomplete will work when the option is enabled unless there is some other means of enabling the feature
see the edge screenshot above
in previous versions when pulling the dashboard you would get associated index patterns as well it seems like this behavior has changed or there was a regression of some kind i m not entirely sure if this api makes any additional calls to get the index patterns but from what i noticed locally as well as what s mentioned in url issuecomment it appears that the api saved objects find api url has suffered a regression curl xget localhost 9200 api saved objects find type index pattern search fields title search metric error root cause type illegal argument exception reason request saved objects find contains unrecognized parameters search search fields did you mean stored fields type illegal argument exception reason request saved objects find contains unrecognized parameters fields did you mean stored status 400 this seems like a second issue but i wanted to bring it up in case the export dashboards leverages it or similar logic bmcconaghy
kibana listens on both ipv6 and ipv4 localhost addresses
all of the executions provide the same chart setting elasticsearch shardtimeout to the default 30000 provided consistency across executions
should have current date time timestamps
version should be backwards compatible with report generation urls from version users would not be happy if their existing watches that generate pdf reports break on a minor release

the default ordering should be alphabetical this is especially relevant when mixing and matching dashboards from e g beats this is a different default from version where dashboards are listed alphabetically by default
the shard legend should show all shards of the index consistent with the output of cat shards
there should only be a single right side y axis when applicable and all data series assigned to a seaprate y axis should use the same y axis rather than draw an additional one

return the json object
filter added to the filter bar
to be able to recover from errors

i would think it should match the numbers shown
tsvb displays a valid field list in the field drop down menu
i expect my default index setting to be stored like everything else but it doesn t seem to be getting preserved
see the page which was requested
the msearch query generated by the
no timeout is shown
we expect that user would be redirected to visualization he had opened before he got logged out due to session timeout

i would think all visualizations should be consistent and set that attribute true so tests can know when it s done
no session timout warning shown
no horizontal scroll bar should be visible
see message no results found instead of empty table visualisation
page should load
table width will change according to screen size or at least according to upper bar

when i configure the layers with kibana yml as below it properly works regionmap false regionmap layers 0 name departments of france regionmap layers 0 url url regionmap layers 0 attribution inrap 0 fields name department fields description full department name fields 1 name insee fields 1 description insee numeric identifier
the value should be 0 or disappear so that i can order the table by this column

you should be able to enter the watcher ui to fix the issue even though it really doesn t seem to be an issue
the filters should be pinned
should this say not found instead
no errors and a new index
i d expect to be able to sort the last two columns to see the biggest smallest indices
in the past it s started up nearly immediately even with large plugins installed x pack and others there was no significant delay

the circle color is the same as the line color such as if only use 1 axis the circle color is same as line color image url
filters should work on visualizations
the filter should be added to the request
if the port is not specified and http schema is on the url port should be 80 by default which is the solution i figured out the previous kibana yml file works if you modify elasticsearch url value to elasticsearch url url plus on verbose mode kibana should be more specific with log to es currently is type log timestamp 2018 05 17t15 23 59z tags status plugin elasticsearch version error pid 1 state red message status changed from yellow to red request timeout after 3000ms prevstate yellow prevmsg waiting for elasticsearch maybe a message kind of connecting to could help catch this kind of errors

i believe that docusaurus should strip markdown out of page descriptions when generating them
just show referencing site documents image url and not show span id jump part when on real website
write what you thought would happen
the footer renders consistently across all pages
sidebas exhibit the same scroll behavior they do in chrome write what you thought would happen
the docusaurus examples script should copy the config files listed in the docs here url verifying installation root directory dockerfile readme md docker compose yml docs doc1 md doc2 md doc3 md exampledoc4 exampledoc5 website blog 2016 03 11 blog post 2017 04 10 blog post two 2017 09 25 testing rss 2017 09 26 adding rss 2017 10 24 new version version core footer js package json pages sidebars json siteconfig js static
the server is suposed to start and when i do changes inside the website folder the webpage is suposed to reload with the new changes e g when i change a label on headerlinks section changes are suposed to be visible
being able to add a custom page similar to any other markdown page with the only difference the content is written using react
table of content should render that header as context status write what you thought would happen
the expected behavior is that the heading will see its child anchor and inherit the hash id from it instead of using its text content to generate the hash
there would be a subcategory present with the links to the subdirectory as declared
the local server will start
write what you thought would happen i expect to get all the demo files after running docusaurus init command i e this directory structure root directory docs examples from docusaurus doc1 md doc2 md doc3 md exampledoc4 md exampledoc5 website blog examples from docusaurus 2016 03 11 blog post 2017 04 10 blog post two 2017 09 25 testing rss 2017 09 26 adding rss 2017 10 24 new version version core footer js package json pages sidebars json siteconfig js static
jump to the foo bar section
i expected to see the new page rendered in my dev server as well as the sidebar updated while previously released version docs are unchanged
example 1 expected do that to be 2 example 2 expected code tabs to be properly indented and nested inside the numbered list
the above steps should generates a proper link to doc2 html in both dev server and also when the site is built for publishing
should have html tab image url
write what you thought would happen the title and sidebar label of the first page of the docs for the versioned docs are accurate
write what you thought would happen
everything is all good so i can run npm start
show logo as usual write what you thought would happen
the header should contain html meta property og url content url
it should automatically show a scrollbar in the table of contents if there are too many items
refer to so post
this is how it should render in all systems url
images are rendered even when docsurl configuration is used
that if an issue with a link arose the new website would not be published
when there are no headerlinks and the navbar appears it should appear directly below the title bar
when running the website locally the image should be shown
output should be an h2 followed by ul ul
there s no gap in the header
i expected the title content to change after restarting the dev server i expected to see the new page in the side bar
the sidebar should not contain broken links
the site would be published
expected to see the image or text of the rendered markdown now the raw markdown text
search results with a good ux
site works both locally and when published
run prod see that the custom highlighting should be picked up
a normally formatted post img width 1920 alt screen shot 2018 09 07 at 1 54 40 pm 2 src url
demos folder will be part of the build folder
should navigate to itself
the title of the page and label on the sidebar are expected to be different
errors should not be thrown
the urls should be like url
i would expect the output to be highlighted differently between text and js code blocks like this text function inithighlight block cls try if cls search bno highlight b 1 return process block true 0x0f class cls catch e handle exception for var i 0 2 i classes length i if checkcondition classes undefined console log undefined export inithighlight js function inithighlight block cls try if search bno highlight b 1 return process block true 0x0f class catch e handle exception for var 0 2 classes length if checkcondition classes undefined console log undefined export inithighlight
then image should show up
i think renaming doc files should be supported
should only runs tests related to the changes since the provided branch
all the generated snapshots have the same indentation
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
if a test succeeds when running the test using test only the test should also succeed when running all tests with the option runinband
the testenvironment file is transformed
test title ought to be clear test title as it is on node js v8 and v10
given we already produced the snapshot corresponding to this test re running it should succeed with no error current behavior is the follwoing jest fail main test js works with incomplete surrogate pairs 8ms works with incomplete surrogate pairs expect received tomatchsnapshot snapshot name works with incomplete surrogate pairs 1 snapshot received 50 51 test works incomplete surrogate pairs 52 expect u d801 tomatchsnapshot 53 54 at object tomatchsnapshot main test js 52 24 1 snapshot failed summary 1 failed from 1 suite inspect your code changes or run npm run jest u to update them suites failed total tests failed total snapshots total time version s ran all suites
the tests run as they should
i would have expected the assertion to fail with the first variant above
jest runs correctly
the function registered by the beforeall is never executed this bug was reported in url and fixed in url but it reappeared
npm install save dev ts jest
jest tells me that the error happened in the same manner it does when i run the describe block jest also shouldn t complain about a describe callback shouldn t have a return value which it does even if i m running the describe block let me know if you d like me to make a separate issue for this
i would expect jest to not go beyond a certain number of workers if the argument is not specified
the test above should fail the async assertion should be ignored towards the assertion count the promise chain where expect is executing is not part of test we can tell that because test is not marked as failing even with a blatantly broken assertion when expect runs test is complete and should not be counted as part of assertioncount in jest
pass test unit testargsskipped test js test arguments are skipped during title parameter injection given d returns value my object 1ms
i expect tothrow and tothrowerror to work consistently in both typescript and babel environment
jest shouldn t try to run that test
i expected a text summary of code coverage at the end which would list total percentages of covered lines etc
both tests pass
i expect the repl to succeed instead the repl throws javascript heap out of memory by jest
using jest with the same number of workers than cores should always equal or improve the execution time of jest maxworkers 1
the app js test should pass
test should pass as lodash foo returns 5 as specified in mock lodash js
i expected the following two objects to be equal const foo a in in const bar a in in
tests should run
i would expect both tests to pass
it change path and can correct require file
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
tests should work as before
i want coverage reports to output
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen if you are using internationalization then it should show the correct language
jest should run my tests
the file paths in the coverage report should reflect working directory where the jest test was ran from breakpoints are hit rootdir should be set to the project root in current working directory path not location of source folder drive is mapped from
the stored snapshot would be the string wibble wibble instead it is stored and matched as an object like this exports basic should match base 1 object 0 w 1 i 10 b 11 l 12 e 2 b 3 b 4 l 5 e 6 7 w 8 i 9 b note that during testing when there is a snapshot mismatch even in the string the reverse happens a simple string like wobble wobble shows as an object with characters out of order this is applied to received value making debugging with longer strings very hard
done finishes an async test immediately
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
the style length of the child element created in by setting innerhtml should be 0 javascript var element parent queryselector div expect element style length tobe 0
yarn audit does not report any issues related to url
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen install jest with no warning
i would expect the component name in the snapshot to be something like memo componentname
expected the coverage data to be collected and put out to the console
i would expect jest circus and jest jasmine2 to run the same set of tests unless this is an intentional difference smile
test coverage should be 100 due to having a test around resolves await and rejects if the async value is removed the coverage is 100 but the function needs to be async for the then in it appears to be happening on all of our async functions
test coverage should be 100 due to having a test around resolves await and rejects if the async value is removed the coverage is 100 but the function needs to be async for the then in it
while i would expect some overhead for module resolution i would not expect such a drastic difference in speeds if this is expected is it documented somewhere
from the discussion in 7443 i guess that non enumerable symbolic properties were omitted from the snapshot to reduce the snapshot size and remove unimportant information however in case of enzyme all the properties in shallow ly wrapped component instance are non enumerable props url l268 url l273 as such i m unsure if you would like to consider this as a bug in jest or something that enzyme should be fixing
all existing tests should pass with yarn jest no cache runinband
it should start jest in watch mode
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen jest version should not be 67 slower than jest version for the same set of tests
i d like the examples to work on my machine
can see i18n documents
since jest does not perform any checks related to typings it makes sense to me that type information should be stripped and other babel plugins should be applied before mocks are hoisted as jest claims i reference an out of scope variable actually a type this does not seem to be the case to me and simenb who looked at this after i gave up this seems like a bug
jest cache should depend on babel version and should be busted when babel version changes
pass the test case i know i could use something like tothrow err message to pass it but i want to check the error type also
xmlserializer should work as expected support for it was added to jsdom in v13 url issuecomment
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
rejects tothrow correct detects the thrown excection
the test should be executed successfully
coverage report should read like coverage summary statements version 890 24731 branches version 169 17656 functions version 125 7858 lines version 875 15638
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
it should work properly with react navigation scrollview class
jest cli should run this test and output the testing result
i expect to be able to run the projects just like if they were defined in a config file which does work
the provided path will be used for prettier
i expect the default mock behavior to be restored after the test with the mockimplementationonce has completed
jest will point to right line that caused error
jest should work with npm pnpm and yarn
i expect all setupfiles to be sourced from the exact same location
i think pretty format should fail the test with an informative message instead of letting the jest node process die if the serialisation is about to fill the heap one way to do this could be to abort object serialisation when when test would otherwise time out it takes much longer than default test timeout of 5 seconds to run out of memory on my late 2013 macbook pro bash jest expect document git master time y jest yarn run v version users theneva code jest expect document node modules bin runs index test js last few gcs redacted js stacktrace redacted info visit url for documentation about this command yarn version s user version s system 185 cpu version total
2 different blobs instances are not eqaul
the test should be able to include mixins as subclass
i expect the number of workers between normal runs and watch mode to be equal i expect the cli doc for maxworkers to reflect the actual defaults i expect a run of all tests in watch mode vs normal runs to be much closer to each other in run time
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
i think the proper behavior would be to tear down environments after a test file each test file is done and allow garbage collector to do it s job
the test is being executed without throwing an unexpected token
jest should update code when after running with updatesnapshot javascript it should update snapshot function expect hello tomatchinlinesnapshot hello
excecpted jest to stop and return to my console
test finish and script exits
per the docs url updating snapshots i was hoping to see in the console the snapshot options if i change one of the components for example i dont see diff in console or option to update snapshot
using the following package json json name jestbug devdependencies jest version bash rm rf node modules npm install npx jest listtests no cache projects jestbug app atest test js projects jestbug app atest test js projects jestbug app subfolder atest test js projects atest test js app subfolder tests tests tests using the following package json json name devdependencies jest version jest testregex tests spec jsx bash rm rf node modules npm install npx listtests no cache subfolder subfolder
it should keep the new line characters on the generated snapshot something like this exports generatebreakline should generate snapshot 1 object description this is a test with a new line
i would expect that the snapshot files that just got written to wouldn t be considered instantly obsolete speculation it looks like the custom snapshotresolver isn t invoked when analyzing obsolete snapshots so jest doesn t know that these files were actually written to or something else is weird
node js should be supported
since it works with me manually running yarn test and it ll transpile and tests correctly the other cases should do that aswell i e anything else than me running the jest command
i can get env value in beforeall hook and each test case but can not get env value in describe block as you can see the stdout a describe scope env undefined expect get env value in describe block
per the setupfile documentation i would expect the setupfile to run once per test instead of once per test file
i don t expect jest to re run tests when only the access time changes i would expect it to re run tests when the modified time changes or new files are added etc
both should produce the same snapshot as writing it either way won t fail the actual test for wrapper text however the result shows that they produce different snapshots
i would expect anything in test file would be executed after the globalsetup is resolved
the beforeall block should run before a parameterized test in order to match the behavior in non parameterized tests
the source code line it leaves my async alone async done should stay untouched
to be able to exit process when calling done after disconnecting from server and db
the test should pass as is does in jsdom environment or running the following code in node t tconst util require util t tconst enc new util textencoder utf 8 t t console log uint8array prototype isprototypeof enc encode fsdfsd
image url mark the red box i m not find the uncoverage line of 33 34 and branch 50
i would expect the test to succeed because the second call matches the expectation if i use tohavebeenlastcalled in the previous code then test is green so matching as such seems to be accurate
function coverage should be 100
test fails with done called multiple times or some such message
something like expect object tocontain value expected object to contain value mycontent 7 expect shallow field title hello content mycontent find span tocontain mycontent at the right line and file name
expect the test to run when i down grade to babel 6 x it works as expected when i try to use babel 7 it fails a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen when i run npm t i get the following error bash test suite failed run couldn t find preset env relative directory users rbiggs desktop jest test at node modules babel core lib transformation file options option manager js 293 19 at array map anonymous
the behavior should yield the same result as the local run with the same node and npm version where it passes
i expect not to get the above error message
no error throws with the second config
jest runs correctly
js let mockfn new mockfunction 6 console log mockfn temp this gives undefined instead of 6 a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
the window property should take the new defined value
all properties added to the object are checked strictly and not just message acceptance criteria url must fail url must pass
not seeing this error message despite the test case passing
the error should not happen
15 test to have said passed but at least expecting 14 pass and 1 fail
the test passes
jest should be working with pnpm
it should throw a error of threshold too even if i put it inside the projects of jest configure
the code from a beforeall should not be executed when the describe it is part of is skipped
it should show the diff between the expected and actual values
it should retry n times when jest retrytimes n is set
the test run should exit with an error message instead of continuing indefinitely additionally it would be great with feedback on why the test failed via something like simenb s pr url
jest tests should run properly
would expect the ts files to be covered by jest coverage
every file inside src should be reported on jest coverage
the test suite should fail like it does if the error were thrown in a top level afterall
my tests should run properly
the passed in object should not be mutated
running jest should be able to run the test which includes an import statement the babel node command of the minimal repo executes the import successfully
any console log console error in the worker should be visible at the end and not cause the whole test to fail
at least jest should not throw preferred behavior be able to test react native app with react navigation url and aws amplify url with it
the first test should fail with a timeout error the second test should pass
test each should run tests by passed cases
import should work as expected
i only wanted to specify snapshotname the docs say it s the second argument url snapshotname i have no idea what property matchers are and am not currently interested in them the docs fail to mention their format i passed null because i don t know what their default value is the docs fail to mention that too couldn t figure out for quite some time why my tests were failing expected null to be treated as a missing value for propertymatchers instead of trying treat it as some kind of a shape
error objects with custom fields should be deep checked
tests to succeed which is happening now and coverage to be 100 everywhere
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen no errors
i expect the default jest test included with create react app will run without error
i expect the jest to import the antd component like any other module and execute the tests on it
expected the following snapshot to be generated object data object foo any string t bar bar
to see only test success message
with the steps above test noop js should not be executed but it is
coverage to stay consistent and not change for the files that are not changed
i expect the function to be called and the test to pass when i test in the browser it works as expected
before version a test that had no body would automatically be skipped and would not throw an error in the test report
jest should pick up the file change for the transpiled js file and figure out that it corresponds to the source ts file which is tracked and modified in git it then should run the tests for that file
test should be runing
tests should pass
mock function should not break instanceof function test
the expected behavior is that this would produce an informative error about the substring being contained within the how are you string when it is expected not to be
when dealing with a typed array that array s buffer property should always be instanceof arraybuffer
it should be added to line coverage i created a new constants namespace for my repo
i expected jest to update the failed snapshots from the previous run
no syntax error should be thrown from adding newlines
jest should return an error leading user to the right direction instead of saying no tests found and exist with 1 most user will likely start to adjust testmatch or testregex which is the wrong direction of debugging
the response is sent successfully so i d not expect any errors here especially a 404 paste the results here js hello error error not found at context basic404 as handler home jsarnowski workshop fastify static error node modules fastify lib fourohfour js 52 26 at prehandlercallback home jsarnowski workshop fastify static error node modules fastify lib handlerequest js 112 30 at prevalidationcallback home jsarnowski workshop static node modules lib handlerequest js 101 5 at handler home jsarnowski workshop static node modules lib handlerequest 70 5 handlerequest 19 5 onrunmiddlewares 357 7 middlewarecallback 338 7 object routehandler as handler 324 7 router lookup find my way index 338 14 router defaultroute 635 23

i would expect that fastify loads the plugins as expected but will continue to allow route registration until listen is called js const fastify require fastify const fp require fastify plugin const plugin fp function opts next next const start async function app app register plugin await app ready this will not throw an error and will allow you to register the route app post test function start
child should be present in type logger

on aws lambda plugins should as expected
i expect fastify to not mutate the data i put into it especially when the subject are json schema definitions as one would most probably like to reuse them as much as possible
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen paste the results here ts fastify get api xx function req res this this points to fastifyinstance
i ve expected throwing is async and normal functions to work the same way i e passing the error to seterrorhandler function and not crashing the app
the console should output 1 2 what happens instead 1 1 2 2
the response should contain the remoteaddress but it is empty
no exception thrown
for prehandler1 i would expect to see abc returned as a reply i looked at the async hook unit tests and they check for reply send and throw but i don t see any async hooks tests that check for return at all i don t think am doing anything unexpected so hopefully just a bug that can be squashed quickly
app starts without errors
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen paste the results here js
npm package only contains the files to support runtime and development time like d ts unrelated files should not be published
i expect to get in my fastify route request from users 4abc2 a request param id to be instead of id 4abc2 paste the results here const id request params console log id 4abc2
error message implies that the default 404 handler should deal with it
not sure if it s a bug but it seems we should have multiple header entries for each cookie if we are calling reply header multiple times for setting the cookies more details are given in this link url this may fix the issue this headers key this headers key concat value
i don t expect the thrown s error the schema is raccomended by the standard url so maybe i m missing something or this field should be ignored if i remove the schema field all is working js delete schema body schema
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen paste the results here js
how would you like this to work instead show the right icon
i would expect the unicode to work but be able to type words
a tooltip based on an existing title element would appear when hovering over the fontawesome icon using all major browsers including internet explorer
it compiles without error
license declaration for package and actual license text should match
the lettering should swap to the secondary colour
the facebook and google icon should be visible
how would you like this to work instead
i expect to see the duotone icon to replace the standard ul bullet point
how would you like this to work instead i need the circular version of the facebook logo as shown on the website
works fine in chrome image url works fine if getting rid of the second resource loaded with subresource integrity check image url
all the icons should work
this should only happen when the text field is not in focus
the description should wrap at the boundary of div
it should solve the current challenge and present the following one
response with user data should be returned
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen i expected to accept the my changing in a code by github
no more weekly emails
i expect the go to the coding curriculum button to redirect me to learn freecodecamp org
previously this code was saved and you could check your work to help with future problems if you log out this is still the behavior you get but then you obviously can t save long term progress or completion
expected to be signed in to my old account
you should see the certificate if you have it or be redirected to settings and informed looks like user developmentuser is not responsive web design certified if you don t
should maybe reject any non codepen github links i know individual project checking is not done but at least this adds a bit of integrity to these final projects
there should not be any white space and the green should transition straight to dark grey unless this is a design choice but i don t think so as the same white space is not visible on other pages
i expected the dark theme to load as usual with a dark grey background but it fails to load or the color of the background is wrong
when zoom is at 100 we should be able to see the most recent progress
i would expect a search page populated with relevant results to what i typed into the search bar the typed in text should still be in the search bar
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
role application
should throw an error or should not render invalid code
this should be tackled as chrome appends by default to any domain url you copy so people who would copy url from search bars will get urls appended with hence producing wrong results
i expected to see number of donators
navigating to any new page should leave the main nav menu closed or close it if it was open
images should be centered
all the tests pass since i didnt change anything in the code
search results should come under the search bar width should be same or less than the search bar disabling position absolute works but breaks in full search bar
expected to see my progress on the heat map
in step 3 the browser should reload mirroring the changed markdown
according to the guide i should be able to visit both url and url however i m only able to see the client side and nothing loads on port 3000
the page should not scroll down when loading the scrollbar should go away when not needed
once we get to the url site and press enter we expect the query to remain and receive a list of results instead of a blank
the query should not have any trailing quotation marks
the button should expand appropriately and text should not overflow
the test suite should run
on pressing ctrl enter after downloading the solution we should be taken to the next challenge as it is the shortcut for submit and go to next challenge ctrl enter it should not download the solution again
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
to be signed into curriculum when you are signed into the rest of fcc
test should pass with correct solution
it should return instead it returns undefined i ve tested it on both chrome version official build 64 bit and firefox version 64 bit
we should have only one username per email address
no error should appear and i assume redirect to localhost 8000 should happen
recieved should be spelled received
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen i would expect something like attempted to modify immutable string object in the output of console rather than a silent failure
the separator should be clicked very easy
pr should pass all the builds to allow qas to merge prs to repo
there shouldn t be a horizontal scroll bar and site width should be reduce
the search auto complete dropdown should be displayed properly
button should be fully readable
the heat map should render properly displaying three blocks of different colors as of writing this issue instead of being empty
filename should be truncated to match the length restrictions on ms windows
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen the screen reader mode should have stayed enabled across lessons
an image link should appear in the markdown for example if the markdown were link img example png url i would expect this to produce the same structure as github p a href url rel nofollow img src user repo raw branch img example png alt link style max width 100 a p
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen i expect to be able to push or pull
gogs works fine and i can access my repository created before in the last container since i keep the root gogs volume
expected both http to https change and port 3000 to customport change to stick after install neither did
see middle section of screenshots in 1415 1416
a new pr is created
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
when network connectivity is lost and then regain gogs should rebind itself to it s ports
expect gogs to read the correct config path provided by the arg config
installation should occur with no errors
being able to login again after 1st login
a list of the repositories of the given user
the auth source should be set to local after the 200 response
pr redirect to repository a
instead of the error above the repository should be checked out
a page of documentation
no error message as it s a valid email address imo if the gogs admin user wants to enter complete gibberish into the email address field for a manually created account so be it it s their install and that decision and its consequences are on them an option to disable the email address field validation especially when registration is disabled in the config would be quite useful
any use of the token should be reflected in the tokens last used timestamp
email subject should be mytag gogs test email
everything nice and smooth
the server should check when someone is uploading orphans attachment attachments not bounded to a valid repository and release and refuse to save files for invalid repositories releases and for unauthenticated users
a pull request should be created
a 202 http status is returned
handle error silently
i would expect after removing the file updating the history and force pushing to the master branch that gogs would acknowledge the changes made gogs should update repo size unless i m missing something crucial which is highly possible
packager io builds should have the same feature set as binary builds
it should move to the next field versions
archive succeeded versions
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
this odd gap must not be there
black screen will not be there and my view goes up inside the navigation bar which will not happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
collectionviewcell need to move down to previous place
ui should go back from the top to the original position
it should show toolbar done button and focus the selected textfield point versions
at a minimum it shouldn t say button twice apple s apps also don t seem to mention toolbars so i d recommend these labels become previous next title and done respectively versions
when iqkeyboardmanager is disabled the top of the uitableview remains pinned to the bottom of the uisearchbar uinavigationbar this behavior should be consistent with iqkeyboardmanager enabled in this sort of view it is not necessary to specify layout constraints manually
shouldn t have white space
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
expect spacing to be like it was in version
i would expect the kb to dismiss and stay dismissed based on the debug showlog it appears that the kb is hidden dismissed but is then re shown
the search bar should stay at the top of the view until the user dismisses it with a done or similar
empty spaces should not appear
alertcontroller will be shown versions
the keyboard should come all the way up and the screen scroll upward
the safe area insets should be unchanged in this case so the view doesn t snap under the notch
the whole view should be keep below the bottom base line navigation bar
last textfield should have a blue done button or for our german keyboard fertig versions
expected for the uicollectionview or its container to shift vertically to make room for the keyboard so that the uitextfield would be shown while editing
keyboard accessory show as well
i expected the view to offset such that the cursor would be visible above the keyboard and would then scroll and or offset to keep the cursor in view as i type
shows configuration for that approle allows login via approle
i expect it to trust the unknown authority and join the cluster
should return the secret as array
the endpoint should return counter data instead it returns 500 because the request can t be audited
i expect the vault to unseal if any keys are invalid i would either expect all of them to be invalid or none of them i initialize seal and unseal using a number of shell scripts have done so many times in e g the last six months this used to work until a couple of weeks ago the issue occurs for the first time today with new versions v version and v version i am reasonably certain there are no copy paste or other trivial errors involved
vault would work normally as expected the client s ip instead of loadbalancer ip would be visible in the vault audit logs
the form input used to be multi line or file selection which allowed multi line input this allowed the certificate data to save properly
explanation of what active standby high availability means in the world of vault especially when using non consul backends the documentation is very vague and does not discuss why this is useful or define the terms within the document
the above redirect uri should reference the remote server vault ip the intended behavior is that the browser is redirected back to vault not localhost
be able to unseal vault after init
secrets path should be enabled by default
api call should return the entity
vault should return 204 no content when providing a dash in the end of the key
authentication should happen token returned
vault should not get sealed
when reading a single k v secret and auditing to the dev null device i expect to see relatively high cpu utilization and high throughput of requests served under this configuration however it is not possible to exceed around 30 cpu utilization on our hardware
i think the client secret should be able to be retrieved
vault should start up and should be able to retried data from backend etcd storage
the nuclear reactor policy should be visible in the ui against the entity with corresponding okta alias user1
signed cert ttl should be what you set previously
the error response url should be not malformed
standby node become active shortly after active node is down
the response suggested by the documentation
n a documentation bug
unseal keys retrieved from backup
ability to use postgresql 11 as a storage backend i also expect the storage documentation to list what versions of the storage applications are working supported
the full configuration options should be available via the web interface similar to the cli for users who prefer that or want to learn the product easier
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
entity id field is included in the output of the vault write format json auth approle login too
either vault should delete empty folders so they won t get listed beforehand or executing the list command on an empty folder should give an empty answer stating that there is no item in it
standby servers should provide their own metrics instead of forwarding the metrics call to active server this would make more sense from monitoring perspective
go get should get the dependencies and throw no errors
according to the api docs url there is no way to update just a value so maybe vault performs two requests when calling the vault kv patch one for reading and one for updating anyways the generated command
i would expect to see an empty json object
roles can be definied universally and assigned to all database or selected database after role creation statement and previus the database creation statement
my postgresql allows me symbol in password i spent a lot of time finding what exactly broken my config
expect to be issued a token
query parameters should be supported by the agent
after receiving a request from a non whitelisted ip vault should continue accepting http requests from whitelisted ips
trim leading trailing whitespaces in keys if this is not desired consider to alert the user in the web ui in such cases also consider to alert the user if there are leading trailing whitespaces in the corresponding value however trimming value may not be beneficial general modifying normalizing passwords automatically is a bad idea
i expect a better error message indicating the problem the message is about an enterprise feature of vault and misleading optionally i would like to have this handled by the vault cli i want to make a new login so the previous login should not play a role
well any valid path should be valid to store my ca crt on
the key shares and key threshold will be the same as i input and the screen will show new key just like documents url
wouldn t expect to see the logs around no tls config found nor the gcs api errors around connection reset by peer
secret is properly stored
see the content of the secret
i would think a sane default would allow users to update their own passwords if there is a way to do this with policies i ve been unable to determine how i have tried using something like the following but it allows all users to update all other users passwords expected because of the wildcard also seems the policy paths for userpass don t support identity entity name id path auth userpass users capabilities update
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
we get a certificate with tls web client authentication extended usage with a cn value of cn foo
the preflight check should succeed
the check boxes should be shown
being connected within the session of the token provided through the vault token environment variable when i execute vault login or vault login token different value than vault token as described in warning message and documentation
vault should try to connect to the host pointed at by the vault host in our case this is resolved to version 16 private ip through consul instead vault attempts to connect url as indicated by the error message auth handler error authenticating error put url dial tcp version 8200 connect connection refused backoff version
all upper case in service tags should not been converted in low case
vault should validate the string store it and then it ll get passed along to the totplib unmodified
the role should be deleted and should see success data deleted if it existed at ssh roles everyone on stdout
catch the empty or otherwise non printable key in the list returned by list and print a descriptive error to stdout and move on to the next key
vault runs with mlock support and no warnings whether using official hc binary or ports compiled freebsd version
users in the admin group can see and edit policies in the ui
i expect stream redirection to redirect error output
the api should not fail i suspect it is because the request result is not paginated so the syslog size increases with time making the api fail as well
configuration from the ui and vault ci should result in identical configurations
3 vault kv list secret 1 keys 2
the given method in api docs works
engine should be configured with the shown 30 minutes default ttl or the menu should show 0 as a default
i would like to see only headers i set or default headers and headers i set i would like to have ability remove headers without delete cors config and set config
expected refresh interval to appear in the cli output
expected the same values in the output when using format json vs format table
log into vault ui using okta and okta verify app token should stay valid for it s ttl and then request renewal and okta verify mfa prompt
the test should pass since according to another existing test case url l47 in the same test file path should match if optionalparamregex is not present in the url similarly a b foo should also have matched the pattern a b genericnameregex val optionalparamregex val2 with val capturing foo
map the service account and read the password with ad read ad credes poc test
i would expect the data field in the response from decrypt key to look like json batch results plaintext however it actually looks like json batch results
the usual response delivering the client token as is perfectly working when using iam without infering ec2 instances
show the user his root token or recovery keys as normally
appropriate groups should be returned
vault starts up and uses the database
setup postgres plugin at the mount path that was setup
no error message
displaying the object returned from the cli
the correct aws region should be detected from the ec2 instance profile
ui should display the entry properly
the list secrets should work as expected with the given policy and also since read secret version seems to be functioning without any issues
you should be able to edit anything under secret devops
both certificates should contain an othername field
configuration file include port property
vault should be able to connect to the etcd3 cluster via the grpc proxy
an error message to the requesting user or within vault s logging that the role either isn t allowed on that database or the database configuration doesn t allow that role
i expected vault to start up and let me unseal it like all previous upgrades
the github auth method should work
docs and actual behavior should be consistent
successful login
vault can handle many credentials being created and revoked at the same time
a confirmation dialog should appear asking for the policy deletion
connected rds mssql users who have their lease expired revoked have their access revoked and are disconnected from the database
web ui cli shoud fill whole web page
expected to get credentials back
the output should contain the new temporary iam credentials which can be used to login to aws cli
i expect consistency between the two csr
i think the answer should be consistent in both cases for authenticated and non authenticated clients as well
it should return 200 with an empty list
the migration should run
the secret should be created without error
no empty line at the beginning
the website documentation and path help mention list operation i m not sure if vault team is willing to break client interface since it s version
link should work
memory goes down again or plateaus
increase value added to original ttl value
should not error integers or booleans should be converted to a string form and returned in the map string string response
successful setup of totp key under jzarnett 40example com
vault should be checking existence of a policy name that is attached to a role or log anything to the main log in case it can t resolve policy name
create new version should work the same if json is toggled on or off
vault can be install using homebrew on macos with cgo enabled so connections can be made to vault servers using vpn connections
modest memory growth as a function of inherited groups i would expect even hundreds of inherited groups to be supported
the key prefix should either be not listable and not readable or listable and readble when using prefix policy
it signs the certificate with the requested lifespan
the host header of the http request should be vault consul example com as specified by the url typed by the user this would allow loadbalancers behind srv records to be able to route properly requests to their backend
i d expect to be able to see all entities no matter if they have or haven t logged in at least once
after removing the child group from parent group it should no longer be in the parent group
the token is successfully revoked
i expected vault to present the new cert
token should have been properly stored with a deprecation warning against the use of an old key or documentation should be updated accordingly
it is expected that if the token is valid for use on the cli or via api that it would also be valid for use with the ui
delete this alias
according to the doc we should get a 200 and the following response json options cas 0 data foo bar
aws credentials are generated
aliases should get loaded properly
the ui should redirect to the first auth method with list method when unauthenticated option
vault logs error 503 backend error instead of invalid request
the output says version version
vault always returns correct info about mounts including mount accessor
vault acknowledges that the account does not exist for example by checking the response the iam api gives and stops trying to remove the account or alternatively have a way that you can stop vault from trying to revoke accounts
it is expected that the vault process would pass the os environment including ld library path into the secondary plugin process so that it can find the client libraries outside of standard library paths
1 token is able able to list all resources in secret 2 token is not allowed to list the content of secret notvisible as the documentation url states that the more specific path takes precedence
i expect vault to either reject my json if it is not compatible or malformed or accept it without modification
the final command to create a token with policy root should fail as the approle only has policies bug and default
the s3 backend should work and also all the unit tests of s3 backend should pass
they should be filled with the correct data
the only vault services that should appear in the catalog are actual vault nodes
we expect to get a list of configured certificate names
ui login should work in new lowercase favorited ldap
expected path to be usable
if the data has been returned to the client it should be returned
i would expect vault to continue to function and respond to api requests without interruption in the event of losing an etcd unit
in plugin server set the max receive size to a value similar to or the same as the max send size which would align to the changes made for 4843 alternately allow both send and receive values to be configurable via plugin serveopts
the value of the boolvar flag should be correctly populated from the environment
i expected a 503 to be returned
all aliases are tied to the entity
the ability to specify my own configuration without having to use defaultconfig
v1 of the secret should be returned i m unable to check via cli as there s no example and i ve been unable to guess the format thus far in case there is one
token renew successfully
but it works fine via vault cli vault kv get secret foo metadata key value created time 2018 06 21t07 53 version z deletion time n a destroyed false version 1 data key value bar baz
the folders should be navigable just as if i had navigated to that path from the root secret path
all ok with deprecated postgres plugin vault secrets enable postgresql vault write postgresql config connection connection url postgresql amet ametamet vault test url rds amazonaws com 5432 postgres vault write postgresql config lease lease 1h lease max 24h write roles readonly sql create role name with login password password valid until expiration grant select on all tables in schema public to name read creds readonly key value lease id creds readonly 46f3aa11 dc8c 6144 7f97 duration 1h renewable true password 13dbcbc7 e99a 7222 2830 f93bee1b6fdd username root 8fb5f459 51ce 98d5 0071
to get the same options as when auth method was enabled if the values of the stored fields cannot be retrieved then the fields should be displayed with contents of unable to retrieve or similar
the documentation should
i expect vault to shut down
i should receive the original secret
should be checked as on chrome
i can make it work if i run vault kv get wrap ttl 10m secret data foo note that i inserted data prefix in the path then vault unwrap returns valid data console vault unwrap format json 4b19a5b0 8ea4 e502 9580 request id a4bf21e0 6ec1 90ec 3379 lease id lease duration 0 renewable false data password bar user foo metadata created time 2018 06 06t21 21 version z deletion time destroyed false version 2 warnings null i would expect vault kv get wrap ttl 10m secret foo work as before like kv 1 to keep it consistent with other kv command
see the actual error which in our case was a permission error
vault ssh should respect the users ssh config and not append default values which should be handled by the ssh client the o userknownhostsfile flag should only be appended to the ssh command if user known hosts file has been set from a technical point of view this would mean removing default value for user known hosts file and only appending it when flaguserknownhostsfile
it returns the correct entries
tidy should never delete unexpired certificates
operations running without the delay
i did not expect the following capabilities to required in my policy path sys internal ui mounts capabilities read
the mysql user should be of less than 16 char or there should be other way to specify the number of character
data key value test test
1 default is key type any 2 if not default at least setting it should be possible
successfully load the pretrained model
should produce a robertatokenizer instance which can also be used for distilroberta base
evaluation should run fine
passing in past should not throw an error and should speed up generation
pretrained weights should load just fine
the speed probably should stay the same
the expectation is that sep is output from the decode function
i did not expect this behavior to require pytorch
training to complete without error
while using language model finetuning for roberta base i got an error cublas runtime error resource allocation failed at pytorch aten src thc thcgeneral cpp 216 when i checked the tokenized dataset i observed that it had 514 tokens i e 512 coming from max len single sentence plus 2 special tokens roberta tokenizer should have max len single sentence set to 510 just like the one in bert max len single sentence max len 2
decode method of the tokenizer should return a string and not a list
get a tokenizer object
i expect the decoder to return the string special token
i expect new tokenizer to initialize a tokenizer with the same behavior as pretrained tokenizer
not give the error and work like it is supposed to
text generation like using gpt2 as model name or path
at evaluation time the tokenizer should also be cased but because it s loading from a path and not using a model name the from pretrained method in berttokenizer fails to identify casing information and the basictokenizer defaults to uncased do lower case true
expected to get eval results and for the script to exit with 0
be able to pass null to component without breaking it
the expected behavior here is that the images ought to have display after build and the images location in the apk should be something like www build assets imgs mandara jpg
when the user uses the browser back button and navigation occurs the modal should be dismissed
the searchbar should get focus immediately after calling focus and the keyboard should be displayed
as soon as dropdown backdrop is clicked without any option selected it should dismiss dropdown and change control states without requiring an additional click
first tab is actived and when click on each item they will be actived
the label should stay on top when the input is invalid
when navigating to a page with navigateroot this navcontroller navigateroot path to page i would not expect to see the back button since there should be no pages in the history stack to go back nb clicking the back button does not navigate away from the page so this is as expected since current page is now root
normally no zoom in and out of pictures
i would expect that angular change detection is run when mutating the data and the view is updated
unnecessary change detection should not run while each ionic component s element are created
keep focus so a user can keep on typing in the same field they were just typing in
targeting target es2015 in tsconfig json is safe when the app needs to run on browsers that only support es2015

the component should be able to read its
ion content with fullscreen attribute will behave like ion content without the attribute with ion title and buttons fading sliding smoothly
can set property animated of ionrouteroutlet to false
i expect the text inside the label to not wrap
for the button to be disabled and the visible effect of the button to indicate it is disabled
you should not be able to swipe back from a page where a candeactivate guard returns false
app scrolls content and or doesn t freeze
datetime picker should be set to 0 instead of current time when value is 0
ideally the data should flow back to activatedroute data and i should get the new resolved data when the page reloads it works fine in a pure angular project

in md mode the default spinner icon should be
navigation back and forth between sibling routes should always succeed
the animation should be smoother on coming back to home page
when you block the possibility to leave a page on ionviewwillleave with a candeactivateguard and a user swipes to go back the page transition should not have started because then the user is still able to swipe away the page
it should trigger the ion select on tap and opens a modal for selecting items
title block pushes up the container if it needs more space ion actionsheet 2 url
there should be no box appearing
this style should not be there or it should not use important it may be seen as a breaking change to remove it but i d argue it is a fix to a problem because interferes with the native functionality of the attribute up for discussion
testing with jest is an important part of any react project and it would be useful if either this just worked or there was a documented method to work around this problem particularly with create react app which obviously has limitations on the configuration
list update shouldn t change the way sliding option works
mixin is applied in production
i expect placeholder text and floating labels to live side by side in perfect harmony
both single and dual knob renderings should update the knobs and emit ionchange when the bound variable is changed see attached animated gif notice that changes to both single and dual sliders results in logged data clicking on the single slider buttons logs twice once from the button click and once from onchange event clicking on dual buttons only generates a single log entry from button click code ionic4 range bug url

lt ion content which fit to lt ion header placed globally on tabs page as it is fitting to lt ion tabs

the ion cols should not have padding like mentioned in the documentation and was before in ionic 3
when focussing the second ion input i expect the view to scroll to a position where the ion input is centered in the view
my custom styles should be applied with view encapsulation active this comment makes me think that it used to work url issuecomment
i have a page in a tab which is an editor for a new item where additional data is provided via queryparams which can be called from other pages in other tabs via navigate i ought to be able to call that route multiple times with different queryparams and the editor ought to display for that tab with the appropriate modifications based off the incoming queryparams via it s activatedroute events

android version is works well
i ve been testing ionic 3 apps and this problem doesn t exist only on ionic 4 with capacitor and cordova is this intentional if so is there a way to disable this having to double click the tab icon to navigate each time you have just scrolled content is annoying and unusable
cleaner www sources with only the js and all the assets packaged in assets whatever
for these lifecycle events to fire
setting the serviceworker field to false or removing it in angular json should then not include the service worker in cordova builds ideally would be nice if the cli handles this automatically based on if a pwa or cordova build is being made so we don t even had to switch a boolean between builds

ion inputs should be emptied when their model is undefined
it should not be an error

we can use the browser platform on firefox and on chrome with ublock
app should build properly with typescript strict option enabled
it should update itself
expect to be able to add unlimited color keys to color map or at least a very large number
building for production should result in the application build working even more performant than in development
label should stay on top as there are values inserted into the input field
the ionic page with form fields to be at the least as fast the browser or in app browser
swiping direction should be reversed in rtl
it should correctly register the menu

the app must run without native issues on the devices above
the expected behavior is to have the option to have the content of tabs pages loaded before the user visits them for first time document queryselectorall scroll content 0 is defined document queryselectorall scroll content 1
disabled should only disable the ion input it is assigned to and not keyup events on parent ion content
because the component is disabled i would expect the component to not respond at all
the ionchange event should be fired when using the keyboard as well
the toolbar should always use env safe area inset top regardless of the statusbarpadding value so it would avoid the statusbar and notch
appear only 1 tab button

wanted introduce a callback option to an input alert input another option could be for alert inputs only to have a button act as default

tabs should always be aligned to the bottom
it should update the value and show the pin if it is set to true
should be able to scroll back and forth in the input value
the position and width slide will change after move the device orientation other user sorry i did not find the user posted this code let event document createevent htmlevents event initevent resize true false window dispatchevent event but it works the first time then it does not work
actionsheet does not display scrollbars
the modal should close when the user presses the back button
don t fall the conversion candidate window

it should navigate to another page as happens with other components in same app
dev build starts without error missing files
switching to the next field or submitting form if this was the last one no action would also be preferable

from my point of view the page is fully entered when it is fully visible if you cannot avoid intense calculations while entering a page it would be much more user friendly to show the page without fully loaded infos than to block the whole navigation by keeping sidebar open my proposal request is to not start ionviewdidenter until the menu is closed problems with this rather simple approach may occur when using split pane mode url
the ionic serve command should reload the app with the new changes applied to the code however it stops working

that you can setup a slides component that can be swiped horizontally and it s inner slide component content can be slid vertically
the bullets should not be clickable unless paginationclickable is true the paginationclickable option is false by default so they should not be clickable by default i would not mind if the default was paginationclickable true as long as setting it to false worked
although such behavior is not to be recommended sometimes it is needed to place the ion refresher inside a component for example on my case i have 3 lists which are identical in look and behavior but with different content every time so my list component should have virtual scrolling refresher infinite scroll etc in that one component

changing the content of the ngmodel regardless of where should update the ion select as happens when the multiple option is not used
push a page from a modal page with this nav push notificationspage and page has normal header with the ios statusbar not mixing with the ionic header

when iondrag event fired is should update object and title should change in the html
when the new slider page is opened it should be controllable
resolve the promise should close the current page and go back to the previous
the open could return the overlay object viewcontroller which is presenting the alert or the object may be made public in class rather than just be accessible only in open function locally
virtualscroll works without runtime error
when ionviewcanleave returns false and navctrl pop is called internally by the framework when pressing the device back button a catch should be made internally on the pop call to prevent this uncaught promise exception

it should just say back
proper margin on ios
some error indication about no form control with given name would be nice i can even post pull request myself i guess this is easy fix just need some hint where the problem might be
ion label inside ion item should work so we can put chips inside ion item
the elements in the customized component should be styled as if the customized component doesn t exist
i expect letting go of the refresher would return to state inactive progress 0

simply show the version or give a command that works
for the ion content to be re rendered beneath the ion searchbar when it is toggled to show after being hidden and for the ion content to be pushed down to accommodate the expanded ion header
it should accept float numbers not only integers
it should be working the same way as when compiling jit even better
when i m on the customerdetaildeeppage i expect to have the defaulthistory add to the navigation array as i mentionned it ot the deeplinkconfig furthemore i shouldn t see tabs due to tabshideonsubpages option set in ion tab
the page should refresh with the current activate page
new posts would be added to the document without me jumping down and triggering the infinite scrolling again

i would expect to be navigated to mypage
if text will not be hardcoded will be easy to change language for app
calling getactiveindex on an ion slides element should always produce a 0 based index regardless of whether it loops or not

get the current component name inside tab userpage
1 only those items of virtualscroll must be rendered that are in visible range 2 any items of virtualscroll outside visible range must not be rendered usually first element of array is always rendered
the shadow is always visible in the sliding process
the image height should be seen the width reduced to fit in the available space without loosing aspect ratio
ideally i could decide in code whether the click should result in checked or disabled state ion checkbox checked selected disabled hidden click select event preventdefault ion checkbox
ios should function as android does ios should not fire both a click and a press event from a long press
the app should send a request with some json ified data to the parse server and return some data in the success promise so the user gets validated it enters via error promise tho
each tab to be rendered only when it s active
i would expect the aria label attribute to propagate to the tab s button or by default the tab button should use the tabtitle attribute for default aria label on button
normal navigation occurs

instant swapping of screens no white flicker

a normal focus of an input
the swiper need to initialize every time it s called
could be nice to use virtualscroll inside another loop
after opening the sidemenu able to directly click a link
don t crash exit
to be able to use the hardware keyboard and type without the ion input losing focus
the catch of the android back button should be handled by the framework too since its default behavior is the same as ion navbar back button
if we tap the back button area of nav bar quickly on screen 3 2 and 1 it should unload screen 3 and 2 and load screen 4
ion icon text outline should display for both
the input should remain populated in password fields when changing focus just like type text
text fields inside an iframe should behave as they do in a mobile web browser the user should be able to drag the cursor and select delete text and then be able to continue typing in the text field

it should smoothly push the content up i was looking at apps on the market place and in their demos the keyboard scrolls smoothly not sure what i am doing wrong
i expect that i can define default button which invoked on hardware keyboard enter press
the bouncing should be smooth just like on lists that do not contain inputs
properly alligned as like in iphone
this needs to work more like a native app the prompt to appear in the center of the screen when the software keyboard opens up alert needs to slide into correct position near top of screen
normal input behavior
tapping the hardware back button while an actionsheet is currently visible would dismiss the actionsheet
the button should not get an hover effect or the effect should be a different color as the navigation bar
it should render the columns or provide a warning that year must be passed to displayformat pickerformat when providing min and max years for the picker this would also require an update to the documentation
pages should always respond to taps and swipes normally
should be able to drag the range to every possible value

promise rejection
a loading component with dismissonpagechange true should also be closed when a modal is dismissed
developers often update application without changing libraries having production bundle split in 2 for example libraries js app js would allow speedup deployment as most of the time developers can upload just changed app js part for example when deploy to google appengine just changed files are uploaded on 2g connection few extra mb do make a difference minimize traffic response time for clients for requests after an app updated an additional 1 http s request should not be a big deal and not a problem at all those who use http2 you should of course a proper lazy loading with multiple modules would be more generic and preferable solution but splitting into 2 bundles can be good interim or settings free by default alternative

https connections should keep working as normal i
changing istio configmap should invoke new pilot s deployment

on a full cluster restart the istio control plane should be able to successfully recover itself back to functionality
i have single gateway and two virtual services two services are sending to ingress gateway but with different hostname but traffic is routed to same service for both
since there is no such limitation on domain name istio should be able to create them
no dropped connections when adding new pods with their virtual service
it is in contravention to the documentation as below url note for kubernetes users when short names are used e g eviews instead of eviews default svc cluster local istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule not service a rule in efault namespace containing a host eviews will be interpreted as eviews default svc cluster local irrespective of actual namespace associated with reviews service to avoid potential misconfigurations it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names
requests to mycompany io should be routed via the gateway specified in the meshnetworks settings when the resolved ip matches the given cidr block

if there is metadata being collected it should be accurate we probably also should not have two different ways of reporting the same information
serviceentry telemetry is being reported e g time serie for istio tcp sent bytes total destination service edition cnn com is updated
1 the code reflects the yaml configuration set by user not silently overriding it 2 validation for the case where a single weight destination is either 0 or just 100 is added so users know their setup is incorrect which is the reason why it overriden in first place
apply service entry to external service say url then apply a fault injection virtual service after that is done when curling from inside a sidecar injected pod expect to see the specified fault say a 500 response
istioctl proxy config to work
citadel should retrieve an object s namespace and inspect its labels to determine whether or not a namespace should be istio managed

bookinfo exposed through ingress gateway works
pilot agent should still start like it did in version
kubectl apply applies the configuration delta leaving the configured istio sidecar injector webhook as is
i would expect not to see any data for istio tcp sent bytes total destination service name www apple com perhaps data to istio tcp sent bytes total destination service name en wikipedia org or no data at all because en wikipedia org is not a serviceentry
pilot never polls the kubernetes api to load the configmap but only reads the meshconfig from a file
when is included in alloworigin send a vary header with a value that includes origin

rejected envoy config should be at least warning level all the logs output by pilot which need some fix has to be warn or error level
limits should be less than requests
test cases pass
if mixer policy enabled false the resulting helm charts should not contain policy service deployments etc
istio version is consistently marked as a version higher than previously released
globally exported destination rules that match a host based on wildcards would have their configuration propagated to envoy sidecars based on the most specific wildcard matching e g namespace svc cluster local has precedence over local
proxy status and authn tls check should function for istioctl
using labels with slashes for subsets should be allowed
yaml file having no conflict
useful data in the spans it appears it s using the attributes request size and response size which extract their data from the content length unfortunately much of the data is chunked so rarely gives useful data it seems request response total size may work but this would also include headers and trailers in addition to body although this may be preferred
an artifact exists to install cni
bookinfos can be ran under consul
the service can be accessed normally during the upgrade
when configuring the poddnsconfig for certmanager the resulting dnsconfig field should be indented properly

ideally error messages in prometheus metrics would be an enum or a short bounded string we can get the full error messages from logs
i d expect it to come up and shine all the time
chart versions are bumped for at least the chart app version should probably be used properly or removed as well
tests should pass for all golang version builds
if there are pilot total xds internal errors pilot rds expired nonce then we should see some error or warning logs in pilot pods
one misconfiguration should not impact existing networking behavior
i expect the sidecar injector to manage it s cabundle appropriately
the locality based routing feature of serviceentry needs to support dns resolution so that a service can specify its external endpoint as an fqdn that gets resolved to its available ip addresses automatically
no secret content should be logged ever log level should be configurable through the helm chart default level should be info or higher
kubectl exec ti kubectl get po l istio ingressgateway n istio system o jsonpath items 0 metadata name n istio system curl version 15000 certs certificate data

istio ingressgateway pods to get to ready state upon installation
getting the real proxy status of the pod
the validating admission controller should prevent this manifest from being applied
if we give ability to configure url for grafana it should work i am ready to crerate pr with fix but we should agree on the way how we want to fix this e g just add this additional property allow user to override full configmap gives ability for user make all available configurations for kiali

google cloud storage uri should not 404 the istio io istio init chart should be available for download
the requests are routed to a single backend consistently based on the hashed source ip see istioctl proxy config endpoints client pod o json cluster outbound 9090 destinationservicestring with three backends the endpoint configuration returned three hosts of equal weight also through testing i have witness the requests be round robin routed instead of consistently routed
it should use ipv6 localhost instead i think we can reuse fuction in cluster go
return allow any registry only 200 502
all istio labeled components should show up with their status and metrics
i created a kind envoyfilter and able to route the traffic to external auth service however my kubernetes readiness check endpoint health shouldn t be routed to this external auth service that should be passing without authorization

check requests should be sent to istio policy and be handled according to mixer s config
assuming the following gateway configuration apiversion networking istio io v1alpha3 kind gateway metadata name kyma gateway namespace kyma system spec selector istio ingressgateway servers hosts kyma local port name https number 443 protocol https tls mode simple privatekey etc istio ingressgateway certs tls key servercertificate etc istio ingressgateway certs tls crt hosts kyma local port name http number 80 protocol http tls httpsredirect true netstat should return active internet connections only servers proto recv q send q local address foreign address state pid program name tcp 0 0 version 80 version listen 20 envoy tcp 0 0 version 15090 version listen 20 envoy tcp 15000 listen 20 envoy tcp 443 listen 20 envoy tcp6 15020 1 pilot agent however in some corner case the entries for 80 and 443 are missing causing connection refused errors example url

connect to redis successfully by using serviceentry
when global sds enabled false it should not matter what the values of the following values are yaml sds sds enabled if set to true mtls certificates for the sidecars will be distributed through the secretdiscoveryservice instead of using k8s secrets to mount certificates enabled false udspath unix var run sds uds path usetrustworthyjwt false usenormaljwt false
the address would resolve to the ip address we ve verified that from the pilot discovery container host can resolve the hostname we re trying to use if there is an error in url l258 i would expect it to be printed somewhere in logs so we re able to debug instead of it silently failing indeed if it fails resolve these addresses due some temporary network issue during startup that s going cause serious problems with mesh it might be better simply crash out if given invalid config rather than starting up and breaking all cross cluster traffic
build should not break
the same configuration was working in istio version it is not working in istio version as a workaround i am using the following configuration apiversion networking istio io v1alpha3 kind destinationrule metadata name default spec host default svc cluster local trafficpolicy tls mode istio mutual

i can reach another namespace istio not enabled service through test but can t reach services running on default
wget success get data from url
i figure resetform in an onsubmit is roughly like enablereinitialize but obviously semantically different for my case initialvalues do change from the parent after submission but those should be ignored after first render
all format which doesn t include in my supported formats array should be rejected by the validation
formik should only validate fields inside tags
field marked as touched and error shows
the field is included with an empty value
the code should compile successfully with the supplied react element assigned to formik errors name
field s and fastfield s render props should also contain any other props passed to field in all implementations even when used via render or children props
to have a touched object shape to only contain fields with booleans as values just like it did pre version

svg element will include the class myclass
as the user moves the mouse over the polygons it smoothly highlights them by changing fillopacity without any lag this is the behavior in leaflet version
i expect no javascript error there is no error with leaflet version
developing some feature with custom shape i want events bubble correctly it s obvious that leaflet need more info about my shape but having some documented way to provide such info for custom features would be definitely better than silent assumptions
expected behavior map shouldn t freeze when the map is not loaded in an iframe but directly in the browser like here url the map won t freeze on a samsung galaxy
not setting the opacity when the icon is null
the default attribution link should link to https not http or their should be at least an easy way to set it to https when creating a new map

controls stay visible as they do with other earlier browsers
the screen reader should have some way of interacting with the map data there s no perfect way i know of to do this but a few models come to mind that s another discussion though
the map displays no tiles are loaded because the map s zoom 5 is outside the minzoom maxzoom range 16 18 the performance is excellent because there are no tiles to load at this zoom level
an alert should be displayed via the mouseover event handler
radio buttons on other maps are not affected
a boolean result

i expect it to save
to properly load place and resize new question cards to dashboards
i d expect the date granularity to change
probably would prefer things to be like the other custom queries where just the example database name would be shown
the x axis should reflect the ordering changes in the filter configuration
the long question names should be truncated or wrapped into multiple lines therefore the vertical scrolling would be applied to the right grey column only and no horizontal scrollbar would be visible
the questions should not have static information on the schema name saved but query the database connection for the current schema name
the downloaded data should contain data from both questions each in its own column
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
we will see two lines however for each date is visualized only one point

ideally one of the following should happen after clicking on one of the download formats 1 disable the download menu and show a loading icon instead 2 close the menu altogether and show loading for entire dashboard
all questions should show results
migrate the data from h2 to mysql
when hovering over any data point on the dashboard the tool tip should appear and display the date and the measure value in example below we use date function that returns a date instead of date format that returns a string then tool tip shows up properly bildschirmfoto 2019 09 23 um 11 06 10 url

the two dates should match
members should remain members of a metabase group as long as they are still members in the ldap group
i expected to see the symbol r when i select currency
i expected the pulse image after the upgrade to look like it used to before the upgrade

since the initial table tells me there are 2 records at the 4 pm time slot i would expect to be able to see 2 records
the collection of the question has moved

should behave like the filter sidebar which uses the aliased table name
raw data in table format is returned in both scenarios
the list of field from jointable should be included in the list for user to select in the custom expression

would include all data through the last day of the prior month
the y range adheres to the manually set values
i d expect that whatever formats i choose for the columns in the table would also apply to exported versions of that table

it shall be possible to bin the results so grid map can be used even better if it would work for native sql as well
the world map should render in a reasonable amount of time 5 seconds imho and should not freeze the whole ui
expected result something inline with the below selection 01 url
i d like to be able to use my counter field in custom expressions
i expected it to continue to accept our valid internal fqdn for a server i think it s probably doing some lookup on what are valid internet tld values but as we can and are encouraged to self host metabase i think we should be able to use any valid host name
one result per matching question
just fresh the ui without clicking a button smiley
first of all i think the whole syncing should not terminate if one table fails to sync it should still be tried for the other tables in addition to that metabase should be able to also scan tables with spatial data
all rows should be exported
it should return a password sucessfully changed message or something
whatever underlying process it is indicating is loading should finish and the spinning indicator should dissappear
cards should load
i would expect to see my five collections
checkbox for current period remains checked until unchecked by the user
new users should be able to log into the application correctly
the expectation is that these tables can be joined to see columns from both tables under the circumstances that foo is distinct and non empty
results of the successful query should display
dashboard should consistently show all the questions properly
include today checkbox remains checked upon save
successful deployment
the full length of the left div pane should be white
expected behavior would be for there to be an input field where you can specify which goal you are looking for or else instead of having one single goal xx completions metric to have one for each configured goal bonus if metabase pulled in the goal s name for convenience but number would be better than nothing
the window should simply disappear
the new tabs should be visible

font used for startup does not matter
as if the delay wasn t there this should attempt to enable dec private mode 1234 which is unsupported by wt actually undefined so no action should be taken
two linefeeds eventually nothing more osc 10 sets the default foreground it s not yet supported by wt you can replace it with any other number that s not yet supported the terminating sequence of osc should be st accoding to the standard bel is a commonly used but nonstandard choice instead st in the c0 set is esc followed by now we insert a bit of delay in middle of st such difference in timing should never make a difference in final outcome not even when sequence is unsupported
it should display powershell existing key binding basic editing functions enter acceptline accept the input or move to the next line if input is missing a closing token shift enter addline move the cursor to the next line without attempting to execute input backspace backwarddeletechar delete character before cursor ctrl h backwarddeletechar delete character before cursor ctrl home backwarddeleteline delete text from cursor to start of line ctrl backspace backwardkillword move text from start of current or previous word th ctrl c copy copy selected region system clipboard if no region is selected copy th c copyorcancelline either copy selected text clipboard or if no text is selected cancel ed x cut delete region placing deleted in system clipboard
the entire line should be underlined
the profiles are deleted
for this issue we expect to accomplish the space of single tab layout by multiple tabs example 1 microsoft edge browser for multiple opened tabs microsoft edge browser provides scroll tab list forward and scroll tab list backward options to scroll over all the tabs and indicates the presence of multiple tabs terminal3 url example 2 google chrome browser for multiple opened google chrome browser squeeze all the opened in single tab layout terminal4 url

quoting from the dec std 070 manual if the active position is at or below the top margin when the cuu control is executed and an attempt is made to move active position above top margin control will be executed until active position reaches top margin active position will not move beyond top margin similarly for cud command if is at or above bottom when cud control executed and an attempt made to move below bottom control will be executed until reaches bottom will not move beyond bottom so i would expect cuu sequence to stop on line 6 and cub sequence to stop on line 19 this what output looks like in xterm image url
i can t find spec text to back this up but in both xterm and the gnome vte terminal these commands are constrained by the decstbm margins so cnl doesn t move below row 19 the bottom margin and cpl doesn t move above row 6 the top margin this is what output looks like in xterm image url

any process that is started continues running
i d expect the to behave exactly as specified in the documentation url so the viewport content should be moved down by 4 lines but only altering the area within cliprect i wouldn t expect decstbm margins to have any affect on this operation essentially output should look like this image url
the line feeds should not cause the viewport to scroll when below the bottom margin so the bottom line text should remain on last line of screen this is what above test case looks like in xterm image url and here s an extract from dec std 070 documentation for lf control explaining that behavior if active position is below bottom margin when this control is executed as result of absolute cursor positioning it will still move downward by one line and no scrolling will occur in this case active position will not move beyond bottom of display

according to the vt510 reference url this should erase the lines with all visual character attributes cleared the dec std 070 manual says the same sort of thing empty character imaged as space empty rendition and empty character attribute rendition refers to attributes like underline reverse video etc so when clearing screen i would expect underline and reverse attributes not to be applied so it should just fill screen with red background color dec s vt terminals never had color but that s a requirement of background color erase url bce mismatches feature this is what result looks like in xterm image url
in the first case i d expect to see the first line indented by 5 characters in the second case i d expect to see 5 characters deleted from the first line this is how those commands look in xterm image url

the new cursor shape should continue to work in the terminal and stay ticked in properties
the cursor from the previous line should dissappear after you hit enter
all foreground text should be white

expected returns both dates from the array result returns an empty array
action console log end of 03 week moment yyyy w ww week result
moment should consistently account for leap years when calculating day differences
the expected date object should have been sun dec 01 2019 00 00 00 gmt 0530 india standard time
in word should not appear as documented in the docs url displaying to eg 5 days ago
should correctly output the isostring value
i would expect to get 1 second
time indicated on both websites should be the same in seconds
all tests passing
the expectation would be to invalidate the date as overflowing
for two different date diff durations i expect to get a different number of days i expect one to be 10 days
should return false always
the value should be 1 code var ad moment 3 10 2019 mm dd yyyy if ad isvalid var ds moment 3 11 2019 mm dd yyyy if ds isvalid console write moment duration ds diff ad asdays expected 1 actual version
its should show false and date should not create because its not a valid format
the code should always print true
instead this should behave exactly the same as using day 0 date 0 or date 0 where it is flagged as an invalid date js var momentusingdaykey moment day 0 month 2 year 1990 format invalid date
console log date format yyyy mm dd 2000 02 29
since we define an interval with a constant length in days simply based on a different starting day we would expect the length in years to be constant in that case 1005 days so version years considering 365 days in a year
my output to be in dd mm yyyy format which for the current value is 01 15 1989
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen i expect that the daylight savings check to work in docker
it should return difference as 2 hrs
it should return suffixes ex for value 15 15inci
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
it should ve produced date 2019 03 06t13 08 24 05 30 because that s 7 days from 2019 02 27t13 08 24 05 30 i m using google chrome on imac don t know if that s helpful moment version moment version please run the following code in your environment and include the output console log new date tostring thu feb 28 2019 14 08 05 gmt 0530 india standard time console log new date tolocalestring 2 28 2019 2 08 18 pm console log new date gettimezoneoffset 330 console log navigator useragent mozilla version macintosh intel mac os x 10 13 6 applewebkit version khtml like gecko chrome safari moment
the resulting timestamp is different
the moment should be acting just like the string when converted into a date
must return 1 but it returns 0
i would expect p64d to be interpreted as 2 months 4 days as one can disagree on the length of a month or year in terms of days a configuration option with good default is expected
i would expect the date to be the same since the moment object keeps the information or at least get day right
moment duration should always return a duration object
yarn run webpack p should work without any error
moment should correctly display the next day 2018 03 25
i expect the first date to be a valid
i think it would be more correct if the library return 2019 01 when operating on 2018 12 31 in this case it currently returns 2018 01 which is not correct it rolls the week over from 52 to 1 but does not roll the year in same way
1 23 march 2018 moment 2018 03 23 format dd returns 23 2 29 march 2019 moment 2019 03 29 format dd returns 29 3 27 march 2020 moment 2020 03 27 format dd returns 27
for the date to be valid and near the original date
honestly i m not sure i don t think the week number should change before the year has changed changing the year beforehand would be unexpected behavior on itself so i think the solution should be to allow for week 53 to exist in these cases
we expect the correct date to be generated by moment i e for a given week in 2018 a 2018 date is generated not a 2019 date
i expect it to replace the one item in the locale configuration and set the locale without reverting to en us locale
it should return correct datetime with timezone

a result of false on failure to apply
expected archive size to be settable or modifiable or for some override mechanism forcing types to use generic clib 64 to properly set pointer sizes to 64 bit note through the ghidra api local remote file and local project archives can have their pointer size s modified however an extended search for a similar operation on remote project archives did not appear fruitful though that definitely does not rule such a mechanism out entirely

given a literal with a bunch of leading zeroes could keep bumping the precision until at least one non zero digit shows up and then add 2 3 extra digits after that as another approach to the problem in one of the past projects i pre generated a float literal bytes c literal value lookup table for a number of b combinations that produce literals that require 7 fractional digits to represent as well as pi b and common bit based ones 1 1 1 1 which allowed to output easier to read literals 3 7 vs version in common scenarios
the decompiler is supposed to send getexternalrefxml to get the function details for the external referenced function it does this consistently on 32 and 64 bit windows modules
the decompiler should return the cs register after a far call to the value prior to the call which is current cs ip pair of code being scanned program counter in this case is really pair cs ip and not merely ip which is part of problem due to thoroughness of architecture i have not yet pinpointed exactly how to fix this problem currently stack pointer is properly adjusted and fix should be in same place of scanning post call with a properly adjusted stack pointer by properly adjusting code segment register as well from my understanding model a call fixup or some sleigh code supposed be queried by decompiler which will for most part just restore cs and sp registers yet this not occurring
the symbol without the section name prefix should be set as primary
working analysis
e rlwinm r11 r0 0x2 0x0 0x1d should result in the operation r11 r0 2 0xfffffff0 in my code this is used to calculate offsets into a jump table and the address at that offset is used for a se bctr instruction later on ie branching to the address in the jump table instead 2 never happens and offsets are all wrong in decompiler

i expect selected2 to be the same as selected1 but the result does not seem so we can see that the indexing array is both boolean for selected1 and selected2 so is it better to get same indexing result
it should just return completed
for cases such as the one above would expect the restart to occur at the 8th iteration epoch index 7 above but instead occurs at the 9th iteration epoch index 8 above this is probably due to resetting of last epoch in init since it resets last epoch to initial user given parameter value despite fact that call to super init sets it user given parameter value 1

either a python exception should be raised or it should be a no op
either clarification in the docs and in the code that indices tensor has to have the same backend as source tensor or fixing the runtimeerror in case we want to disable indexing with a different backend it would make sense to disable it for forward indexing operation too right now forward would be fine but backward will through a runtime error
in torch version the time it took is 5ms aside from the 1st iteration and 25ms when setting non blocking false as of torch version up to nightly the time is 25ms regardless of the non blocking being true

expected to build and link fine
i think that it is expected that no matter which of the three ways i described to do the in place modification of the tensor a should have been modified while it is not if i use a single mask then everything works just fine if i try something else such as a 0 0 17 or a 0 0 17 then everything is working but notice that the slicing is not done with mask or torch unit8 tensor in these two cases one way to work around this issue using another tensor k b print k k k c 42 as been modified print b has been modified print print b b
the output of m a should not be nan s since the default eps is 1e 12
if dtype of b is torch uint8 it works normally like tensor 9 5 3 1 3 9 tensor 1 0 1 dtype torch uint8 tensor 0 5 0 1 3 9 if i change dtype to torch int64 it woks differently like tensor 3 9 8 7 7 0 8 7 7 it seems that the value of slices act as slices instead of the position of no zero elements
at least we should have consistant values of the two right in the old version version if we follow the previous convention putting the lr scheduler step at beginning of each iteration output values are reasonable and consistant code python version import torch net torch nn conv2d 1 1 1 optimizer torch optim sgd net parameters lr version lr scheduler torch optim lr scheduler exponentiallr optimizer gamma for i in range 5 scheduler step print i get optimizer param groups 0 output 0 1 2 3 4

the plan cache should be context aware and add a new plan to the cache for the cuda context associated with the 2nd gpu you can simulate this by setting python torch backends cuda cufft plan cache max size 0 before for loop to verify that cache is at fault alternatively separate caches could be maintained for each context not sure if that s easier or not
i expect there to be a way to generate non nan gradients for weight norm weights that are zero filled
it should raise a correct error
gpu utilization for all present gpus should rise simultaneously whereas indenting the last line so it runs inside the for loop should cause gpu utilization to rise and fall on one device at a time the loop above should run about n gpus times faster than if the last line were indented instead gpu utilization rises and falls sequentially and loop takes same amount of time to run if synchronization happens in for loop or not

sane behavior would be to use either the arch from pytorch compilation because if you can use pytorch it seems to work reasonably well or one that fits the gpus in particular with inline either would be an improvement over the current behvious
the memory usage should be relatively the same in the first pass through the training loop and all following loops
the results should be the same on repeated evaluation

no deadlock running the above script with pytorch jit 0 python3 deadlock bug py works and prints creating scriptmodule done without deadlock ran scriptmodule however with pytorch jit 1 it never reaches the done part and needs to be sigstop d i don t quite understand the backtrace or why this would happen given that there s only two threads one of which wants to join the other creating module in main thread works but that doesn t work as a workaround in situation i d like to use torchscript in incidentally if instead of creating a torch jit scriptmodule one just calls a torch jit script annotated function from thread everything works

the result should be reproducible threads running different module instances should not interfere with each other
we expect that the function new tensor will produce always the same new tensor every time i run the script there are thousands of different elements between the two tensors and output is not even consistent between different runs i found three interesting points on fact that two different tensors are produced it only happens on gpu if we create a new tensor inside new tensor instead of assigning same it does not happen if we change number of elements or s shape it could not happen but i did not find a correlation between different shapes given these observations it seems a memory problem
torch argmax returns the same value for tensors that have same data in it regardless of devices or other factors

the tensor should be correctly copied or an error message should be raised
perhaps it would be better if it didn t ever round to numbers more than 1 away might require adjusting the mantissa
pytorch to build
raise some python exception
on each iteration the output and index k should only depend on the the previous inputs those gradients should be non zero while all the other gradients should be 0 however for k 2 gradients for all 3 inputs are 0 even though first input should have a non zero gradient this fails autoregressive property even though masks are correct
global ops should contain valid doc s
i believe the expected behavior of the reduction sum and mean should be as consistent as the none option where i use numpy for reduction
all default values are specified as

passing the optional argument as a keyword argument should match the behavior when passing as a positional argument python x torch autograd variable torch tensor version requires grad true out my sin x factor 6 out backward print x grad 6 np cos version tensor version version this is useful for two reasons 1 it is consistent with standard python use and helps to avoid unexpected behavior 2 sometimes it is useful to use custom functions to wrap black box numpy functions which evaluate their value and their gradient and don t have a torch equivalent in a lot of cases these depend on keyword arguments and it would be nice to be able specify kwargs in the static forward method signature
expect same or better performance with torch version
that the performance is relatively consistent or predictable

import torch torch cuda is available returns true
f conv1d should behave the same way as nn conv1d f conv1d x w t unsqueeze 2 should be equal to f linear x permute 0 2 1 w t permute 0 2 1 or at least to f conv1d x w t clone unsqueeze 2 same for inverse and conv2d did not check for conv3d but probably it is broken too
torch load vgg16 from caffe pth should return state dict instead
i would expect that during eval mode batchnormalization is not enabled including dimension checks
i assume the second print statement should reference dimension 1 not 0
these functions should never construct dense tensors
the only workaround i found is to work with shared ptr of m but i think it would be nice if we could work with a stack allocated nn module

for the first case it should throw and error because the target index should range from 0 class but it doesn t for the second case the value of corresponding index should be consistently 0 or very small number but it seems not numerically stable at all if you have difficulty to reproduce output just run sript for two or three times if i need to manually mask out those invalid bit ignore index option is just confusing and should be removed i thought loss i got just be average or sum of those valid bits

it should compile
tab does not get rendered as a button
the carousel should navigate to previous slide on right swipe and next slide on left swipe

it should work as the react native slider without any problem
when i have typed something into a forminput field and then i click a button it should process the onpress function rather than closing the keyboard when i have typed something into a forminput field and then click the next forminput field it should move the cursor to that forminput field so i can continue typing not close keyboard and have my click again to open keyboard and type
when press cancel button the input should become empty it should print cancel when press clear button the input should become empty it should still focus on search bar it print clear
since i always throw an error i never want we finish as output
i would expect the function only to run when the condition is met
js the console output should be 4 5 6
i expect the bundle size to be only related to the number of operators i import in this case should be
for races won via completion or error the behavior should be like this code and subscriptions to subsequent source observables should not be made ts race defer console log subscribed to 1 return of 1 pipe delay 100 defer console log subscribed to 2 return of 2 defer console log subscribed to 3 return of 3 pipe delay 300 subscribe complete console log won error won with error will output subscribed 1 2 won
x content array still has original order
when using defer with a void factory the return type will be observable never
i expect event target to work event without element in dom
i expect for the put and post requests to be submitted open successful completion of the options request
i expect for the put and post requests to be submitted open successful completion of the options request image url
i d expect the behavior to be the same for the iterable version and the array version

map called 1 1 2 2 2 map called 2 1 3 3 map called 3 1 4 4
either one of not throwing when there are no pending actions throwing a clearer error e g attempting to flush an empty queue
function foo should be called with two different variants of value a 1 b 1 for the first time and a 2 b 2 for the second
if i understand correctly what the doc says the observable should be emiited after a duration duetime but not immediately
type is preserved after piping be it a subject behaviorsubject replaysubject etc
1 i click a button 2 clicked is printed in console as in this clear and obvious code const button document queryselector button button addeventlistener click console log clicked your examples here url first examples compare common code with rxjs version you claim we should expect the same result but common code works well
empty observables are emitted
the filter operator does not affect the type of the observable it is used on js type of filterednumber is observable number const filterednumber of 5 pipe filter num any true
the sharereplay operator should send all values to the subscriber that it received even if immediately sent synchronously the resulting log should be js value received is 1 value received is 2 value received is 3 value is 4 5
i would expect the application to compile with rxjs version when using the babel compiler
calling from with a promise that immediately resolves should generate an observable that emit s the promise s value
expect it to work and have the correction made for the missing semi colon
both tests with error and with timeouterror should display a stacktrace
they either should behave same way always or if they are designed to behave differently it needs to be clarified more
only 1 should be logged
no error happens and npm run info will list available scripts there are a lot lol as described in readme url buildingtesting
stream should go on to next tap
the observable should not emit until given period has passed
successful installation of rxjs in node modules
if there are no longer any subscribers the socket should be terminated as soon as it s finished connecting
the accumulator function should receive index parameter with ever increasing numbers for every emission from source like scan or mergemap do url l13 url l7
raising compilation error or supporting array observable t argument without spread operator would be better
umd rxjs file will only inject global variable rxjs to global window
hope can support in mobile browser
see commented out section in the same file url i would like to stop repeating depending on a specific status code of the response the solution with retrywhen works but feels like an unnecessary workaround
the above code should be passing however it infers observable observable string
the response should come through
should correctly output stream values
since testscheduler is a child of virtualtimescheduler and call super flush inside its own flush method i d expect it to be able to flush output for observables that uses asyncscheduler
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen or code
in prior from stream order 1 option value a order 2 option value a to order 1 option value a order 2 option value a i can then ngfor against the property subscribed to the stream
the observable to say it has thrown an error
in this case i think we would want to error the observable although it might also be useful to emit something to indicate it was aborted
errors have stack traces
problem exist when i want to dispatch relative to status 2 different actions typescript add type observable foo string observable bar string when manualy set type to observable foo string bar string it works fine
doing so should result in an error an infinite observable makes sense if the second parameter is null or undefined but defined nonnumerical values should be invalid inputs and throw errors
o2 should be of type observable number null
typing should not error
should be able to detect number
it should behave the same as observable pipe function and be able to compose static pipe functions separately and pass on to observable pipe
the observable constructor should accept an async subscribe function and calling observer complete should not throw an exception
it should work like it did in version
i would expect that any deferred observable running after unsubscription would not be run that is obtaining the following output from the previous code sh side effect 1 next 1 side effect 2 complete finalized no side effect 3 line as the item s emitted from those observables would never be used i don t see any advantage to running them moreover using something like an asapscheduler do not run the deferred observable
when using startwith inside of pipe i would expect either the argument type must match the observable s inner type the return type should be a union of the observable s inner type and argument
a cookie should always be sent when withcredentials is true
i would expect that the switchmap operator does work as before without the pipeable operators in rxjs version
js 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
adding a trailing coma to combinelatest and similar operators should not trigger the deprecated signature trailing coma is often a requirements in large companies to avoid merge conflicts due only to comas
i want to test the above code and i would expect that after i have gotten the expected output up to the point i have it then it would stop the test as a success with current test above test never finishes because guess timer never stops if uncomment take then passes
the source is passed through donotunsubscribe which should prevent it from ever being unsubscribed or at least it should prevent it from being unsubscribed from until the source finishes so i expect that either this test passes or a test with expsourcesub should pass i e never unsubscribe
because the default value is specified as using a string literal the inferred type is a literal type monotypeoperatorfunction d and that s not compatible with the source observable s type of observable string
should alert foo
find should unsubscribe from the source when it matches the first element it is not justified to hold the subscription as we know that no more elements from the source observable will be useful for us
for buffersize 0 there should be no buffer and if subscribed after an emit there should be no emit on the replaysubject
the expectation in the code above should be executed and the test should fail because z is not equal to q the test of y should be executed once while it is executed twice
based on my admittedly not enormously extensive javascript experience when a function expects an argument and is called without passing any to it the function behaves as if the argument was undefined the presence in the rxjs api of observable empty which very specifically covers case where completed is called without calling next only reinforces one s expectation that observable of will behave normally and differently from observable empty
an observable that never emits should be assignable to any observable of any type since the type doesn t matter if it never emits this is the semantic of never
when creating subject with direct subscription it receives piped values
tests should all pass in master branch and there is no error
when calling websocket next somedata it will send data over the websocket connection what s happening instead is it s sending nothing unless i call next on the original websocketsubject as soon as i pipe and lift is called i no longer am calling next on the correct observable with the queue of subscribers in it thus socket send msg in websocketsubject is never called i tried
the error function should be called providing the object they were found on for this
same behavior in other browsers
i expected the same behavior like in javascript the type file should be accept empty initial arguments evaluating as undefined in this case the subscriber should not notificated with the initial value
the output of pipe function should be a plain observable or expose a method asobservable
the beta docs indicate that if takeuntil s notifier never emits and then completes takeuntil is supposed to allow all values supplying takeuntil with never confirms this reading based on that understanding in the test1 example above takeuntil should have allowed an emission but at least allowed the expected completion in the test2 and test3 examples above should have allowed emissions and somehow didn t even allow completions in all three tests notifier for definitely completed before test observables were created my assumption is that all three test cases should have behaved identical to control case in which a single value was emitted followed by a completion this would not be first time i ve been bitten by some misunderstood nuance of hot observables but as far as i can tell hot observable is behaving exactly as i expect it to but is not
that the code works as expected i m not sure if this is a bug or a feature request thought
this should give a type error like number is not assignable to observableinput t
should subscribe since there is nothing stopping it from doing so
the error should be catched and handled by catcherror
it should always request when input changed i don t know is it working as expected
expect that pipe could infer the return type based on the operators
i would expect the observable symbol interop to be used before any other
the source code has error when using ide to inspect the error should not appear
i expect that tab will expand to gitcheckout feature ohmyzshissmart full name of branch

something more similar to a vanilla bash on ubuntu xxx hahahaha hahahaha command not found xxx
plugin should load without issue rather than parse errors
the cursor should remain on the same line

the same behavior
sh mingw64 nightly jq version jq version mingw64 bin jq n test halt error 1 expected output next line test
correct the doc like map and select
expected jq version output to appear in both cases
an error not an assert
for a popular software project like jq almost 14k stars on github i would expect there to probably be a docker image and low and behold there is a dockerfile in the code repo however there is no mention of a docker container image location in the readme file
jq would identify itself as source of error so above message would say jq parse error invalid numeric literal at line 1 column 18
the first line should raise a normal error not a null
failed test within appveyor will give a failure status for the tests instead of seemingly passing

storysource should show highlight lines in canvas view and show code in docs view regardless of how the story s title is made up
both the commented and uncommented version of the snippet should behave the same
build to run and resulting storybook to run
currently addon docs doesn t support showing source for jsx which is expected however it s still displaying a message no code available even with withsource none i would expect it to not attempt to load the source code at all and not display any message
i would expect the component to immediately reflect the context change
i would expect the icon to exist based on if the story uses the addon or not
all element of the component that is rendered inside the docs preview should be contained inside the preview
expect to alter story preview properly as stated on the doc moreover typeerror cannot read property kind of null should not appear
aligned to left
should run the test

expected behavior is that the snapshots contain components that are shallow rendered
that using a csp that does
working fast refresh while editing a story
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
the components should successfully show
should be able to change stories
performance should not be impacted by the fact that the iframe switches contents
it should have shown the stories on the browser
storybook uses the project s postcss config js
vue works as expected without an errors

once the graph is built and the batch size is constant the memory usage of the model should stay same so that there is no out of memory error upcoming during training process
keras should match up targets with the correct output when casting according to the loss dictionary defined in compile if a model output is not part of the loss function then it should be ignored when casting targets
the same code worked in tensorflow version in tensorflow version k module does not exist while in tensorflow version k module is tensorflow python util deprecation wrapper it makes the keras module not loaded during unpickling there are multiple applications use pickle to ship code to a remote machine to unpickle and execute e g spark horovod spark so the behavior change would fail the jobs btw one workaround is to do from import keras as k instead of import keras as k diff is that name is python keras api v1 in first case and second and pickle uses name get global names url l952 cc alsrgv hanyucui annarev
model save should save the model
not to crash when fit
it should only evaluate all outputs defined in keras model not only pick one
it should only summary one scalar
the training flag should be passed to tf keras layers stackedrnncells and to each stacked cell
no assertion error or at least a better explanation as to the cause
i want to see gpu0 and gpu 1 when run the device list command
tensorflow contrib integrate odeint should work with the default call method of any subclass of tf keras layers layer under both tensorflow version and version rc0
i expect tf keras layers add can process tensors of any dimension
the rnn layer should check the type of the rnncell and if it is a subclass of dropoutrnncellmixin reset the dropout masks after each call by calling cell reset recurrent dropout mask and cell reset dropout mask
the program can load model file successfully
the local variable packed should have a value set
there should be no error multi input rnns with stateful true should work the same as with stateful false other than preserving state
the memory should not grow indefinitely
converter convert finishes without errors
either don t produce a sigsegv but a more meaningful error message or simply don t fail at all
the test should pass on s390x
to compute the jacobian without complaining
in the example code below model summary outputs none 2 for the output shape according to the docs examples i would expect that to be none 2 when attempting to place layers after this it returns two placeholders despite the output shape only defining one
calling tf function from tf py function does not hang the program
sparse reshape should work similarly on both windows and unix based systems
model fit should not throw any error note this was working fine in version beta1
issue 1 documentation is fixed to reflect the correct behavior issue 2 the right shape is set for the tensor issue 3 reduce any should reduce all values when no axis is given irrespective of the shape
tf only use 1 thread and 1 cpu core
i d expect the error to be the same in case of addition subtraction multiplication as in case of division as it turns out to be the dtype issue
tf concat implicitly accepts any dtype as long as input dtypes match
working keras model should always be convertable to estimator
call compute mask and attach the mask to output regardless
fix is simple replace the lines url l954 l956 with python convert axis to list and resolve negatives if isinstance self axis int self axis self axis elif isinstance self tuple list
the stateful rnn should use the initial state the first time and then update the state and use it for each following time
train on 60000 samples epoch 1 5 60000 60000 3s 43us sample loss version accuracy version epoch 2 5 60000 2s 38us sample loss version accuracy version epoch 3 5 2s 38us sample loss accuracy epoch 4 5 2s 37us sample loss accuracy 2s 38us 10000 10000 0s 26us
load local cifarl dataset to numpy array without reporting any errors
it should just work
i expect this behavior tf tensor 0 11 0 10 9 0 0 12 shape 8 dtype int32 tf tensor 11 10 9 12 shape 8 dtype int32 tf tensor 11 10 9 12 shape 8 dtype int32 otherwise i need to find unique indices and delete multiples and why it is adding maybe other options are possible then too
i expect that memory should be cleaned
the expected output of the code below should be tf tensor id 4 shape dtype string numpy b hello tworld
the speed should be always very fast about 7s 100iterations
regardless of tfl converter optimization prediction on
convolutional layer in the tensorflow model should remain the same even after tfliteconverter
i would expect the names to match the layer names that the output comes from
i would have expected logging to place a minimal overhead cost on training performance perhaps related to the tf function compilation
should broadcast the same value to all devices
i tried this in python2 and there is no such issue could you look into it
metric values should not get mixed up
i read in tutorial url that wrapping iteration through the dataset with tf function should increase performance but instead of it computations move from gpu to cpu and as result slow down is it correct behavior i can fix this behavior by manual device placement by i think that computations should be done on gpu by default
gfile should support the python io semantics that supports seeking on a write only file more generally it would be preferable if gfile followed the api of python s io iobase url io iobase
code stops pretty soon
no error and the result should be 4
comparing if something none and is none should have the same behavior
it should work and run faster than eager mode
should be able to create a trt model using the latest docker build
read on an empty w file should return an empty string one problem with the current behavior is that numpy savez crashes when writing to a gfile
there should only be this many equal signs not
ram usage should not increase with epochs
no deprecation warning
training and evaluation should happen fine
when i set inter 1 and intra 1 i expect the usage of cpu is limited to 100
indicate the source of the problem possible resolution
only do things necessary for prediction while doing prediction a snakeviz flamegraph for prediction of our network in community keras showing no unnecessary overhead community keras url
as a tensorflow package i would expect the tf io gfile functions to allow the use of scalar string tensors or i would expect tensorflow to provide a solution similar to the numpy function inside tf function for these cases if not at least it should be a warning in the documentation that these functions cannot be used inside tf function
i want to run the object detection app on gpu by using gpu experimental with a self converted ssd model
i will be run another cell in jupyter notebook but i can t
i believe that from user point of view it would consistent if both examples gives exactly the same output there is no difference in architecture it would be better if sigmoid is applied no matter what are the initialization arguments of binarycrossentropy
the mnist py script is supposed to to achieve 99 test accuracy after 12 epochs of training doing a clean install of tensorflow gpu version and running the script achieves this result tensorflow gpu version version python version cuda cudnn this discrepancy between versions exists even when setting the numpy and tensorflow random seeds before training there are potentially major implications for the reproducibility of any work done in tensorflow across these versions why is this happening and or how can it be fixed
can train large model using without memory issue like
set tf cpp min log level 2 should prevent showing information warning logs including libpng warnings
i expect that using the use nnapi true flag will also display op profiling information
no error occurs and training continues
because of the identical implementations besides the difference in the way the model is built subclassing and functional api i would expect results to be same in other words i am confused why an exception is raised at all if using model subclassing
the frozen model does not seem to be corrupted because i was able to deploy the other version successfully fake quant should inherently be supported
on the the same machine using a virtualenv to force the use of non optimized tensorflow as follows virtualenv p python3 test source test bin activate pip3 install tensorflow version run 1 loss during step 0 version loss during step 1 version loss during step 2 version run 2 loss during step 0 1 2 run 3 0 1 2
when shuffling is enabled in tf data dataset list files i should be able to repeat the random sample indefinitely
not failing with feature column crossed column when subclassing the integration test here url l161 l183 didn t catch this problem
it should be possible to save a model containing all types of feature columns
what is this error for how to stop this from happening
the mirroredvariable class url l782 is a subclass of the distributeddelegate class url l375 which if i understand correctly means that mirroredvariables are supposed to act like regular tensors that you can perform ops on this works fine with most standard ops like multiplication division subtraction etc however if you try to use any tf math ops you get typeerror failed to convert object of type class tensorflow python distribute values mirrored to tensor
i would expect the mask to be propagated as if the inner layers were not in a sequential layer
the fetched result should be the value of the variable
save without error
which one is correct et log device placement true we can see queuedequeuev2 is on cpu clone 1 fifo queue dequeue queuedequeuev2 job worker replica 0 task 0 device cpu 0
i expect tf gather to work for the case in which the params argument is an attribute of the tf keras layers layer just as it does for the other cases mentioned
tf signal stft should work as it does without eager execution
without the distributed strategy i can readily pass a batch size of 300 to a given gpu within the distributed strategy this drops to 200 on 2 gpus and 70 on 4 gpus
successfully load library
in keras version fit generator simply calls the next gen function on the generator provided to fit generator this is working as expected
call to build should succeed
i can use batch renormalisation under mirrored strategy
the metal gpu delegate gives the same output as the cpu interpreter
no assertion as i computed the values by hand and expect them to be right
the sum should be 3
the model should train on two gpus asynchronously
save model correctly
the return value should be temp
when using x to tensor on the elements of the dataset the shape should be evaluated to the shape of tensor
running the model completes successfully
it should never sigabrt
sqrt 2 should be computed the same way every time
theoretically x y and y t x t t should evaluate to same value and their value should be same as numpy version
shape is not lost supposedly fixed here 16052
getting gradients without error
tf function does not change the behavior of any operations on tensors
either exception is thrown or the code is executed every time as it is it just welcomes bugs
my expectation was that if i pass a tf variable as the learning rate argument to tf keras optimizers adam and later assign a new value to the variable that would affect the optimization
according to the documentation url it should be possible to pass a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use as learning rate to tf keras optimizers adam and this can be useful for changing these values across different invocations of optimizer functions my expectation was that the adam optimizer would keep calling the supplied callable at each update i e from within apply gradients
close down cleanly
calling tf gradients with unconnected gradients zero returns appropriately shaped zero tensors for unconnected resource variables
hyperparameters do update on the first run ie they are initialized to tf variables at constructor of the optimizer not on first call
should not throw the above error
i got values but are not the same with the same image tested with ckpt files i have
significant reduce in the amount of warnings ideally to zero
dataset should iterate as it does in eager mode without tf function decorator
according to issue 36175 identity of bound methods python tracker url this is supposed to be expected behavior in python i merely want to clarify the autograph behavior and document this for other tensorflow users i guess there might be reasons to use identity is comparison on arguments when deciding whether an autograph needs retracing but if it were possible use equality comparison for arguments that are methods this surprising behavior could be avoided
calling the model should return a tensor not throw an exception
should be able to save and reload models that have been saved under mirror strategy
meaningful metrics
the dilated convolution can estimate the output shape as convolution op does
want to be able to use tfrecord data set with words and graph to lookup indexes via tf table and then parallel lookup imbedding vectors compute using 3 dim tensor this used to work with smaller set of embeddings anyway overcome this problem without rewriting data feed
1 decorating the function random choice with tf function should not affect tf case unless i am not aware of the intricacies of tf function and tf case 2 choosing for loops or list comprehension to create the list of predicate function pairs should not affect case unless again i am not aware of the intricacies and case
tf keras model save
release compiled model when i don t need it anymore
reproducible prediction from same input instance independent of row number or input length i use generalized row for a slice of a tensor with a given fixed first index e g x i or pred i
returns only the operations from name scope and preferable shorted by construction just like in the original list
return the batch size as plain tf
i would expect tensorflow has similar or better performance after the upgrade
variable main should keep its value main so it can be used to determine if the python code is imported as a module library or the entry point of a script
it should most likely work as it was possible in tensorflow 1 x
model has both inputs after loading
it should be possible to include none sized axes in the noise shape argument to tf keras layers dropout which are expanded at run time to the actual size of that axis in the input tensor of the layer
tf data experimental prefetch to device gpu 0 should leave tensors on gpu
i expect to see calculated shape with none only in first dimension
training proceed normally when the class weight parameter is included without running out of memory
restoring the model should succeed
expected behavior is latency when i parse the feature before hand and feed in per feature tensor there is lesser work for tensorflow to do so it should be faster or at worse the same why do we observe 2 3x higher latency is this due to the way feed dictionary gets copied from python to c
it should be zero
the model can be saved successfully
the training runs with dilation rate 2
using tf function when enumerating a dataset should not change the looping behavior
the tf keras model should return expected value rather than raising a error
was expecting to see higher throughput with tf trt
like with using an integer valued sparsetensor i expect tf sparse to dense to return a dense tensor with string values
successfully import the graph transforms module this code succesfully run with tf version but failed on tf version
gpu device creation should succeed if the user specifies use of the cuda malloc allocator
i expect file sizes and inference time to decrease
models whose layers have shared tied weights should not return duplicate weights when accessing the trainable variables property a super simple work around is to call list set model trainable variables but the real issue is the unexpected behavior why would i ever think that model trainable variables would return duplicates of the same variable two calls to test in code below should have same output
the resulting tensor should have a scalar value consistent with its static shape
the element shape of the tensorarray should be partially known consistent with the behavior of an equivalent tf while loop
i would like this function readtensorfromimagefile to work faster for 8k size images
expect to see a normal run since the variables are initialized inside the conv2d function
in the above example for i in y print i numpy should produce result without attributeerror for i in y print i numpy 0 1 2 3 4
calling map on a tf data dataset should leave available imports intact
no error is raised and the joint initial state is properly distributed by the bidirectional between the underlying forward and backward lstm instances
no warnings should be come from the tensorflow header
i think keras layer model should have output shape but they aren t please see if it s intended i ve just started to migrate from tf 1 x to tf version and to use keras apis so i might be wrong when using keras api
the pointer should not be null i have also tested it on mac os and it works fine but on linux it gives a null pointer
tf layers conv2d padding same is saved as padding is same
there should be no error message
i see all bounding boxes ground thruth in the tensorboard images pictures on the right
the memory allocated by an invocation of a call method using tf linalg expm should be freed number of call invocations plotted against memory allocated in gigabytes url
no errors when used correctly maybe that is the issue
multiple calls to predict should not degrade in performance over time when passing in a dataset
with alpha0 and the same code the history looks as follows alpha 0 url an upgrade of the tensorflow version should not affect the resulting accuracy in such a manner
the predicted output tensor for a given input tensor should always produce the same result regardless of the size of the batch sample is found in
tpu distribution strategy should be able to implement this
output the inference results
should work without any error
no exception thrown
model loaded simple models or not optimized work
while adding tf keras backend clear session to the loop helps this should not be necessary because in eager execution there is no graph to clear which according to the documentation url seems to be the only thing this function does destroys the current tf graph and creates a new one therefore it is also suprising that this function helps at all during eager execution expected behavior is that there is no memory leak even without tf keras backend clear session
if i look at the tensor before and after the depthwise conv2d the channel number should be preserved and look something like this ic x tf tensor fusion upsample transpose 1 0 shape 128 dtype float32 ic x tf tensor fusion transpose 1 0 shape 128 dtype float32 so imo depthwise conv2d with dilations and nchw it s loosing the information about number of channels
tflite model should be able to load and execute
tflite to actually use gpu when running conv2d networks
produce kind of the same results for the same models no matter c 1 or c 3 for cpu host tf and tflite and android tflite on cpu and gpudelegate
either all the metrics should be created with the exact same name or they should all have an integer added to the end of the second metric with that name
gpudelegate should load correctly and run inference on my android devices
i expect my tflite model to behave the same as my tensorflow h5 model but it always predicts the first class label with the same probability score i ve tried converting to tflite with tf gpu versions version version nightly version and tf version beta1
tf io write file should create an output file whether or not being decorated with tf function
the bias vectors should be shaped as they were in the original freeze graph model
screenshot 2019 06 28 20 53 03 url
tf cast should not change the bit representation of values
can we change them back to list for the single tensor case
save a png image of the model
convert keras model for edge tpu successfully
when running without dilation im able to handle the variable sized input also the fact that the conv layers with dilation can handle any input as long as its the first i would expect that no additional padding would be needed
no memory usage explosion
the boolean mask should be used when calculating the mean and variance to ignore any 0 s as a result of padded data
able to cache the filenames dataset
just return a bytestring of a 16bit png
only cache the dataset once and not throw an error
it should import fine i ve copied code directly from the official tensorflow keras getting started guides
i would expect it to allocate no more than 50 memory in my case it would be version mb
masking should be supported url l188 if a layer supports masking it should be a kwarg to call until all layers support masking it s not practical to only support masking via an upstream layer a layer can t always be inserted into a model because downstream convolution layers don t support it at all feeding the mask into the call of recurrent layer is the only workaround to combine convolution lstm and and it would be great if worked the same way for batchnorm encoded keras layers lstm 10 input mask input mask
there should not be a memory leak
i should be able to save the file
create maximal num threads and limit context switches
it is expected the warning is written to stderr
behave as per tf gradients
when any value of h help helpshort helpfull are provided as arguments to scripts using tf app flags the help list should appear
i d expect slice to have shape tensorshape none 10 5
the code in the function passed as an argument to map should not be run until the generator has yielded a value for it to operate on or an input argument for map allowing this behavior to be specified should be added if this is actually the intended behavior that should be made more clear in documentation for map
i think sequencefeatures call should accepts dense tensor objects and just don t try to convert them from sparse to dense
as with v version alpha 0 feature columns with constant vocabulary lists should be usable in tf function graphs
here is the expected output np version tf version
being able to use a dataset only for training but a numpy array for validation data
input data types are preserved when converting keras model to estimator
keras layers should use sensible default behavior and not have this smearing issue this causes serious problems for autoencoders gans and cost months of time correct behavior is seen with tf image resize o size size method tf image resizemethod bilinear keras upsampling should use this as the default instead of the current defective behavior note in tensorflow 1 x the tf image resize method had an align corners parameter that toggled between defective and proper behavior and was set to false defective by default in tensorflow 2 this parameter has been removed the correct align corners true is now default keras layer should follow same path
when run on tf version log txt is created and the logging is being recorded correctly
i tested all variables all of them are tf tensor
i expect it to work as advertised
tflite micro s fastint32tobufferleft url l80 causes error c4146 unary minus operator applied to unsigned type result still unsigned on visual c meanwhile tensoflow s implementaion has no problem this issue can be solved by rewriting u u to u 0 u as follows tflite micro s fastint32tobufferleft url l80 cpp populates the provided buffer with an ascii representation of the number char fastint32tobufferleft int32 t i char buffer uint32 t i if i 0 buffer return fastuint32tobufferleft buffer 10 tensorflow s fastint32tobufferleft url l131 cpp size t int32 i char uint32 size t length 0 if 0 length we need to do the negation in modular e unsigned arithmetic msvc apparently warns for plain so we write the equivalent expression instead length fastuint32tobufferleft return length
since we only know the end is called before closing the session i think the changed result should be store in the chekpoint otherwise document should provide ordering of executing all hooks
given a batched ragged tensor x manually building a new one using tf raggedtensor from value rowids x values x value rowids should work currently this raise an exception at runtime not during graph construction
it s supposed to train the model and not throw the error
no warning and building a graph successfully
basically just as it is now without increasing used memory every single time i do the inference
code should run
finish conversion without any errors
the training should finish after the set number of epochs
the behavior goes away and works without problem if i comment out the loggingtensorhook parts yet i have no idea what s the relevant issue the training fails with a very vague exception which only says that last op tf reduce mean in my case has been marked as not fetchable and no other useful information provided it makes it almost impossible to find actual cause of problem since exception points to wrong op reduce mean which was actually not problem
should work especially since pywrap tensorflow internal pyd already successfully loaded into the python process and so did cudnn64 7 dll
it should show indices as 0 0 4 4 4 4 and throw a warning saying that the range needs to be updated
setshapefn should get meaningful ptr
got the same result with quantized model between cpu model and nnapi
since i have many networks served on the same gpu i would like them to take as low vram as possible each of them being in a separated process easier to schedule finding the good per process gpu memory fraction for each neural network is a bit complicated since i have to grope
having looked at the source code i would expect on epoch end to be triggered at the end of each epoch
all models work as good as your hosted model
importing that module should succeed python c import tensorflow summary echo 0
i expect that the latest post training quantization should remain as fast as the one in version version
graph mode should always be faster than eager mode graph mode in tf version should be at least approximately as fast as graph mode in tf 1 x
i expect to get the same variable names in a layer no matter how layer is used
i expect the dataset to be reshuffled after each epoch right now it s not even when i use reshuffle each iteration true in the dataset s shuffle method this argument seems to only shuffle between iterations within one epoch
i assume that the mse should be equivalent to the mae squared but i may be wrong
either the save model should always work i believe this is a feature goal and the documentation should reflect this or if the save is likely to produce incorrect results it should raise an error and the documentation should continue to suggest that custom models can only be saved with save weights feature
the framework should be named libtensorflow framework so 2
an exception should be thrown when the condition in tf scatter add is not met
convert spacetobatchnd conv2d batchtospacend into a singe depthwise conv 2d v2 dilation 2
it should work the commit that introduced this behavior is url diff

the crossshardoptimizer shouldn t break
wrapper should succesfully apply to layer previously worked in tf version
i want to be able to see the results of each step of the variable at runtime through
models created will be collected by gc and memory usage go down to initial level
we only need decorate the outermost method
the expected behavior should be the same as simplernn re sample dropout masks on each call
the tensorflow keras function load weights to have the same syntax as keras s
i expect soft placement to fallback to using the cpu no error
dict objects wrapped around dictwrapper by autotrackable are serializable by pickle
tflite gpu supported ops must run in gpu if there are unsupported ops in the graph for which execution cannot be done execution must fall back to cpu
i would expect the shape of x to be tensorshape dimension none dimension 3 dimension 4
wrapping the optimizer in a lossscaleoptimizer should work transparently with keras models as it implements tf optimizers optimizer base class to solve this problem there s a need to either pass undelying optimizer variables method together with passing lossscalemanager variables too or fill slot and non slot variables some other way workaround example class def variables self return self loss scale self num good steps self num bad steps class mylossscaleoptimizer lossscaleoptimizer def return opt loss scale manager
if repeat is being invoked repeat the dataset
successful keras installation

python in 4 tf sigmoid a out 4 tf tensor id 1 shape 5 dtype float32 numpy array nan nan nan nan dtype float32
no cpu memory leak when training models on gpu device using tf function
i would expect to be able to train an lstm using sample weight and batch size 1 as far as i understand it sample weight can be used for weighting the loss function and according to the docs url it can be a flat 1d numpy array with the same length as the input samples i e same length as batch size
in tf v1 the dataset instance should inherit from datasetv1 not datasetv2
i think the behavior of training data and validation data in keras model fit should be consistent this would make keras a lot easier to use together with tf data because it gets rid of the need for defining a exact number of steps
train the keras estimator without errors
the tensorflow lite model should run without errors in gpu and cpu with element wise operators
valid gradient for the weights in the sparsetensor whatever the number of calls done previously to the model
same output as making predictions immediately after training
i would expect only as many iterations as specified by steps per epoch in each iteration while it s possible i have misunderstood something this is the behavior in tensorflow 1 when i run analogous code
not getting the attribute error
tf data dataset cache should produce a similar file compared to the input tfrecord files
i expected less memory usage from this lite tool
np matmul a b should be very close to tf matmul a b when a b are both float64s this issue is compounding over a spectrogram preprocessing pipeline making tensorflow unusable for pushing my signal preprocessing from numpy into tensorflow
it should not throw any type of error during training
the iterator should cleanup incomplete cache files if finished or if the process exits this would be really handy when running multiple runs on the machine and if processes might error or finish before the cache has been complete
without distribution strategy everything works fine
i think the second evaluation should also work because i use padding same
this function should handle these primitive types
the keras callback set model method should be called after the whole model is populated
i would expect that the convolutional weights are visualized i know this would be a huge amount of images c in c out but i think the current behavior is confusing
nothing should be printed
gpu memory should be controled
when passing steps per epoch to model fit as a parameter when training on data fed via a tf keras utils sequence instance the model should be updated exactly steps per epoch times in every epoch
i expect the code to return a single number
random output should be different on each call in both graph and eager modes
creating a variable should be completed within acceptable time
with what i understand about tensorflow version is that this performance should be the same similar for this code see next item for the code
the model can be trained regardless of tf keras backend set learning phase 1 because i used model train on batch it should handle learning phase internally
tf keras model fit generator should work properly with input of type dict
errors should be rasied if inputs and tf tensorspec are not compatible with each other
code should run with no error
either tf cast gives me a tensor that tells me it s on the cpu or else tf cast should work correctly either the tensor s device is wrong or tf cast is wrong
the expected output is version version
sub operator should be running on the gpu as per the documentation provided
it should load the model correctly even it the restore from the savedmodel is performed inside a distribution strategy context
running tfbdg with a filter vs running without a filter produces the same code errors when dealing with catching outofrangeerrors
enter debugging tools
print the value of tensors in the dataset
there are a couple of questions i have 1 while i realize that numpy and tensorflow as two completely different libraries should the disparity in performance be this much i am overriding the init build and call functions while making the appropriate super calls as per your article am i doing something wrong 2 do custom layers use the cpu by default also tried forcing it by including a with tf device gpu 0 call but that doesn t seem to help at all realize that it might be more efficient to code convolution by adding a custom op but want to avoid that in prototyping stage as much as possible
i was expecting similar behavior for both categorical crossentropy and tf keras losses categoricalcrossentropy
no error should return the warped image
run as normal like in previous version s of tf keras
these key properties and methods should in dataset of tf version
please revert to the behavior available in tf nightly gpu version preview version
predict results of fitted model with tf data dataset using model predict
this should work the same as when using a lower level implementation with a gradienttape working fine no error
tf image resize image with pad image 108 56 should always give an output of 108 by 56
it should be possible to check whether tensorflow is executing eagerly before programs enable eager execution this is relevant for forward compatibility with tensorflow version alpha0 which does not implement enable eager execution but instead reports attributeerror module object has no attribute enable eager execution
the names of the outputs should not change this breaks all code that loads the model and relies on the correct names
the mean squared error metric should always be lesser than the loss as it is when training the model with custom code instead of using the fit method
as described in tflite document url conv 2d should accept optional bias tensor and does not raise runtimeerror
a result of image classification should be returned
pixel values are different
dtype warning should not be shown
tf io decode image and tf image resize should work without any exception in dataset map
should not show warning
either have a tf keras layers cudnnlstm or remove the warning
compile the model without raising any exceptions
the 60 elements of the output of matmul x w should match exactly the first 60 outputs of matmul tf tile x 1 2 1 w
get output details returns unique list of outputs
tf tuple should support index with tensor in graph mode
the nadam optimizer will be deterministic
tf while loop only loops more than once
if we uncomment the new module class the output is much more informative i think this should be the expected behavior model model layer type output shape param connected to input 1 inputlayer none 10 0 dense dense none 10 110 input 1 0 0 dense 3 0 dense 1 none 10 110 1 2 none 10 110 3 110 2 2 total params 440 trainable params 440 non trainable params
should be able to load regardless of the size of variable
when tf keras layers lambda is created without mask argument it does not support masking therefore when a mask is passed it should raise an exception similarly to what layer compute mask does url l494
the quantized model should work on nnapi
a reduction in size
model build input shape will succeed and corresponding model variables are created
memory usage of tf version should be same or similar to other libraries not double
all workers progress thru the benchmark and finish successfully right now it seems a a minimum of one and a max of 4 fail with the error above
it should reduce lr when val loss doesn t improve
savedmodel should produce same outputs as the original model
report the actual error provide mechanism to catch the exception and handle it
if using map and batch one get changing results like 0 1 2 3 4 0 0 0 1 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 there should be always only one and non duplicate non zeros per line
this was supposed to show a live camera preview
usage of tf keras layers cudnnlstm doesn t throw an attributeerror when being a suggested solution
the nodes in the with block are executed after the dependant nodes

different seeds to produce different performance parameters specially if the dataset is small or if the optimizer only takes a step for a small batch size
tensorflow should import properly
i would like this code to work without needing to enable persistence mode
the steps epochs counters should be restored to allow continuation of training if they are not restored e g tensorboard cannot be used properly since the new training will write its values to the same steps as the first training instead of appending them result looks like this unbenannt url
i expect no error when i call tf summary scalar in tf version in both gpu and cpu mode
derivatives of non holomorphic functions should becorrect
be able to run the scripts
no errors during model compile just like when using keras instead of tf keras
i hope the map function can also work in eager mode to ease the coding difficulty
code should run without error in the how to
expectation the graph can be convert to tflite file
distribution strategies should support conditional parameters update
plugins should build successfully
the same was working with tf 1 x
the model should converge to a much higher accuracy and the moving mean and variance operations should be visible in the update ops
the order should change for every iteration
hope all the tensor could be eagertensor in tf version
the model will be loaded successfully
the session should return a scalar float just value estimate it should not be in an ndarray workaround get the actual scalar float in the ndarray if it is not a float url l199 l200 python if not isinstance value estimate float value estimate value estimate 0 0
expected output shape output 64 64 8
i d expect that assignment to a local variable doesn t change the ability to compute gradients
strided slice should calculate the shape of the output tensor correctly
the e1102 warning should not be raised
tf upgrade v2 should work in in jupyter and google colab
i expect it to show the graph for the model
the code should also execute normally when using tf function
attributeerror sparsetensor object has no attribute tocoo
the expected print should be 0 9 for both x and seed
ideally such a graph would not be referenced forever allowing it to be garbage collected
finish the 100 epochs of training and save the model h5
in the code attached below i have tested training with and without eager execution and with and without tf data dataset here are the training times for one epoch of training on a 4 core cpu eager tf data dataset 219s 22ms step without eager tf data dataset 25s 3ms step eager numpy dataset 26s 259us sample without numpy 26s 257us sample
it should be faster than adamoptimizer when sparse update
i expect custom cells to behave like custom layers the first time the cell is used all of its internal layers should be automatically built
get same inference time with jni on android
only layer instances should be tracked not classes
i m expecting the iterator release the memory each time it reinitialized
tf tranpose should be fast without the need to resort to reshaping tricks which will not always apply anyway note also that some transposes are implicit performed say by tf tensordot
use specified steps per epoch instead of len data if specified
tf name scope is applied to wights created by keras layers output in tf version is the expected behavior block dense kernel 0 block dense bias 0
the exception must be saliently catched 2019 03 29 13 52 version i tensorflow core platform cpu feature guard cc 141 your cpu supports instructions that this tensorflow binary was not compiled to use avx2 fma ran 2 tests in version s ok
to work as though if it was run without tf function e g in eager mode
similar outputs in both cases
would be nice if performance was approximately equivalent
should restore model rather than raise error
2 3 4 threads t 2 t 3 t 4 are expected to return the same results as single thread case
the example given in the tf keras metrics meaniou documentation should run without error
the trainable weights before and after saving should be the same as they are in tf version a0
cache won t run out of memory
the apply gradients once function should work even when annotated with tf function
i would like the set up to work with tensorflow as is with theano that is to share a reference with workers to save memory
saving and restoring the model should allow to resume training as if there was no interruption in the first place
subclassing tf module should expose the variables not to mention training variables from all sub computations including keras layers so long as these computations are set as members of the class
tf nn conv2d with data format nhwc should convergence as expected it should behave the same as data format nchw or naive dilated convolution implementation
being able to write to write to the summary from within the training loop
no segmentation fault ideally a stacked tensor returned i was adapting code i developed interactively in eager execution mode where it worked in a jupyter notebook for addition to a keras based model or an error that the argument cannot be a tensor this is the tf1 behavior typeerror expected list for values argument to pack op not tf tensor input 1 0 shape 128 128 1 dtype float32
when collecting batch level metrics epochs should be numbered with the epoch number
this should probably raise an exception numpy returns something meaningless in this case so is not a very good role model
calling a function decorated with the tf function should produce the same output as the same function without the decoration
the model can be loaded correctly
in my case the depth multiplier should be 1 and the size of the input channel dimension should be 6 i m not sure why it says it is 0
model should be updated with the variable y as a trainable weight
model should be updated with the variable y as a trainable weight
the code runs without a failure
decode predictions seems to be from keras applications imagenet utils here url instead
should be trained and logged
the updates should be placed on the default graph
maybe stream handler is colliding each other
the iterator the dataset should be converted in its graph representation
should fetch the first element of the iterator thus print 10
success to compile
tf keras rnn should be equivalent to dynamic rnn
gradients to be computed correctly
the rnn classes in tf nn should be compatible with all keras rnn layers
either sparsetensor should be more performant in initialization or should be saveable as a pickle object so i don t always have to re initialize it
return a ragged tensor regardless of the use of tf function
tf upgrade v2 does not fails if the file contains f strings
i would hope that the above 4 issues would be pointed out by the upgrade script as needing my attention even if it cannot for some reason although i imagine the one on line 63 can be done with a string replacement fix them automatically note i still haven t gotten this script despite some manual upgrading to work on tf2 but it pre manual upgrade works fine on tf version although it gives me a bunch a bunch of deprecation warnings
the example code should work without modifications
no segmentation fault when instantiating calibrator with the floating point ssd mobilenetv1 tf lite model
the build info module should also contain information about cuda version among other things
tf should utilize at least 80 gpu in my case since i m just running inference sessions in parallel in one process instead of having to resort to limiting ram usage and starting several processes
i expect return variable to return a reference not a copy of the variable
for every kernel that is queued on a gpu i expect it to be executed at some point and logged in the timeline
the training parameter should be passed as true when the model is training
i expect a function to be trace just once for a given set of inputs
1 the result of running on the gpu of the server should be the same as result of gpu running on tx2 there should not be such a big gap 2 gpu running result on tx2 should be same as cpu running result on tx2
i expect the same behavior as in regular python i should be the last value that was run in the for loop
i expect the custom model to be built automatically the first time it is called e g by the fit method
if in eager mode the tensors passed to the call method of a custom model should be eager tensors otherwise the advantages of eager mode like the ability to use native control flow are lost
according to the documentation provided model predict should also be able to take a tensorflow tensor as input
creating a mean instance should be harmless especially if it is unused
not to produce nans
the code below should run instead of giving an error
no error is raised if i use one of the following fixes 1 use tensorflow compat v1 disable eager execution 2 remove the conv2d layer 3 remove the batch size and epochs arguments from the fit call however context setter seems to have no effect and training is happening on gpu anyways i can tell by how fast it s training behavior seems weird can anyone explain what s going on
it should not run the code within its with block when global step n 0 or documentation should be added that describes the current behavior it defeats the purpose of it when i can combine an if statement with tf contrib summary always record summaries to produce better results
expected not to downgrade performance when upgrading tensorflow
these warnings should not be raised
the function should work in the same way as without the decorator but it doesn t
not see this error
the protobuf version should be consistent
i expect to be able to define metrics based on any layer s output when using the functional api
should not throw exception
gradients can be determined without error
run metadata should be saved even especially when session run fails
i d expect the sgd optimiser to be usable in eager execution mode
like other layers conv3dtranspose layer should automatically infer the dimension size as well
profile data after optimization node name requested bytes total execution time accelerator execution time cpu execution time matmul version mb version version version sec 0us sec
i would expect that when isgpudelegateavailable method provides only such a delegate that is capable preparing and running all the ops it should return false otherwise i guess is there some way how to tell this in advance or should i manually check for these kind of internal errors and try to fall back by recreating interpret without gpu support
should load normally and i should be able to continue training where it left off using the loss
no cpu idle time in prediction no parseexample op in inference should be faster
tf image random jpeg quality generates random jpeg quality for each image batch of images passed through it
it should train the model correctly it is running on cpu
expecting it to be faster on gpu
should import properly because it exists in path
the conv3d transpose operation should not see such a sudden drop in performance when increasing input size
it should be 1 0j as is returned by np complex 0 0
operations like addition are commutative swapping the position of operands doesn t change the result 1e 8 version tf identity version results in 1e 08 version tf identity version 1e 8 results in 1e 08
expected behavior according to my understanding is that as soon as
developers needn t care about which threads are used for calling these apis even these apis are called in different threads interpreter run should return correctly with blocking issue
the worker should run normally
the classes in tf rnn should be compatible with cells defined in tf keras layers
the tflite converter converts the tf keras model to tflite model
there are couple of issues with the existing behavior a ideally one should not be required to change the code in the callbacks but that is an ideal situation it is understandable to some extent that in cases such as mirroredstrategy a custom callback may require extra conditions b however what is strange or rather would be considered ill advised is the warning generated by tensorflow i e you can access each of individual distributed models using grouped model attribute of your original model warning seems to suggest that one should try to access an undocumented and private property of an object also there no grouped model attribute on self model anyways one that i see original said expected behavior document if a custom callback be designed considering some caveats when using mirroredstrategy and provide a public attribute and or method have access original
i generated them with fan in 100 fan out 100 and ploted their histogram i printed out the smallest and largest from the sampe and i got version version these should be 2
the compiled version prediction of a single image should be as fast as a non compiled prediction i suspect the compiled graph uses cpu for the inference
i expect it to be quicker with optimized graph
should load the graph without an exception
i would expect both version to be equally fast or the newer version to be faster in any case i would not expect the creation of the graph to slow down at each extra added layer also i cannot understand while sharing variables should be slower than instantiating from initializer with constant tensor
type in the code below and see no memory usage increases
should not be trying to access gcp metadata endpoint
tflite outputs is expected to match tensorflow outputs
np array x should run in a reasonable amount of time doing a simple list comprehension with tensor numpy shouldn t be faster
expected behavior is that the debugger does not crash and i can examine the tensors
invalid shape error expected this seems to happen on the gpu version i ve tested on another system but crashes on the cpu version on my mac
whether previous function call raised assertion error or not function result should be independent of previous function call
gradienttape gradient returns gradients for every variable in the var list same as tf gradient
i would expect at least 10x better performance on fake data generation
the program should print some logging information in autograph conversion e g autograph converted code information
i expect no error
translate test function return same results but on training model i got input start hace mucho frio aqui end predicted translation it s very cold here end on restored model i got input start hace mucho frio aqui end predicted translation shame back look right work to get right work to get looks almost random how can i save and load weight of tf keras custom model properly or does nightly solve the problem
expect fit time to remain constant even with multiple re compiles
batch normalization ops should have been folded into weights and biases of previous layers in the tflite graph in order to optimize inference latency
the program should run successfully
expect the load to be shared by all the available cores and the performance to scale up with increasing number of cores
no error the iterator produces a single batch
memory usage on the same order as it s on disc usage
distributed training can start successfully
we expect to get the same results when we use v1 or v2 we know that you guys are working on v2 of the while loops and we re really excited for it just wanted to make certain this was on your radar as a use case since didn t see it in the rfc
no error i just compiled the new master branch and it was working before
the error should not be raised because there is no loop in the computation graph
the code should run successfully
smaller size of output graph
i expect no error
expecting arm6 build of libtensorflow so and libtensorflow framework so to work the same as arm7 build
when i study the source code in tensorflow python ops embedding ops py tensorflow tensorflow python ops clip ops py line148 152 i think it should returns 0 0 0 0
in the original notebook example it prints out evaluation loss without error
runs and detects objects smoothly
the fakequant op should be added after the clip op
i expect model to dot to be available in tf keras utils vis utils or at least in tf keras utils
run tensorflow well in both files
i expect the same nice output as in previous versions such as input 1 0 0 dense 3 0 0 or concatenate
i expect it to save a png image of the model
ideally this would just work unless i m missing something
i expect no error and the kernel should be initialized to zeros just like when i set kernel initializer zeros
would expect the program to finish without a warning
if the tutorial was correct the code should run without any bugs and the evaluation results should be the same after loading
regarding the code snippet above we need inputs to be a list rather than a single operand and addinput should be addinputlist
the expected result is a sqrt 2
ideally it should work after all there s 128gib of hbm on the other side of this pipe so 2gib is really not unreasonable here worst case i d have expected an error status to be returned rather than a hard assert
variables copied using tf contrib copy graph copy variable to graph should have the same shape of original variables in order to make possible restoring from a checkpoint
no nan in the output similar value when running same op multiple times
i expect behavior not to differ from when providing arrays or lists of arrays as input i should be able to provide a tf data dataset as input that provides a single tensor or a list of tensors
1 isn t it an online algorithm it seems that the memory consumption of the tensorforest is relatively large 2 the original paper said that in large dataset like higgs 11m examples 28 features tensorforest with 100 trees and 10k nodes per tree trains in about
running example app with retrained model as shown in the guide url
run a convolutional neural network with no error messages
the result should the the sum of the elements on diagonal compare with np einsum ii matrix
tf contrib copy graph copy op to graph should copy the part of the graph containing the fold operation maybe it can manage in a particular way recursive blocks like fold
the api runner fetch predict sigmoid 0 run get 0 should run without error
it shouldn t print control characters
i should be able to pass a variable size image to the model the model pb file works fine in ubuntu
model predict will return the correct predicted value for the given data
current default limits for protobuf messages loaded by a codedinputstream are 2gib so my model should load without error
the expected behavior should be zero regardless if running on cpu or gpu because windows at these locations contain only zero entries because the only non zero entry is outside the window used to compute the value then this is most likely a buffer overflow or some other memory access issue
importing tensorflow should not influence the behavior of other toolkits
specifying no index means that i am accessing a list of tensors where as specifying an index gives me the tensor at that index
profiling works for both machines
run faster than gpu
tensorflow should refuse to perform a sparse dense multiplication that requires broadcasting this is the case when both tensors have the same rank or the rank of the sparse tensor is less than rank of dense tensor but not when rank of sparse tensor is greater
variables of inner tf keras dense layers should have different names such as dense kernel 0 dense bias 0 dense 1 kernel 0 1 bias 0 right now they have the same name kernel bias kernel bias this is problematic for saving loading parameters
no error message
with same command tf nightly version can get the right result and plot the bounding box
i think converter should be support scalar shape placeholder because tf users usually need scalar shape placeholder when they set dynamic params hyper params dropout ect in neural network
memory consumption should be bounded for any number of iterations
graph gets imported
the call to tf graphimportgraphdef must succeed
there should not be an performance decrease in this drastic
well the expected behavior is that generates correct result
two different runs should always have the same output
i expect the data api to allow me exploring data in eager execution mode even if i use the csvdataset class i can t use textlinedataset as my csv file contain multi line values in quotation marks
the path to cuda should be dynamically obtained by configuration or environment variables
the expected behavior would be the model compiling and fitting as it does with the model model input line uncommented the example below would also work when defining y pred zeros model tf zeros 32 20 outside of loss function but for adversarial training i need to call inside of loss function
if i increase the weighting by a certain factor the overall loss of the model should increase by the same factor given model is doing random guessing
detected files jpg
if i were using normal keras i d expect no errors trying to do the above and for the model to compile subsequently without issue
no error and able to get checkpoint path
all layers should be correctly created
should work like with tf version
there are a different blog post and resources on how to perform backpropagation for batch norm centering the data is a key part of any norm and it seems like auto differentiation is getting the value wrong or am i just going crazy i thought the gradient respect to the input variable should be 1 1 10 94 94 since 10 is dim 94 is dim 1 and 2
datasetb is expected to correspond to the order of shuffled dataset a
expected trainable variables are updated by optimizer but untrainable variables are not
since tf follows bsp it does not support ssp right these workers should be always under the same iteration when slow worker still stays in iteration 1 the other workers cannot go to iteration 3 or further
ideally all of these would work if that takes longer to do at least exposing the error message to the client rather than crashing would be desired
i want to change the input tensor size freely
the expected behavior is after toco the tflite still has one conv2d layer and one fully connected layer
it should not fail to create a concat primitive descriptor
the error should not occur if multi gpu support is not supported yet will it be in the future the documentation should also be updated then
model train returns without exceptions
every epoch should roughly take the same time
when gpu options visible device list is specified cuda contexts should only be created on the devices listed
there should be a way to disable mkl primitive memory reuse globally with an environment variable be it tf mkl optimize primitve memuse or better yet something else primitive memory reuse does not play nice with unknown tensor sizes as most of the time there are no cache hits and allocated memory is simply piled up in the cache
build should succeed
flops should be linear in batch dimension
it should run as it did before
the matmul function should return correct results regardless of sparsity or data type
to not throw the error as was the case for tensorflow version
it should simply update the variable and should output the following in a deterministic manner array 19 19 19 19 dtype float32 6 i suppose this is a bug in the caching process involved if the code is run on a gpu
tflite convert could be able to convert the frozen graph to a tflite model successfully
tf nn conv2d transpose with the same inputs is expected to produce the same outputs on different calls on gpu
cumsum should be as accurate as the float32 precision
i would have expected that autotune could pause and not start from scratch and would stay running quickly so long as i kept the session object around
code should work with eager execution mode
this cifar10 resnet has been updated to r version and used tf estimator train and evaluate to train model with the new feature of using distribute strategy it was found that the parameterserverstrategy ran normally but the raised an error in recvbufresponse
when i generate the profile file by using the low level approach of runoptions runmetadata and then writing the string generated by profiler serialize to string i can load it with tfprof and analyze it just fine this should happen even when using profilecontext
trainig should start and use the available 4 gpus
should not produce this error
expected behavior is no segfault version version version and version do not segfault i have not checked lower versions
ideally there should be no error as it is a model which works fine in keras tf backend
it should be able to handle larger tensors and batch sizes
internet access
expecting screenshot like below i got this when i have installed cloudflared locally and configured it as dns server without connecting to vpn img width 876 alt screenshot 2019 07 10 at 8 17 53 pm src url
to ask for api token and then location
playbook for updating user should work behind strict firewall
expect to installation successful
a dual stack connection after routing through the vpn
normal installation like localhost
a list of my eips for the region should show
successful config did not happen
ansible should run through all of its tasks and everything should work
i get a beatiful new vpn droplet
wireguard should support the network transition and maintain or at the very least quickly as in ipsec reestablish the vpn connection and allow traffic to pass
the client connects to the server and the vpn connection is established
algo playbook completes successfully
the requested linux headers from algo on a proxmox ct is
to be deployed and users created
it shouldn t disconnect silently it shouldn t disconnect at all
i expect it to fully install
if ec2 mfa is to be implemented a new feature request needs to be created until implemented the documentation needs to remove the suggestion that mfa is possible
in the past when i emailed myself the user mobileconfig file i just tapped on it and the ios settings page opened automatically
i expected setup to complete and configure the digital ocean server
1 able to connect on port 22 steps to reproduce
according to the docker instructions url when it exits you ll be left with a fully populated configs directory containing all appropriate configuration data for your clients and for future server management
deployment succeeded
i expect it to build the required configuration and software
certs to be installed in correct location
expected behavior is the ability to successfully install the profile on an ios device so vpn can be used using the password that was generated during the algo install
i would expect to be able to visit the webserver site without issue and load like normal
should be able to connect after a restart
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
no login promt everytime
should login and execute the app
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
i expect it to connect
row is added however app should not close crash
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
only one node should be shown for each key keys are unique
app not to crash
just show the data correctly
connection should be maintained via port 6380 rather than reverting to 6379 somehow the only way to see the correct keys again is to restart rdm
horizontal scrollbar working on console window copy very long text to clipboard and working drag
the lines starting with sh should not be considered as blank lines the and operators should jump only to lines 3 7 and 11 placing the cursor at line 4 and using the ip operator should select lines 4 5 and 6 placing cursor at line 8 using ip operator should select 8 9 10
cursorline should not be displayed other than the popup window
should not have the gap
external command should keep current directory as in linux do
the screen is restored without colors changing
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen like in vim version i expect that only background color will be changed but foreground color is should stay the same
there should be no error
the preceding tab character is not highlighted
the match should be included in the resulting highlight to reproduce for v gn search 5 and highlight 34567 from right to left then gn the resulting highlighted region is 67 but 567 is the correct behavior version without patch version works as expected i tested on direct parent of this patch
it outputs the mapping only once c c a xxx
vim outputs not from heredoc
the first command raises no errors and outputs x the second command raises no errors and outputs xx x xx
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen vim eval shouldn t change the value of dictionaries it evaluates
don t introduce extra blank line
the cursor should end up on the e character right after after the search in step 4
the callback of the closed popup should be triggered and the upper popup should be hided
for the command line window to be closed by the autocmd
i would expect that in the right window the list option is set to 1 the end of lines are displayed with a dollar character the tab characters are displayed with i because according to h local options vim should have remembered that x buffer was displayed in left window and in that window list option is set to 1 which is what happens when i run this similar shell command vim nu none sil pu repeat foo tbar 3 setl list bo vnew b x x
the text line of the cursor in the left window is highlighted by cursorline immediately without having to interactively focus the window once
c s save c v copy
expect the content pasted ok there
a list of omni complete suggestions should have appeared
there should not be such a paradox if it is local to window the behavior should not be local to buffer if it is local to buffer the doc should be updated and py vim current buffer options cursorline true should be the correct usage py vim current window options cursorline true not
the quickfixline highlighting starts from the beginning of the line which here displays tmp file 1 col 1
since the nontext highlight group usually does not have a termbg or guibg specified the showbreak character should use the popup window background colour
expected editor not to crash
the word in should be moved to the 4th column
the sorting order should change without corrupting the file listing
no sigabrt happens echoes x y 2
no sigabrt happens
to be able to send keys commands to the popup window without them being intercepted by the filter menu
no error since 128k is not large memory consumption and other text editor say sublime text has no problem with it
the x character is inserted in the buffer
only the first line is highlighted with cursorline
i would expect no error the cursor to stay on the first occurrence of test and the search register to contain test
cpu usage shouldn t noticeably change when a mouse click is made
that the quoted text s is highlighted as a string and the remainder of the line is highlighted correctly
at step 8 above i expected the text properties to be retained for the buffer after navigating away and back again if set hidden is used the text properties are retained at step 11 something has clearly gone wrong the contents of buffer are missing
i think both windows and macos should echo 4 which mean term getline should contain the last several spaces
filetype indenting should not slow down redraws so much in version jumping to the middle of a large file is still slower with filetype indent on but not so slow it exceeds redrawtime
it should not crash and it does not if cmd set spell is omitted or if the last word of the file is deleted
vim gives up that undo file and continue
traceback most recent call last file string line 1 in module keyboardinterrupt
after quitting the just now created tab the bottom of the maximized upper window moves one line upward i e its size changes one line this shouldn t happen
vim should open the url in a web browser
just the numbering is changed in steps 3 and 4 the text should not be redrawn
all commits should be pushed to a repo
the gitignore rule would ignore unix hidden files only anything that
add one single shiftwidth on newline independently from the tag
a border of the popup shows without the breaks
only the word test suggestion should be proposed i e actually completed instantly because of only single match
nothing visible happens
the file file pyc should be openend
expected result statuslinetermnc xxx term reverse ctermfg 0 ctermbg 2 guifg bg guibg lightgreen
the following values should be updated for the now hidden buffer hidden should be 1 windows should be an empty list
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen very fast to jump to definition

start from vertical column 4 since first character is tab tabstop 4
after step 7 vim should go back to the start screen it makes no sense to open again the last opened file in my case the start screen is startify but this happens also with vim clean the bugs happens also if you open text file before opening terminal inverting steps 3 and 4
because the file a is write protected rm prompts rm remove write protected regular empty file a in the command line while it didn t trigger the on stdout with this prompt
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
the fact that an exception is underway should not influence the parsing result of valid vimscript code that is supposed to be skipped during exception handling should not generate errors
a value virtcol 1 i guess
the calculation order of json encode should be faster than o n2
appearance of selection should not be there
it shows test and after one second test done
a new line appears in the buffer consisting of the word hello
there should be no prompt since there is plenty of space to fit the 2 2 numbers
normally it should just cut the whatever without the end
a message should be displayed but there is none
i would expect the output of echo to have been preserved even after focusing a different program window
there should be no spurious changes in syntax highlighting when visually selecting
it echoes cmd 4 static 0 name foo kind filename xtest like it did before version
no cursor graphical glitch
the dialog should not crash at least
one double click changes the image size only once
planner should direct car to space
the put request should at least not fail silently and i should be able to send chunks of my file to google cloud
i suggest optimizing the source code to the following js source code if typeof requestdata undefined key tolowercase content type remove content type if data is undefined delete requestheaders key after optimizing if key tolowercase content type typeof requestdata undefined config method tolowercase post typeof config params undefined config method tolowercase get remove content type if data is when method is post or params is when method get delete requestheaders key
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
just like in version version version i should get a 200 response
expected behavior is to have backup created
expected the cluster to come up and run properly
the table descriptor should no longer be visible in the offline state as soon as the restore or import completes
i expect the node process to terminate
flag log file max size and log dir max size work for both main and secondary logger
the env var should work in the same way as the command line flag
after decommission i would expect the cluster to trying to contact the terminated node
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
sucessful build a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen

the project build successfully
filter ranges match the bucket bounds of the clicked bar i haven t tested other visualizations but these should also work
the editor tab should contain div lorem ipsum div
is this a bug or my config isn t right
maps team needs to discuss and figure out if filter should get disabled when user accidentally starts zooming on the map

we don t get any errors on job installs by either filtering them or calling a different api which does not report errors on job installs back to us for duplicate id s
sorting to correctly change to the correct field it appears that chart updates to reflect body senttimestamp as the correct field but the table view continues to sort by the other field
if there is no logstash available to deploy the pipeline there should be an error message
the index is populated and ready to continue with the layer workflow
the logs shouldn t error
not to spam users constantly about not being able to install jobs that require more memory instead probably let the user know through another ui ux friendly way they cannot run some of the jobs with only 1 gig of memory
use 24hrs for the time range when selecting 6 months
should maintain the relative date time when crossing over to the ml page reference to the code that shows absolute position url
all saved objects that uses name of index pattern and not id continue to work after re creation of index pattern
see the metrics
they should fill in the kql search bar as well as choose the anomaly table by default
you only get the specific host you re looking at in the anomalies table
the check up should not fail if the version does not follow the semver format x x x it appears to happen in this part of the code where we try to detect old apm indices url l49 this error could be prevented by 1 filtering for apm patterns before checking version 2 handling any malformed version numbers
custom notification banner should display
edit page should show up decodeuri is missing to change test 20value to test value

the input and output should still appear and filters should have information n a
you should be able to add the filter
apart from clearing session information on logout there should be a way to invalidate cookies maybe by using a server side cache of sessions which can be used to verify a cookie these cookies or session cache data should get deleted on logout
load all index pattern titles not mappings loading the mappings up front when we load the mappings for the selected index later on seems pretty odd performance wise it s super expensive and makes kibana pretty unusable at times
1 suggestions and template population should happen while modifying agg type and not name
map should render completely similar to how it looks on screen
reporting should fail with a saved object is missing message instead it fails with a timeout error the only helpful message here is a debug level message server log 10 56 version debug browser execute jzvk8xcl0n2rcbae0cfn0lcf printable pdf reporting failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 not found
i dont think i fully understand elastic kibana already and all of its terms but to my understanding im only using two single value numeric metric aggregation s to try to have a dynamic gauge so this according to some tutorial page i found should give me a working gauge
in step 7 above the upper extent of the y axis should be max value of metric margin
the saved search is loaded
elastic search shouldn t hung crash
either a filter should be applied or the regions should not be interactable
all fields which are used in result set should be exported that would be the same behavior like the csv export int discovery module but the csv export shows some json like output 2019 08 23t12 57 version z timestamp 2019 08 23t12 57 version z i expected to find all fields which are used in the csv file
csv file contains timestamp and ip but csv file contains timestamp and hostname seems to be taken from saved search
that rest api is consistent with ui
sort correctly by using numeric type date nanos probably only when the format of the index pattern is switched to date nanos
counter should not be 0
the size should work
would expect the response time of post api spaces space to be similar to going direct to es this request took 94ms post kibana doc space test space space name test description description of color f8fd09 initials ts type

it should sort the numbers in an ascending way or descending way
you see the value that metricbeat has send e g ram value of 325 mbyte but what you see is a tenth of the value in this case version mbyte if you select the last 8 hours you will see the right value 325 mbyte
when we cannot find a related saved object a useful error should be displayed explaining what happened
show wms instead of base map
should download export
it should log to kibana log again and log reloading logging configuration due to sighup because of src core server bootstrap ts 91 this test should make sure it s happening url not sure why it doesn t fail
same behavior for both searches with a meaningful error message but category ccessories keeps on searching and pops up error loading data cannot read property map of null error dialog category ccessories displays no results message and pops up a lucene syntax warning error dialog behavior should be similar and dialog message should be more meaningful also the text in
above function was working on version version
should be able to create or edit a space with a custom color
if there is no index pattern the filter dropdowns can probably not get populated correctly maybe show the filter pill in a corrupted state in the first error case we could side load the correct index pattern as it s still there in second case filter pill could also get cleaned up when removing index pattern
it d be nice if there was a warning or alert that the user can t access this setting
should show all fields from all enabled filebeat modules
1 since we re in verbose logging mode and seeing debug level messages we should be seeing a lot more logs example of the browser console running the same page as the dashboard in the above report image url 2 headless browser is attributing type fields to each of its own logging events we should use those to map level of each headless generated log to our own logging so error logs show up with error tag in our logs
user sees only es2 nodes in the list
user is redirected back to the cluster listing page
no deprecation warnings
the role should accept the cluster privilege like so many of the reserved roles define themselves such as logstash system where i copied the privilege above for this example

the output for the fourth case should include the thrown object just as in the second case note that fourth case incorrectly reports a line number at start of function so it s not helpful if we could get line number of incorrect throw that would be ideal but i understand that that s probably not possible i ran into this with a throw occurred deep in a series of libraries so it was very difficult to track down
i expect the tests to pass as well when not run in band
jest circus works in a browser environment either by not using node specific packages or by in the source catching and preventing errors for non node environments

the test linked above should pass since the withancestor option should return both the current changes and the changes in last commit currently pattern we use to specify a revset errors because pattern specifies an empty range i managed to solve this locally myself by using ancestors 0 as argument for revset but i m not sure whether this solution covers all necessary edge cases since i don t use mercurial myself i thought it was better to open an issue and see what other mercurial users think of this solution if this is a satisfactory solution can open a pr as already have these changes commited to branch url
both tests pass

behaviour i used to have for the past month and a half developing in ionic plug my phone to the pc make sure it connected and working using adb devices start developing something deciding it time to test it deploy the app to the phone by using ionic cordova run android target if app was installed it would update if wasn would be installed and stay installed even after closing i could open up again using launcher if i ever wanted would be literally installed as any other app whenever i made big alterations sqlite local database such as creating new tables completely wipe s data and uninstall app since updating created conflicts deployed again clean everything worked happy dev

cards shouldn t flicker data shown should match the respective item
the animation property would be included in the ion router outlet directive in ionic angular
console log received a notification notification should display log data from notification

the event ionbackdroptap should not be triggered within the same press action it should only trigger when the popover is fully displayed and a new user interaction happens
the attribute above to be working as expected for example color primary shade producing color theme of 3171e0 and also the other color anything shade tint contrast based on default src theme variables scss
should compile without error
5 when i call push on an ion nav it only affects the ion nav it was called on
it is expected that the application starts just like it does on an android device where the app starts without problems
as for non autofilled inputs floating labels must stay entirely visible
classname should be appended to any needed classes built in to ionic this would allow the use of css in js which is becoming more and more common also with some apps like the one i m working on we need to easily set variables via a network retrieved file that contains colors and other customizations
after a secondary style window is hidden allow a hook to unmount the contents so the cleanup can occur
opening a modal should unfocus controls in the background
the app should focus on the ion input element that has the property autofocus set to true
the navigation should happen with a clean transition not flickering to the previous page
i would assume that the background should be transparent somehow and i can see what is underneath it through
the property button color should work as advertised
available days should include all days from min value day to last day of the month and from first day of next month to max value day
the grouped items should be dragged properly
switch between tabs and use the refresher normally without it stop working

navigating from tabs tab1 to settings would invoke ionviewwillleave on tab1page and navigating back would again invoke ionviewwillenter on tab1page
cpu not going high
cpu not going high
return the same certificate for each host
since url doesn t mention any peculiarities and i was under the assumption that citadel would generate these tokens automatically it is a bug that istio token is not generated here is one of the many configs that reference the token name istio token projected sources serviceaccounttoken path istio token expirationseconds 43200 audience istio c in this case from deployment ingressgateway s spec for proxy

connection and upgrade headers are passed through intact to the the backend application
not to see 503 s on these long running requests

sidecar should follow the mechanism of sending check request even under high load
kiali should show the traffic for bookinfo app
the inbound listener is not removed and the pod is able to accept inbound traffic until the main container stops
package shoud install correctly operation works with the previous version version
istioctl version remote gives the client information

a mydomain com should be able to contact auth mydomain com even if auth mydomain com runs on a different node than the ingress controller
http requests cancelled by client should be reported with 4xx status code to distinguish them from real server failures
istioctl should show ok instead
i would expect the pod to eventually get the certificate and start working
no 504s when the upstream isn t timing out
we shouldn t get conflicts or listeners being configured for ports that we don t want istio to care about
routing of the endpoints to the correct services and 404 on end points that do not match the list
i would expect cross cluster calls to be routed the same way for cluster internal and cluster external calls instead of cutting straight to the actual service

the destination service name label for tcp metrics should be set to blackholecluster or passthroughcluster in these cases
https request for container can also be tracked
destination service label is set to the destination service host attribute
i should be able to connect to postgress successfully
when 2 serviceentry instances are created for a single host having the locality set traffic should be routed by considering the egress locality just like how it respects locality when routing directly from a sidecar
ip whitelist works for a specific ip
pilot continues serving discovery requests from existing sidecars
all the pods in running state
gf paths data data grafana is writable and grafana pod starts successfully
according to url l26 the default values for ingressclass is istio and the istiocontrollermode is strict therefore i shouldn t have had to update the mesh config in the istio configmap in order to use kubernetes ingress resources especially since these values cannot be set in helm chart today

should be able to layer both the charts on a single graph as per url
would simply expect the x axis and grouping variables to remain as the filter is added
the way stupid me understands the ui is that the sid is required whereas the tns is optional however after a lot of trial and error documentation and logs parsing i ve found that magic working configuration is setting container as oracle service name and leaving sid empty img src url width 350 i guess it makes sense because these are same details used for connecting via sqlplus but i tried quite some time by using container as sid because i understood this entry as required what obviously didn t worked however using

prisma export should retry queries after waiting a little bit when they fail instead of failing screenshots
provided both indices and values are placed on the same device torch sparse coo tensor should return a sparse tensor on that device
error message should say that the attribute exists but is of an unrecognized type
provide a non deprecated way for cpp extensions similarly no alternative to at check at assertm nor torch jit registeroperators is provided for cpp extensions
that you can successfully jit nn rnn like you can with nn lstm and nn gru
i except that a call to torch randperm inside a worker process doesn t touch the process affinity
argument shouldn t change
torch arange should not change the shape of the target tensor
load state dict replaces the currently none buffer with the non none saved buffer from the state dict
return a completely new model
cuda being available
installation of pytorch with cuda version
at the very least the correct error message should be displayed runtimeerror unsupported operation more than one element of the written to tensor refers to a single memory location please clone the tensor before performing operation ideally since old parameter data is being overwritten anyways module load state dict should catch this exception and find another way to load checkpointed data
onnx randomuniform export must by supported by torch and onnx model must be generated for all cases in the example script
for the scriptification to pass without errors
code should compile with clang and libc
it was working in version for both torch sum and torch mean
run successfully
should finish all together on epoch 5
the initial learning rate should change as a function of div factor
they should have almost the same speed
it shall be all identical among runs
the nvidia smi will show an increase in memory usage while the torch cuda says it s using 0 memory the nvidia smi shows from 200 mb to 700 mb
in document here url torch var torch var input dim keepdim false unbiased true out none tensor dim should be available to pass int or tuple of python ints
memory consumption stays constant as the first iteration
type promotion should work correctly and the second assignment above should assign correct values
i see that this is a corner case but if we change to dev torch device cpu we get torch size 2 0 4 which i see as more reasonable
producer consumer memory shouldn t grow
i d expect the backward pass to run at least 100 times faster in fact the performance is as expected when running the script on a different computer performance for linear layers is also as expected
the save function should be able to find the source code the offending code is located at serialize py 288 290 the call source join obj fails in version version this line retrieves source code of nn module with inspect package but now it seems to try to access string representation of nn module
expected behavior is low memory usage as in pytorch version alternatively a way to control caching e g something which disables caching or something like torch cuda clear caches but for cpu as i understand high memory usage happens because allocations are cached which makes sense for fixed shapes but does not work well for variable shapes binning shapes is possible as a work around but has a noticeable performance penalty and memory usage is still higher
cholesky of a positive definite matrix shouldn t run into an error
it ought have thrown something like this runtimeerror cuda error invalid device ordinal
torch hub works with arbitrary git tags and branches
no unresolved reference hinted
at least order of indexes should match
should be almost instance
i expect the conversion to onnx
i understand the switch from torch uint8 to torch bool is fairly recent and that torch unique does not seem very useful on booleans but the feature is very useful when specifying the dim argument torch unique on boolean sequences for instance
i am not sure what the print format should be but ideally i would like to see that only the modules passed in the constructor are executed in forward the documentation url torch nn sequential only mentions constructors and modules added via setattr would be treated as if they were assigned to a regular nn module that is registered but not automatically executed another solution would be to just document this as a feature my preference for former is that i have code which looks like this python class customseq nn sequential def init self meta metaparametermodule super customseq self init customlayer meta customlayer meta self meta where metaparametermodule doesn t even implement forward it just stores some learnable interpolation parameters global to customseq which i would like easily access was very surprised seeing that running customseq input results in notimplementederror can obviously workaround with something like python property def self return 0 but it s a bit awkward
the above snippet should run without an assertionerror the problematic assertion must only be checked if kdim is none and vdim is none i e if self qkv same embed dim is true the forward function correctly checks the value of self qkv same embed dim and calls f multi head attention forward with appropriate arguments including use separate proj weight true and separate query key and value projection weights so in f multi head attention forward this assertion should only be checked if use separate proj weight is false
no exceptions thrown
i expected a consistent behavior that frees the memory after the oom exception occurred or at least after gc collect gets called
update moduledict with moduledict items will work another callbacks update model callbacks items another callbacks moduledict lin a linear in features 20 out features 5 bias true lin b linear in features 20 out features 10 bias true
cpu usage 100 and torch get num threads 1
not throw an exception and instead return silently and run properly
just like on normal tensors tensor record stream on a view tensor which has shifted storage offset should record the stream to protect against unexpected reallocation
the backward to work as expected without cuda crashing
since the torch src dir csrc cuda comm cpp file has ifdef use nccl statements one would expect that in a use nccl enabled build of pytorch calling torch cuda comm broadcast would use nccl for the broadcast
code should run without an error
working tracing
one process more threads higher cpu usage
torch bernoulli input should always return 0 for every 0 in input
i expect that setting os environ cuda visible devices to the index of a specific gpu and allocating tensors by the device name returned calling torch cuda current device have all memory allocations and computations happen on that specific gpu
the crashing assignment a true torch ones 1 device cuda should either work or at least raise an informative error and not crash
import torch does not error out
i expect aten functions h to exist after calling scripts build android sh
cudnn should be called if we replace functionconvtranspose2d apply by f conv transpose2d the logs are not empty
scatter add should not assume fixed tensor sizes
for model to export properly
gpu and cpu should have the same output
the normal expected result in torch version python version version default mar 27 2019 22 11 17 gcc version torch class numpy ndarray 300 400 tensor done the stuck output in torch python default aug 13 2019 20 35 49 gcc torch class numpy ndarray 300 400
can import properly
converts to float as normal
getting the same format as the mask unless it s meant to be yyyy mm dd all the time for a specific reason
i expect android studio to open the capacitor project
qcolor should not close when used inside a qdialog qpopupproxy
i expected the qimg to render with a height 0px every time
the click function should not throw an error when there are no arguments passed to it
age field validation should fail but submit notification should not be shown as the form should not be submitted when there is failed validation contrast this behavior with synchronous validation url
should only require one click to select an option
platform is mac should be false platform is desktop should be false platform is ipad should be true
paste should work
the click on a free space in toolbar should not deselect all selected items browser chrome version version
all documented events should be handled also via on
by default the role tablist should be applied and a can be changed by passing in the role prop into nav element
no syntax error since the readme page claims a browserlist target of version not dead which would include ie 11
dropping works even when in iframes
the inputs should still accept dropped text
should not throw a warning error
the subtitle would appear on the right side rather than below the title
each type i type a symbol in the input of my toolbar the onchangetext method call this searchforterm text who made a request on a api this api send back an array of words this array populates the flat list the autocompletion is made if user decide to add symbols for his term or delete symbols flat list should be refreshed with new result of api toolbar searchable autofocus true placeholder onchangetext text this searchforterm text onsearchclosed searchclosed

it is to be installed
it should display a beautiful icon with symbol and text like show on the docs url
i can see the new letter
in android after loading an image the spinner should not render anymore
adding share to the original source should prevent observable duplication
interval 0 animationframescheduler should emit once each frame
i expected the following output stoper on message next stoper on complete complete finalize i expect that the complete callback passed to tap operator to be called after the source observable is completed in this case bacause of take operator
should not create larger and larger stack traces
same behavior as when not in strict mode
optimally the call order should mirror this console output console onnext finalize 1 finalize 2 finalize 3 finalize 4 oncomplete if it is intended that the calls are happening after the completion this would be the alternative console output console onnext oncomplete 1 2 3 4
ideally an error would be thrown if this assertion was missed but i assume that s not possible so couldn t there be a lint rule to do it instead
the log should be called 5 times with respective notification next next error next complete
in the above code snippet i would expect nextblockrange to be called after the previous createprocessstream stream is completed however it is called every time createprocessstream emits a new value the only way i could manage to make it work is by adding the last operator as follows js from getevents pipe concatmap createprocessstream last concatmap nextblockrange errorhandler
expect to printout switchmap function js output switchmap function switchmap project return operators 1 switchmap project this
i would expect that a warning be thrown indicating that there appears to be more than one case used across different imports of the same thing though this may also be something better reserved for a linter or ideally it just works and automatically uses the same case for all imports
the observable should not be change it s state to error if the error has been caught
it looks like retry cannot correctly detect whether a request was successful or it has failed this issue is reproducible only if a client and api are hosted on different domains i expect that only one single get request is sent
every window has a chance to produce values like with mergemap js opened window 0 source 1 in window 0 1 source 2 in window 0 2 source 3 in 0 3 closed opened 1 source 4 in 1 4 5 5 6 6 closed opened 2 7 2 7 8 8 9 9 closed opened 3 10 3 10 complete closed 11 complete 4 4 5 5 6 6 complete 7 7 8 8 9 9 complete 10 10

discussions item in more menu should be hidden
jump to message option should be available
thread results should be populated
scrollbar should be visible and working
since the thread view is open already its composer should be used instead of the main view one
the connection to the ldap and the account consultation is going well it finds the ldap user account in logs on other hand it stops in logs just after ldap disconnection rocketchat 1 ldap search info closed then it is necessary to wait 1 minute before it continues on line concerning synchronization of data rocketchat 1 ldapsync info syncing user data is this minute that causes these delays in first connections
a scroll should appear in the message box
should work like before
user logged in and custom field is updated
discussions label should be hidden
user gets deleted deactivated in rocketchat there should be different possibilities to configure the sync behavior here based on the fact if the user just gets deactivated or completely deleted in crowd never deactivate delete disable in both cases disabled deactivated delete non existant deleted user delete in both cases additionally if the sync of one user fails it should not fail whole sync but just log reason for error of that specific this happens for example when there are duplicate keys e g there are multiple users with same email address which might happen crowd technical users

story compilation succeeds
yarn command to finish
there should be a way to pass and access environment variables to storybook webpack config
csf and storyof stories should be sorted together into an alphabetized list
nothing serious will happen because the state is not being used yet but storybook should not display any errors
i expect it to show the code that is used to power whatever is placed within the preview components
using raw html in mdx would behave as straight html
description and the props description should not be empty null
if the specified port ie using the option p for start storybook is available it should run without any prompt
i expect the docs page or the info page to have the props table but it doesnt
empty rows are allowed inside mdx template
when a nav link from the menu is clicked go straight to the selected story without going back to the top of page
es module won t appear
trigger action and show on addon page
works and show the source code of the stories
the description column for the test prop should include the please work comment as well as the string type it should look like this image url
expected to see the props and description
i d have expected arrows and regular functions to be interchangeable in csf
should log the webpack config in the terminal and similar to info custom webpack config loaded
i expect to see the addons panel if i have an addon installed to be used
expect storybook to ask which version similar to what create react app does or have some way to workaround this if create react app is broken
knobs change props
docs should appear
i expected this output screenshot 2019 10 10 at 16 08 56 url
promise prototype finally to no be removed
i expect simple story with woot text in it and no exceptions in the console
the configs in the env mycustomtargetname file are loaded and respected
i suppose they should be displayed i think no research though that people usually treat error message as plaintext and don t relaly throw html stylized errors
i would like to be able to add some specific css only to the stories without affecting the rest of storybook
styles should be overruled if the documentation indicated i can overrule them
there should not be any errors
select could check the type of all the values provided and if all are numbers coerces parse the value to a number type like the way number knob does or could have an optional param to say isnumber but that seems messy
prop types should be detected correctly story source should show component name
it should not have any error
the command should not throw
always increment decrement by 1 regardless of number of hot reloading
i want to view my customized materialui component
no error should happen
keep scroll up at the top
should display description as expected
1 run storybook locally 2 follow an example like that one url 1 via imports 3 inspect the request show
that it compiles
the gray highlight precisely covers the selected story in the storysource panel
there shouldn t be an error in the console and and storybook should load
as with previous react react native versions the addons panel should not render overlayed on the preview panel on launch and should only show when it s navigated to via the bottom toolbar
i expected the generated file to match my latest attempt
i expect the faq to save without problems the group field seems to work sometime and not work some other times
i would like that the url points to the current domain url aka not url
strapi changes the fields names both in the database and in strapi
required true false option is missing for related fields
removed fields should be removed from the database as well
server will start up and connect to the database with the provided settings in config environments production database json
a new user is created
my strapi project should now be available at url
when i upload an image it must remove all old relations from file upload
maintain the session on the same browser in all tabs
return the object of the nested object instead of null
strapi should startup
result should be an array containing documents that match the query parameters
i d like to be able to keep a reference to the item and render an appropriate label i guess given how funky this control works in the browser i m not sure what the ideal way to handle it is
it should be possible to create any attribute with any value that does not contradict the standard
the second repl should work alternatively if i could somehow bind the this for the on submit function would that make this problem go away e g is the static fn callstack somehow causing this problem what do i need to change or is there a bug why my second example doesn t work
either the credentials are dropped completely when switching api specs or preferred the credentials are stored but only for the api they belong to when switching to another one this way when specifying the urls parameter in swaggeruibundle with a specific set of specs user can switch back and forth between specs but is still authorized correctly for each api
just like the required path parameter i expected the formdata parameter to be checked on the form validation red background if the parameter is empty
the path should derive the correct tags from the reference at startup and render in the correct tag group s initially
parameters sends along with a request in query string
yesterday i run this jupyter nootbook successfully
writing 90 layers of batchnormalization should take smaller amount of ram
the model should load
either handle the case where grad values shape tuple is contains none or explicitly throw valueerror if it shouldn t be allowed
the code can run without error
dataset initializes and no segfault when creating next batch
i would expect the dataset class to be imported
load model loads the custom metric successfully either just implicitly or through the custom objects dict
output names to be restored when loading the model and dictionaries for losses to be working when loading the model
similar timeline shown as for e g profile batch 2
it should behave like python3 reading the x characters
when i convert the keras model to the tensorflow model but i get an error above anybody can help me
should be able to import tf broadcast weights in tf version
code should work for batch size of 1
correct progress bar information 100 100 progress bar reasonably short
i would expect the same weights not sure which weights are the right ones
we should be able to create a tensor with buffer
it should work without throwing error
when saving a checkpoint using tf keras callbacks modelcheckpoint save weights only false restoring the checkpoint should also recover the optimizer variables
dense net should have shape information tf tensor lambda 6 identity 0 shape none 10 5 dtype float32
all 3 tests should pass
datasets should stay synchronized by dropping an element from both datasets
it should be possible to free the function calling import tensorflow this is not an issue with any other imports like import logger
i want to make a custom decoder layer with a stateful lstm and a pre net which is a simple dense but i do not want to use sequential or functional api because i want to control with reset states when the lstm states will be reset it always shows the error above how should i give the input shape in this custom layer
repeated tf train calls train for the given amount of steps
i would not expect upgrading the library to slow down data infeed
no long term upward trend in training time
tf print should print out values as was specified in url
in the doc read shoud return the contents of the file as string
i expect the value of the global random seed to be taken into account every time a pseudo random number is generated
one node for all batch sizes
successfully saving a savedmodel with the tf keras layers timedistributed layer
model evaluate should not raise this error after training
python a tf constant 3 4 cpu b tf numpy b 0 1 print a 1 4 print b 1 4
model gets saved
i would expect to see the number of samples batches etc
being able to import from tensorflow core eg from tensorflow core python keras engine training import model with no problem
there should be no error the code works only when histogram freq 0
that code should print identical arrays the latter is correct the former is not
ideally would not like to see the error as currently seeing the error more information along the following line will help a lot determining the root cause 1 see more detailed log on what offending layers and tensors are 2 what exactly is value that is issue in this case batchsize 3 where in code this is occurring do not see any file called builder in tf version source if error in happening elsewhere third party code this case may be nvidia tensorrt closed source making that explicit 4 this case where is it getting 0 for batch size
the efficiency of the code should be same
the exact same code was running fine with tf version with no memory problem
upsampling2d outputs size times the size of the new input
the training commences and finishes normally
as dy dx a2 b i expect result of version for dy dx
in tensorflow version and version it works correctly the model only updates for model1 without any checking for model2
in tensorflow version supposed the model save model default to be saved in savedmodel format
throw a warning when silently rounding maybe convert to float instead of integer if input is a float dtype
consistent behavior at creation time of model and after re loading from a save file
a valueerror should be produced in response to the incorrect input shape whether or not eager execution is enabled
train model distributed without error
enabling eager mode or control flow v2 should not affect the training time or improve it ideally
the evaluate method must provide results close to the fit method especially after 100 epochs
with tensorflow version the tutorial works just fine but with version it runs out of memory this is a small machine that amazon has on it s free tier t2 micro it comes with 1 gb of ram and i m not expecting it to run anything really large but s an ideal machine from a cost perspective to try out tensorflow basics and works just fine with tensorflow version and earlier
zipfiles written with file gfile should be not be corrupt and equal to those written with file other type fd
mkdir should throw an exception if the path exists like the python built in os mkdir url os mkdir does
that code should produce an array 0j 1j 2j no matter how many times it s run
should work with tfx pipeline such as tensorflow transform and tensorflow model analysis
keras should work as described in the api without calling numpy behind the scenes in graph mode and crashing
model fit should be able to infer the shape of the input
use the metadata in tensorboard

galley s probe returns error code and k8s s liveness readiness probe should fail
if istio telemetry pod shows running then 42422 metrics should not be down
the istio operator controller should re attempt reconcile loop after a few minutes 10 when any part of the the previous reconcile loop failed
the command should run display its output and return then the pod should be deleted
the service should expose its metrics to prometheus
that after applying the istio manifests described in the documentation that a functioning ingressgateway would be provided
i see once define qqq message in the logs when the filter first loaded i see envoy on request filter on every authenticated call i get response 100 directly without call to the service
an out of process adapter listening on check events should be called on each service call this expected behavior comes from version version
pod should be deployed with corresponding sidecar
to set the namespace or to provide a way to change the url
installation should proceed
after updating the target state of the namespaceselector via kubectl edit it should keep that state
response status 200 grpc status code 0 grpc message message success
the front css should work properly as istio version
expect the image values to be set with the prefix istio referring to the previous example it should have been istio pilot version instead
the source namespace attribute should be set to the correct value when the pod name includes a dot mixer generated metrics should include the correct source identify instead of unknown
it should be possible to set the email field of the cert manager values the email value does exist in the templates for cert manager but seems to be missing in operator protobuf definitions for values
referenced files should exist
ipv6 traffic can get out from pods
mixer codegen sh to run smoothly when following istio mixer out of process adapter dev guide at url
pods should be able to be created from the replicaset without errors
all control plane pods have request size and limits and liveness and readiness probes
it should respect and override defined readiness probe configurations
arbitrary nr traffic at ingress should not be able to pollute istio generated metrics with junk destination service labels either we should set destination service host to be blackhole or similar or we should exclude request host from the expression for destination service in configuration for ingressgateway or a third better option that someone may have
if a region fails the cluster needs to be able to heal itself once it comes back up
it should connect to internal service over https just like it works with http
i should be able to uninstall without an error
the secret the user creates remains intact the demo secret should not be getting installed when using the default profile
istio tracing deployment should come up successfully
nonzero exit code and possibly a less optimistic message
expected successed response
creating a placeholder secret with temporary values and updating them should result in an update in sds and the ability to access my services letsencrypt certs updates are propagated as expected
at a high level the connections should not be destroyed when the listener map is pushed down to the pod sidecar since nothing material has changed i can see that being achieved in a few different ways but i m not sure what the best approach would be it seems like simplest mitigation here would be to sort list of node serviceinstances url l345 prior to generating listener map so that result is stable even in face of conflicts
all profiles in url should be updated with the release tag operator release would use the new istio release image tag version beta 2
jaeger agent service created
you should be able to view logs in kiali
istioctl shouldn t show the demo auth profile which was removed from the docs
fd less than 7k
installs the in ingress gateway as expected
no errors like this in log
when setting status sidecar istio io port 0 annotation i can still call curl x post version 15020 quitquitquit
istio is installed without the nodeagent
no errors appear in the citadel logs
when the grpc server is stopped i expect the channel to go instantly in a ready state
there should be an envoy endpoint for the service with a subset
resources created by the operator for the control plane and their children resources are all cleaned up when the control plane cr is removed
update of serviceentry including resolution should either work correctly or a validation should prevent from updating the resolution if it is not easy to support mesh proxy state should be consistent
either no egress nor ingress spans should be created or both types of spans should be created
yaml kind servicerole apiversion rbac istio io v1alpha1 metadata name details reviews viewer namespace bookinfo spec rules methods get services details reviews yaml kind servicerole apiversion rbac istio io v1alpha1 metadata name details reviews viewer namespace bookinfo spec rules methods get services bookinfo svc cluster local both serviceroles above should not make service mesh return 403 errors or i expect that the documentation for this end updated i am fine with only supporting exact service name match
sds should reload the updated secrets ssl certs
all pods are running and ready
grafana should show the traffic in out of the box workload dashboard
pilot agent should revive envoy
the sidecar should startup normally and continue to run without running out of file handles

the list is rendered with check boxes for markers as specified for github flavored markdown url task list items extension here is a live example 1 x open the refrigerator 2 put the elephant in 3 close the refrigerator
foo bar bar foo foo bar bar foo
foo bar bar foo
the heading should be normalized when it s not an empty paragraph because headings in text is not allowed by markdown specification a heading should be still created if it s allowed e g empty paragraph or when multiple lines are pasted
x lorem ipsum dolor sit amet x ut enim ad minim veniam
paragraph becomes a bullet list item
no freezes lags should occur
it should undo the action just completed
that it runs the app in dev mode
setting open to true should call trigger the foundation s open method
the clickable area of all icon buttons should be limited to the visible area of the icon button
always respect global formatting
for metabase questions and pulses to work past 4 days of uptime
upgrades should not break existing charts
view the result of the query
metabase to start properly
it should say that i m running the latest version
null or is empty filters are retained on the view these xxx function consistent behavior between view these xxx from the dashboard and the base question
subsequent processing steps should be retained when editing earlier steps i understand that there could be dependencies between these steps but often that s not the case i expected to be able to add a new filter and not lose most of my work notebooks should enable exploratory analysis and allow you to build up a complex series of operations resetting these steps prevents that
date fields should display as december 1 2019
when querying using custom question with joining one or two tables unable to save the result as a question however when queries has no joins even on heavy aggregation iam able to save the question with no issue
you re able to select a question in a reasonable amount of time
see the terminal in fullscreen this works just as expected on the primary monitor
the terminal should start
it should show up prompt after hitting ctrl c many times
was hoping the application would open
successfully inserted
other panes should take up the blank space of the window after i close some panes
the title of the tab should be vs2017 developer cmd
the terminal should enter in full screen mode
the batch file c projects myapp batch build myapp bat will be executed
should be ctrl comma displayed iirc
cursor should following the characters like in cmd exe cmd ime cursor follow url
html doctype html html lang en head t meta charset utf 8 t title title head body t body html
terminal will start powershell with privileged rights that means powershell will run under a privileged context which can be used to managed other computer in a domain
nothing because the index is out of range
set palette index 15 and 16 to the given color
to full screen everything
output a i delete the extra in the following picture manually image url
text is painted and can be copied
1 terminal has to be move to a specific display
windows terminal warns you that powershell cannot be found or perhaps launches a fallback cmd session instead i encountered this issue because some unruly installer erased my path
copied function should be pasted with the same behavior as ctrl v i e pasted code should not be interpreted until the enter key is pressed with the same formatting as the source it was copied from
terminal being drawn correctly image url
the alternate screen buffer doesn t have a scrollback so the ed3 sequence should erase the main scrollback buffer then when you switch back to the main screen there should be no scrollback any more this is how command is implemented in xterm and most of other terminal emulators i ve tested
the ris command should automatically switch back to the main buffer and then clear the main buffer s screen the final 1049 sequence isn t relevent at that point since we are already back in main buffer end result should be a blank screen other than shell prompt i don t think this behavior is actually documented anywhere but that s way it works in xterm and most of other terminal emulators i ve tested
the code format layout is the same as the originate file
i can see which tab is active clearly
i d expect the history window to popup showing the ver command i d just entered
if i scroll up i should be able to see the serial console messages from my embedded target
window scales down correctly window should stay on second monitor
an slow by line scrolling like on conhost exe
windows opened by these powershell commands will get focus and be open over windows terminal
composition input shows up
i should be able to see the tab while dragging
i would expect that all of the tabs are visible next to each other since there is enough room to display them
context menu should be legible with white text on dark background
the overlay resizes with the window size and the about box itself stays centered
current tab closes tab bar disappears other tab is usable
cursor is visible no matter what background color is
as the active tab changes the tab bar should automatically scroll to keep the active tab visible
the external tool appears in the foreground
nothing happens
background should be blue with no black lines screenshot 29 url
i would expect the title bar to use the same color theme as the other apps in the system
the title bar is sized correctly image url
the terminal stays open and might change the size and the resolution depending on the monitor
raising the terminal window should focus the text area no matter how you do it works as expected if you click any other tab than the currently active
resizing the terminal window should change the reported terminal dimensions terminal resize behavior should be unaffected by historysize
every backspace should delete one char
tabs are reordered
rendering works the same as on the main screen buffer
selected text should invert the text colors
this same profile had been used to launch an anaconda powershell prompt and until terminal v version had been working properly
i would expect all of the initial state to be inherited by the alt buffer producing the following results the start text should be on line 9 column 20 i e position before switch to alt buffer margin text should be on line 15 bottom margin tab text should be in column 20 position of tab stop that was set cursor should invisible here s what output looks like in xterm image url
i m used to having a few failures in the and i know a couple of tabtests are blocked but the rest of the tests i would usually expected to pass
app launches as the user i specify
i expect that the password text would be pasted and accepted by git command
the terminal window should be completely contained within the left half of the right display
the windows terminal window should move to the other screen
fast and responsive like it performs in non full screen mode
the line with pt list upgradable should display with the correct text size as in windows console image url i m using the simplified chinese language edition of windows and windows console uses simsun 12pt as default font
can launch new profile in new tab
same amount of lines as in the source and the paste not affecting existing text in unexpected ways
i expect that immediately or after a few seconds at most the ctrl c command interupts the command and scrolling output from the find command in the terminal
the acrylic effect to stay whether or not terminal is in focus
1 outputs of these two seq s shouldn t interleave
the date should show as invalid
javascript import moment from moment const m moment 2019 11 08 console log m d m offset fri nov 08 2019 00 00 00 gmt 0900 x95r undefined const m2 m clone utcoffset 540 asia tokyo console log m2 d m2 offset fri nov 08 2019 00 gmt 0900 x95r 540
the digit 1 representing the first day of the month should be interpreted as the day 01 but moment is interpreting first digit of month as second digit of day
the duration between two moments which are 1 year apart should be a year
there should not be a display of nbsp in the before
autocomplete should select the selected item
by setting a maxwidth overflow hidden and textoverflow ellipsis i expected to see a narrower chip displaying the first x characters of the string then an ellipsis and the delete button should remain visible
expected behavior would be that the position of the dropdown would match the location of the select element and display correctly
import should work as in javascript
it should return the value of the input with the same id as the label s htmlfor
it should be centered
wrapping a modal in withstyles hoc applies styles to the modal
when a key event of type enter is executed i need to change the focus to another input currenly i fix this on a fork implementing a prop for useautocomplete named afteronkeydown and called at the on the the handlekeydown default actions you can see this implementation url but im not sure if this is correct aproach
oninputchange has to be fired only when the textfield has really fired
i think the options can be hidden while loading is set to true
the component property should not throw errors unexplained no overload matches this call
prod build should produce the same result using typescript or js
clicking on a select should expand the list op options attached to teh bottom of the input as in material design guidelines e g url component select
i think it should be switched placehold and icon edit i found related issue if you have a plan fix it i want to do this ius url
shift home should result in all text in the input being selected
inputref focus should not throw
i want to view my component working
when using the component prop the intrinsic html props for the component are passed through to the component without type error
there should be no error
the label animation occures correctly the label move to the top of the textfield
select should lose focus or lose it after clicking outside of it again
input should have autocomplete off according to mdn url disabled is not an autocomplete supported value
dropdown icon is centered align as in with textfield variant contained image url
given the same array of objects i would expect that typing a would filter all objects whose values do not contain a right now all values are still shown because the letter a is present in all objects because of the label property
i expect the dropdown arrow to remain on the line with the cursor
this should allow for styling based on rowdata and should retain the user s pagesize selection even onrowclick
neither should happen if there is no value for the select then the fallback behavior should be to let the text input field render the label inline way it should when there are no listsubheader items or be blank if there is no label at all listsubheader items should not respond to clicks at all as if optgroup was being used if keyboard navigation is used in list they be skipped over as being non selectable
if the snackback autohideduration and onclose props don t change it should call onclose with the timeout reason after autohideduration passes
i assume it should be possible to override the styling of the underline class in input when using the select component but currently it doesn t work this way
when the tooltip s label is updated the label should be re positioned just like it is after moving the mouse away and over again
i would expect all elements to be able to be removed i know that this is not a select react issue because the clearable option is set in the component and it does in fact remove all options
gatsby develop creates a functioning footer player like so image url it s odd really the html in my code editor looks like this image url but the html in my browser after gatsby build has grids containers in it image url
tooltip with html customization should show
in the renderoption prop the second parameter s key inputvalue should be the text the user entered in input field
the element shouldn t respond to the enter key when there s no input
expect handlechange tohavebeencalledtimes 1 passes
pressing kbd title arrow down key kbd on an expanded node that has children should select the first child element calendar
my custom rules should win over the default rules image url
radio button should have a black dot appear on the inside indicating a selection
instead i think height should not be controlled by xs and similar attributes on grid items you probably should use width 100 rather than flex basis when an item is directly under a column container the workaround i am using is to specify the width without the attributes e g html const usestyles makestyles theme xs12 width 100 const comp const classes usestyles return grid container direction column grid item classname classes xs12 test grid
if wrapped in a form element the return key should trigger a submit of that form possibly if the disableclearable prop is set to false then the return key could be seen as clicking the x button to clear field if it is set to true then it shouldn t clear anything
form label doesn t change focus like this for checkboxes
after the user selects the first option the user should be able to click inside the already focused input to trigger popup user should not have to lose focus on input to trigger popup again
the styling and fonts should have worked normally
the expected behavior is that the chip i try to remove is removed
voiceover focus is placed on the first suggestion in the listbox when swiping from the input field the user can easily find suggestions without having to explore by touch refer to authoring practices example url where listbox is placed as a sibling to combobox in this configuration i can find suggestions as expected by swiping forward from input field even without aria owns
at least something to happen now you re just stuck trying to figure out what s happening either default to an empty array of have something logged in console to warn about it e g like react does when changing from uncontrolled controlled
the options should be visible above the dialog if the input is in the dialog
1 i should be able to highlight the x button with the keyboard 2 i should be able to remove chips with enter space when highlighted
the attributes should work the same as in the wai aria design pattern url combobox aria controls should only exist when the listbox is present in dom remove attribute from input whenever listbox itself is removed aria activedescendant should only be set when user is actively navigating in listbox when closing listbox aria activedescendant value should be cleared
the autocomplete component should not assign its own id to the input the id assignment for the input should work same as in vanilla textfield component association between label and input for end user should be intact there should not be an axe error
any number of arguments sent to original onchange of custom inputcomponent should be passed onto the onchange callback
i should be able to use props mydefaultprop in jss callback when user hasn t supplied any value for it
it would be great if i could use a component to fit my needs i was hoping that if i put any plug on enter key in my onchange handler to input but i can t even check if that would work because can t tell if enter is pressed or any other key
the backgrounds of those inputs should have the same borderradius as their input s border without having to use an override image url
the buttongroup should apply the correct styling to all button related children
in freesolo mode onchange should fire on every input key press like a normal textfield does additionally outside of freesolo autocomplete should probably fire onchange when you type out one of the options and blur
the browser state should not be affected by pressing escape
the role used should not cause an accessibility error
the id should be present to match the label s for attribute
all components will be semantic ui besides the button i m trying to render it will not throw an exception
only a single copy of the children will be created if that s the issue console log should be called only once
clicking the delete button for an option removes its own optoin
disableunderline should work no matter if the select is disabled or not
when i pass fabprops to the speeddial component the fab size change and all of the actions should properly align to the fab just like it does with default medium sized fab image url
the page stays on the current scroll position
in all cases the height of the divider component should be calculated as the height of its parent when set to height 100
both first and second header row should be sticky
server side rendering and client side rendering should generate the same class names
to work normaly with custom varaint
you should get assigned the correct value and unit to the lineheight property as it works with other css properties like padding or height
you should be able to apply classes in the same was as other mui components thumb disabled styles
expect datepicker dialog to appear and function the same as when it isn t inside a menuitem with onclick
the tooptip should be shown
speeddialaction s onclick should execute instead of the component speeddial s onclick
test should be able to render a composite component containing fade in true
modal should retain the child element tab index
you should be able to customize the above style classes as described in the documentation for formcontrollabel url css
the component should respect the applied classes to tooltip through the tooltipclasses prop regardless if the labels are always shown or not
ideally a placeholder is shown or space is reserved for where the ad will appear this way the page content doesn t slide down when it loads and it doesn t disrupt the reading experience i understand that disrupting the reader is purpose of ads but i don t think it should be purpose of docs maybe new skeleton component can be used for this
apply only one class muibutton outline in outlined button
select should not call onblur immediately when open true
hovering should not change the position resize the inputs
the draggable element on dragging must not consider the expanded area of ripple
the adornment should be displayed to the left of the arrow or should push the arrow icon and clickable field to left in version version clickable field with arrow icon was pushed to left when a adornment was added
the bottom border should change according to specified styling
the app should load and render components
i think we should consolidate the version to version for both packages
the tooltip should be always centered
when trying to drag the cardactionarea the parent should be able to listen to that event in internet explorer 11 just like it does in chrome
it should be react transition group
no errors keys continues to work
accept the following props without complaining listsubheader component listitem divider
firing event clicks should result in input class privateswitchbase input 24 muiswitch input type checkbox value checked
the initial visible rows of the textfield should grow until reaching rowsmax works as expected in safari and chrome
it should be rendered like chrome firefox is doing image url
it should give focus to the field i guess in the same manner as seen in nativeselect demos
i don t want to be redirected to the old version
i expect to usemediaquery print to match for all printing situations regardless it is started from browser user action or programmatically and it should work on firefox in general in attached demo i expect to have this should be hidden with usemediaquery paragraph to be hidden in all printing situations
the package should not rely on deprecated packages
after resizing the popover should still be positioned as specified in anchororigin and transformorigin
the secondary action should display correctly in line with each list row
the user should be able to set their own role attribute by passing in a prop just like how the message can be set
should return the package
grid children with the xs prop should be and stay fullwidth a workaround for now is to add width 100 style to the grid children i m pretty sure this issue wasn t present in earlier versions
npm starts the react app
isemptyinterface should return true even when strictnullchecks false
transitioncomponent should have type support for
re rendering of select and radio elements when state variable updates
animation rule works with prop based adapting interpolation
the items should have consistent behavior on the initial render and subsequent re renders and also on different browser rendering engines
a typography component with variant h4 should match a box component with fontsize h4 image url
when the dialog is open i can focus unrelated parts of the tab e g in an iframe
the divider should still be there regardless of an backgroundcolor set
material spec kapture 2019 09 19 at 14 42 57 url see url component button type raised
font weight of menuitems shouldn t be affected by the value set for subtitle1 in the theme this started happening after upgrading mui to v4 x it did not happen with mui v3 x
should not be off center
since the component uses forwardref the types should reflect this and typescript shouldn t complain when using the ref prop
the demo would not result in runtime error e g maybe it can show a snack bar message indicating invalid input or we can add validation to the text field
the placement class muitooltip tooltipplacementxxx should correctly reflect the applied placement of the tooltip
the class names are changed according to the generateclassname for both server side and client side
installing non latest versions should not ship both versions of material ui styles i know that this can be resolved by tweaking the webpack configuration to tell it to load the correct version but we would prefer to actually fix this issue solutions i can think of export stylesprovider from material ui core this is the only reason why we have material ui styles as a dependency we import other style related references from material ui core styles such as withstyles muithemeprovider createmuitheme etc this would be our preferred solution unless it s already importable from core and i missed it somehow make styles a peer dependency of core instead of a regular dependency so that one and only one version gets installed by consumers
i would expect the rule counter to reset on a new render of the tree i m pretty sure what s happening is it s render once incrementing the rule counter finishing and then when it starts the next render it s not starting from 0 so solution should be to just create a new creategenerateclassname function after temporary render and provide it somehow i just have no idea how to do that and couldn t find in docs
scrolling on dialog should not trigger swipeabledrawer to slide
1 you are able to use the tab key to move focus to next previous elements 2 in the initially focused input the text cursor is visible
onclickaway to be triggered
the panel should expand when added dynamically
nested theme should be dark
hide tooltip as soon as the trigger element is no more hovered by the cursor and avoid the appearance of a second scrollbar
radio buttons should work as expected
outlined textfields on secondary tabs should have a properly sized notch to contain the textfield s label
grid items should maintain their width when using direction column and no breakpoints
list of options should remain positioned relative to the select
the third line of output should have been the same as the first bookmark b2 should have been a different bookmark and not overwritten b1 the documentation url createbookmark ghidra program model address address java lang string java lang string for createbookmark indicates if a note book mark already exists at address with same category it will be replaced this implies that if two note bookmarks are created with different categories at same address both can exist note that documentation of getbookmarks also implies that multiple note bookmarks can exist at same returns all of book marks defined at specified
if the decompiler generated local variable is larger than the original then the storage size should be appropriately set so there should be no invalid storage message and the new name should be reflected in decompiler pane too instead of an autogenerated name
ghidra is expected to import the file and proceed to disassemble
as per version display the full string with no missing bytes
similar functionality to url askprojectfolder java lang string
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
ghidra identifies the push push ret sequence as an indirect jump ideally flagging the two memory locations as a pointer
i d expect the current program s display to update when a function is executed from a gui component just the same as when the function is executed in a script outside of a gui element
the instructions get decompiled as vmul variants and not as cdp instructions
character sequences should be two entries long especially if made up of pure ascii characters
in the decompiled code enablemaskableinterrupts is supposed to appear after the write to dat io 00a1 not right after
same as version and below
the cursor should be at the last position of previous running
the function to keep its name and be added to the specified namespace
the decompiler analyzing correctly the file
the gui labels have correct space characters between words
use the same playground 1 click navigate no leak 2 click the button on the new page it will set the page background 3 go back initial page is not affected
shorthand properties like margin should not differ from using margin bottom like it works on the web
showing all images well thank yo
when i tap the create component button in the modal view it should render the testcomponent in the modal view

formattedtext should work for label under repeater
i would expect the correct aria to be added in this case it should be aria selected true
no freezing bugginess
rnweb works with latest react
it should alert with text test
textinput should only pass numbers not letters
happy and successful one liner install
update or re install netdata
the release channel in etc netdata environment should be stable
the old version of netdata should die and the new version should start when cron runs netdata updater
by using a tagged netdata version i am expecting to receive update warnings only when a new stable release is out otherwise the exclamation mark becomes rather useless it becomes tempting to ignore it completely knowing that it is there pretty much all the time how difficult would it be to fix this update check behavior
installation phase exists with code 0 which means success
the netdata process should be terminated after some testing with knatsakis there is no proc file system by default in freebsd the uninstaller is being very careful about terminating processes after the pid file is read the proc pid stat is checked to ensure it really a netdata instance that running on freebsd we have no pid file created at run time and proc filesystem not accessible so no process killed a possible solution to add a fall back that detects this situation and asks for user confirmation to run killall netdata
no error 421 messages should be seen as the irc plugin is sending notifications correctly
streaming nodes will be shown as they are in safari and chrome
a successful buil
droped database size goes to 0 at the chart
list of nodes should be display instead it is stuck on loading please wait
the reinstall command should contain all the options that where passed to the initial installer esp auto updates
the netdata updater sh script should remain under etc cron daily it must use the reinstall command variable from environment
an update should only occur if there is a newer version available
i think the current behavior is fine documentation could be improved to reflect it
linear complexity
no segmentation fault but rather an out of memory error during parsing of large inputs
file should just parse like the example2 but with an string escaped backslash
should be parsed as a numeral
program compiles successfully
compilation should succeed as template parameter shall be unlike standard type names e g floatt instead of float to prevent collisions
web worker bundle should execute itself
function that placed on onclick and onsubmit shoud can be read
it should work as when trying to bundle the same file from the cli
since included files are merged into the asset changes made to them should probably invalidate the asset cache and trigger rebuilds
it should allow importing styled components in a parent and child bundle with the same syntax
parcel correctly bundles the code included in vue notification like webpack etc do
should rename static properties within classes properly
the sass files should be compiled normally
no error should occur
parcel build completes successfully
y js should be run once

inactive users should not contribute to such a large increase in memory consumption indefinitely i consider this to be bug since it will crash the application sooner of later one solution would of course be to just increase the aws instance that i use but that s not sustainable as it is already expensive for the amount of users because of how much rocketchat requires and the memory will still keep increasing anyway
this can be corrected in two ways 1 either hide the sidebar containing channel names etc a little before it is hidden in the current case 2 instead of text going behind the options sidebar it should resize with it

able to launch with a readonly filesystem
it should be possible to render pre a component plugin under operation using the styles that i give to it it assumes the colors from opblock body pre
the tf random normal of py2 and py3 with same seed should get the same result
the returned object should be a legal tensorarray instance as is the case when you use only eager mode functions in this case the object type is
to return a dataset iterator
no errors and a correctly saved model
import tensorflow succeeds without the exception
model should compile without errors as in pure keras
training the network doesn t fail
the gradients should exist for these layers
there should not be any delay or at least no perceivable

all list methods should be supported for defining nested list of layers
the progress bar should report the total number of elements infered from the training dataset not from the validation dataset last line in example output should be 78 1024 not 78 128
i would like fit generator to complete even when i use my custom callback
according to the documentation url given a list of tensors or ragged tensors with the same rank r r axis here r 1 and axis 0 so the preconditions should be fulfilled
they should behave identically
tf keras callbacks tensorboard set model should only close those writers that will not be needed any longer
metrics should be computed in any case to give insights about the training as it is based on model output and true value given by the data loader sequence
model training time should be closely equal in both the cases i mentioned
the expected behavior is that the above snippet will not return errors log attached below potential solution check the input x in dtype method in tensorflow core python keras backend py happy to contribute if this is helpful
when using the same gs path with
data transferring overlaps with computing in order to speed up training
from the keras documentation it should work
i expect the interpreter to be able to resize all the tensors below you can find the simple model i ve built to reproduce this issue what i ve notice is that without the concatenate op allocation works correctly
i suppose that softmax cross entropy with logits v2 should work just as softmax cross entropy with logits
autocastvariable assign should return an autocastvariable variable instead tf variable so that the dtype is preserved reedwm is this intended behavior
well increasing ccuracy and no error basically
i expected the converted function to be invariant of the optimiser instance
the expected behavior is that the model performs the inference without any need to be compiled and returns the result in fact this behavior is meet when model is saved with keras format model h5 and loaded
should execute in a comparable time to a dense tensor
allow square brackets in the checkpoint path or fail at checkpointmanager creation if directory parameter contains disallowed characters
i expect it to not crash when running
i would like to have the training metrics logged as well
do not remove checkpoints that are not owned by a checkpointmanager instance in the code below i expected to have checkpoints 1 2 4 5 at the end instead only 4 and 5 survived
result should not depend on eagerly mode on or off
we should be able to train the model when restored from savedmodel
model is loading and i can use the pre trained model for online service
the output should be following array 0 1 j 0 0 j 0 j j 1 1 1 dtype complex64 i got correct output for following versions of the function tf function def fn t 1j np eye 8 dtype np complex64 return tf convert to tensor t and when tf function is removed def fn some variable tf cast version complex64 t 1j np eye 8 dtype np complex64 return convert to tensor t and when i use small value for eye function def fn some variable cast version 1j eye 7 dtype return convert to tensor can you reproduce my error
make sqrt functions return only the expected behavior and remove the clip by value
the benchmark with the second package should be faster than the first one
i would expect the output to be random instead the first and second value are always repeated every fourth element
the gradients should be calculated well regardless of how many times we call the layer within a tf function
the unit test should run successfully
code should run without error
the model loaded from savedmodel should keep the named inputs
this should not fail in any case except if i am using the custom objects argument wrong the documentation could be a little expanded on that matter by the way
the moving variance should not be nan
tpu training should run similarly to gpu training without errors in this case
to be able to create savedmodel directory
compile the lstmcell code correctly
model load weights osp join model dir model should load the data without problems
model is saved successfully
model saving should not fail
using the c api or the original source code the configuration of gpu must be the one defined with code i presume issue is with c api because training in c works on gpu
with mask zero true anytime there is an input of 0 in one of the time steps the output should be same as the previous time step s output
i expect no error i suppose can be used in exactly the same way as
i expect a example which is possible to execute
trace shows complete function names at least and signatures optional or even better layers to which those activities events belong
k can be used as 1 d tensor
no sigus should be raised
algo installs without error
i expected the script the script to return without error

on is displayed in the status line and the cursor stays where it is in the buffer
nothing is selected when on the first and on the b when on a only ba is selected the r is missed
no error regardless of the terminal column size
the text selection should continue to the end of the line
all c files are selected
the statusline should not flicker while scrolling
redraw does not affect the behavior
the cursor jumps onto the last character z
i don t know if it is by design but it doesnot look so reasonable
windows 10 is shipped with a scp by default and this version of scp is ready to parse the standard windows file path format according to the source of netrw netrw vim 2220 url l2220 which eventually change the windows format path to unix like form just before the execution of scp command this doesn t make any sense actually because modification at netrw vim 2220 url l2220 masks previous careful work on modifying file path by testing whether user is in cygwin mode or not netrw vim 11518 url l11518
the motion should only bring the cursor onto the on lines 1 3 and 6 as start of class start of method end of class respectively instead it also will land on the on line 2 which is a java annotation and should not be reached by m and m motions
two tabs in the tab line b and c
corner radius define on the apptheme affect all the dialog corner radius thanks
the content of the dialog should be accessible no matter how small the actual dialog height is if necessary the whole dialog could be scrollable and buttons would be accessible by scrolling

tab size flickers in response to input in shell in other shells the tab resizes frequently in response to a change the title text to adapt to the size of it it seems like zsh has some way detect a maximum size and truncates it but not before wsl has rendered the update even other shells that don t flicker adaptive behavior seems very strange e g when i change directories it resizes tab causing frequent visual distraction as ux is reorganized each time shell title changes i am not sure if this behavior is intentional but i think having a fixed consistent tab size is a much better user experience then trying adapt title as changes for example way chrome works is pretty sensible use larger until there are too many tabs then shrink them all but each should probably always be same or at least not change while someone s actively using shell as would be common when someone has title that reflects current directory which changes often windows terminal flicker url

i m not sure if this was as designed or a bug but it seems inconsistent so i went with a bug when viewing the edges in the graph view there are inconsistent line weights probably 60 or 70 percent of the edges seem to be displayed with a very light font the other 30 40 percent have a darker line weight i can t determine any reason why sometimes weights are darker vs lighter darker line weights are ok lighter line weights are very light and difficult to see if your vision is not perfect even darker have pretty thin weight but extra light color along with thin weight make thin lines fairly difficult to see i put few screen shots below to demonstrate this bug at first thought different jump conditions determined if edge lines were dark or light but it doesn t appear be that case

when using the mixer zipkin adapter with jaeger collector as zipkin service mixer sends its generated spans to the same jaeger collector instance it seems like the zipkin reporter is reusing the tcp connection to jaeger collector as long as possible this makes it hard to horizontally scale jaeger collector as at most one instance is used per mixer instance even worse when multiple mixers and collectors are in play collectors can go unused a possible solution might be customizing client used in zipkin adapter s reporter url l91 to break up connections regularly

i working on a new ionic 4 app that is based on the sidemenu starter template we have members on the team that specialize in ux and accessibility and my app was recently tested and i got some feedback it was pointed out that the component used for the left pane ion menu has an aria landmark role of omplementary and that this would mislead users of screen readers they would likely assume section of app is informative yet non essential content about current page which it is not its function is navigation critical for usage of app as a whole i was asked to change aria role from omplementary to avigation which accurately reflects functionality as you can see from my repo url on stackblitz i was unable to do so when adding role avigation to ion menu it simply gets overwritten role omplementary

cross cluster calls ignore virtualservices in destination clusters ex an in mesh call from servicea clusterx to serviceb clustery routes directly to serviceb instead of using virtual service rules configured for serviceb this appears to be an artifact of the envoy configuration in the istio ingress gateway which routes global requests directly to envoy clusters which translates a service in k8s the virtualservice configuration is written the ingress envoy s other normal gateway configurations as dynamic routing rules ex if i connect virtual service a gateway on port 80 virtualservice config becomes dynamic routing rule config on port 80 envoy proxy this doesn t happen for global even if i directly connect virtualservice global gateway istio creates for multi cluster routing

after updating from version to version e mail header and subject are changed the used default variable user is not set anymore
expected behavior is low memory usage as in pytorch version alternatively a way to control caching e g something which disables caching or something like torch cuda clear caches but for cpu as i understand high memory usage happens because allocations are cached which makes sense for fixed shapes but does not work well for variable shapes binning shapes is possible as a work around but has a noticeable performance penalty and memory usage is still higher
sometimes when scrolling on an ion content element not to slow and not to fast the ionscrollend event is fired twice once shortly before scroll ends and once the scroll really ends while this is not that problematic is runs the internal ionscrollstart function twice and hence two times the watchdog and timer is running it this function here in ionic core src components content content tsx line 276 url l276 this leads to a high cpu usage on slow android devices hence scrolling interrupted shortly which makes scrolling feeling not native

os any node npm version node 10 npm 6 related to url that issue was specifically for default but this issue applies to all reserved words in my case i have an http request utility library that s used in some of my components that library default exports an object with http methods e g js export default get post delete and as in the example the delete is breaking the build there is a workaround if you assign the export to a variable and default export that variable then babel plugin export metadata will only attach metadata to variable and not its keys url l114 l119 reason it breaks when you directly object is because babel plugin metadata treats objectexpressions differently it will go through each of keys and attach metadata them url l121 l129 but file cannot take reserved words as identifiers since end result isn t valid javascript url l5 l17 p s thanks for all work on docz it s a great tool

version version elastic cloud latest chrome latest chrome elastic cloud the reason why this fails is that a query with no fields in it gets converted to a multi match query which does a term query on the index under the hood therefore searching for a term my t with the asterisk at end old lucene syntax always worked for case described above as it s always using query string which does all of necessary wildcard and analysis steps needed

the electron version of node gets patched to set electron run as node 1 in the environment of the child process url it s quite common though for code to pass in process env as an option to child process fork worker farm does this for instance in this case this line changes the actual process env for current not a copy url l21 initially this is harmless however next time any new is spawned it will inherit current environment including electron run as node even if it should be run as electron causes all sorts of malfunctions i suspect solution will be to ensure we modify a copy of environment we have been passed for instance changing when forking a child script we setup a special environment make atom shell binary run like upstream node if options env options env object create options 1 something like when forking child script we setup special make atom shell binary like upstream if options object create else object create 1 workaround callers can explicitly pass copy worker farm supports instance reported by several people here url version v version operating system macos version windows 10 1803 last known working n

that is all i have i hope this helps or you can help me i have ipcmain in main js and i have ipcrenderer that only seems to work in html files want to write simple classes and be able to send some data to the main process via the ipcrenderer feel this is a bug but am probably using it wrong my example is have a rclient js file which contains a class and some global variables and export this module create it like so in main js rclient new rclient version 23333 secret in this file attempt bring the ipcrenderer with intentions of using ipcrenderer send console output consolelogs then catching that send from rclient js the main via ipcmain on client toconsole event logs send html page here via webcontents why doesn t work what am doing wrong can provide minimal code examples electron version version operating system windows 10 1803 last known working electron version
i m seeing this on dedicated graphics and in a virtual machine i don t have a machine with integrated graphics to test on unfortunately i strongly suspect there s a relationship between the findings in url and this issue electron version version also affects all tested versions of version x and version x operating system windows 7 x64 windows 10 x64 last known working electron x
i m using manual distribution for this i v just download version from url

i m not entirely sure you will agree that this is a bug but afaict the api seems to replicate what the underlying windows api provides so i assume it s an oversight that this parameter in particular is missing especially considering how problematic it can be for applications to have c windows system32 as their cwd electron version all according to docs tested in version version operating system windows
electron version version beta 7 operating system windows 10 last known working electron version unknown

this is a serious accessibilty issue for me i first raised this issue with the visual studio code team who told me to report it to y all i have had chronic tendonitis for years which makes mouse and trackpad usage extremely painful after no more than 5 minutes of usage so it really isn t an option i switched to a pen tablet years ago and never looked back however two of my most important apps gitkraken and vs code have had increasing amounts of problems with my pen input vs code has become nearly unusable bc i can no longer drag scroll sliders with my pen right click actions in gitkraken have become highly erratic firing late or not at all and apparently giving nonsensical position data because the context menus such actions are supposed to summon appear in random locations nowhere near where the click event occurred operating system windows 10 1803 ubuntu version x64 last known working electron version don t know but it s gotten worse in the last 6 months or so on every electron app use

given the above limits i don t know if anyone will be able to given the context tell me what the solution is but i m hoping people with more experience can point out how to debug this issue ideally to identify what s causing the problem as currently i ve little info to work with electron version v version operating system macos version last known working electron version n a using browserify

the demo uses electron 4 but the issue persists with the version beta electron version version latest version beta operating system all last known working electron 3 x
4 x bug is likely due to the pr of another bug that has been fixed 17264
if electron is supposed to behave this way not being able to load apps from a remote file structure served over http then the help message should be change to reflect this if it is supposed to run the same way as if the file were local then there is a bug electron version v version operating system ubuntu version windows 10
the issue is similar to this mac specific issue url i thought i d open this in case the fix for that issue does not cover windows i ve noticed that on windows electron s isvisible method always returns true when minimizing the window electron version version operating system windows 10 10240 vm last known working electron version not sure

it used to work with electron 2 and 3 still works with latest does not work with beta or nightly 6 i ve already checked url but in m case i run at dom ready already so should be fine i guess also this console log mesage get triggered just before the call to executejavascript javascript window webcontents on dom ready console log dom is ready window webcontents executejavascript etc etc etc electron version v version beta 6 operating system linux arch x86 64 kernel version 1 last known working electron version v
build works fine locally but not when on shared network drive
it probably does the same thing if the gpu is blacklisted rather than explicitly disabled it probably does the same thing in basic mode too
observed on machine with dual gpus although i don t think the issue is caused by that this is the only windows 7 machine i have available possibly related 17448 includes the output on windows 10
there is a possibility this is by design if so we may want to rename the api method to make it clear ie
i heard and saw similar problems earlier but this one seems to be different
i need the accessibility permissions to simulate a keyboard event using robotjs url sometimes the app seems to have lost its accessibility permissions and i have to delete and add the app again to the accessibility list this bug does not seem appear on other electron apps like vscode slack skype maybe it has something do with signing thanks
i think this might have something to do with either a electron not handling the closing of sockets correctly anymore or b the garbage collector kicking in and cleaning up the socket resource which makes electron crash then again that is purely speculation on my end
also tested this with current google chrome version version the problem does not appear there may be related to 13934 but i encountered this with current electron versions version und version x i can consistently reproduce this with my gist
this was first raised as an issue on vs code but it looks like it s an electron bug url

no thanks what happens if you skip this step someone will read your bug report and maybe will be able to help you but it unlikely that it will get much attention from the team eventually the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos please remember that issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority the person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway please be respectful of their time you might figure out issues yourself as you work on extracting it thanks for helping us help
happy to create one but i don t think it s particularly helpful in this case
you can try to reproduce the this issue on my repo url
see description in to reproduce this can be done on a any existing docusaurus setup or newly created one
i think this issue is clearly explained and straight forward to be able to reproduce if you still need me to create a separate repo with the issue reproduced please let me know

calling resetform with new values in a submit handler does not change values or dirty state software version s formik version rc 13 react version might be worth noting that mobx is involved
my supported formats image jpg image jpeg image png audio mp3 video mp4 video mov but when i select this formats cmx sketch cdr validation doesn t work software version s formik version react version browser chrome npm version operating system mac os
when submitting first form errors contains value2 which placed in next form and vice versa required value value required undefined formik initialvalues value1 onsubmit alert submit1 form field name value1 validate required button type submit submit1 button errors value2 required form formik formik initialvalues value2 onsubmit alert submit2 field name value2 validate button type submit submit2 button errors value1 formik software version s version rc 8 react version
fields with validate don t get marked as touched so the error isn t shown as you can see below email is yup validation and age field validation props values email errors age age is required email required touched email true issubmitting false isvalidating false submitcount 1 dirty false isvalid false initialvalues validateonchange true validateonblur true image url software version s formik version react version yup version
with value image url with empty value image url the field is included with an empty value software version s formik version react version typescript version browser chrome official build 64 bit npm yarn yarn operating system macos
when i try to return a react element as an error in a formik validate method i receive a typescript error saying that it must be a string ts type element is not assignable to type string 2322 error tsx 6 3 the expected type comes from property name which is declared here on type formikerrors values it looks like it s an easy fix by changing the in types tsx from string to any software version s formik version react version typescript version browser n npm yarn operating system ubuntu
field s render props contain only field and form props it misses any other props passed to field if used via render or children props it actually affects both field and fastfield software version s formik version
i m running version and the touched shape of one of our form looks like the following screen shot 2019 01 15 at 9 46 28 am url upgrading to version seems to have changed its shape and it doesn t only store booleans for fields anymore but looks like it now has the same data as values screen shot 2019 01 15 at 9 44 26 am url software version s formik version react typescript browser chrome npm yarn npm 6 operating system macos
in the demo click the add my address button a new property should be added to testobj new value of myaddress 222 place the new property should be displayed below addresses the form should be dirtied and become valid submit button should be clickable issue appears to that when copying values to initial values and back on reset it is not being deep copied so object is a reference copy this means when value is changed saved initial value is changed making it look like form still isn t dirty when initial values are compared to current values check if it dirty i think problem manifesting on formik tsx 560 where dirty value calculated i was able get it working as expected by adding a clonedeep whenever was set initialvalue or initialvalue was set software version s formik version react version typescript version browser chrome npm yarn npm operating system macos
it adds an empty only with a field with the name of the form field so you cannot really have more complex objects in my case there are three levels values field1 fieldn field1 fieldn field1 fieldn software version s formik version react version typescript browser chrome version npm yarn operating system mac
formik sets field1 name and field2 name when any of the two values is entered the change handler is not called once for each field but in fact called only for the correct field but ends up changing both fields at the same time behavior also occurs if i change a fastfield to a field software version s formik version react version alpha 8af6728 react native version typescript browser npm yarn yarn operating system mac os

quite serious anyone checking the tooltip is left wondering if the filter works properly
it is blocking some users
this is blocking all usability of the custom question involving a join thanks for any assistance and if there s anything i can do to help please let me know
blocking your usage of metabase entirel
this makes ga unusable with metabase and i reverted to using ga directly
it s mainly an oddity and a little confusing for the user putting the question together since he thought he was doing something wrong and didn t know why it was doing this
this doesn t prevent us to use the different kind of charts but as ordering is a basic functionality i think it is an essential thing to work none
this is a display issue only doesn t prevent the usage of the feature but looks weird as a quick n dirty fix i have added overflow x hidden to the right flex column which solves the render problem but of course truncates long question names and hides not compatible question triangle warning icon i think it is a quite easy to fix problem as will not involve any backend change looks like a frontend only css problem
well what i assumed to be a trivial exercised invalidated all existing reports and questions that s pretty severe though i could take a backup of the metabase internal database to undo the damage so at least it s not crippling
this is impacting users especially external users seeing dashboards as embedded pages in larger applications quite heavily because they cannot access the raw data when needed this might have already been described in 3399 although in a much more unclear version i suggest closing 3399
severe can t embed dashboards the parameters work fine when using a public insecure iframe url
blocking some user
we have upgraded on our main server so this is now blocking our users from making reports
pretty severe for me as it makes query builder entirely unusable running on amazon ecs docker container orchestrator on aws the data of metabase itself is saved to hbase no dedicated database server is hbase file corrupted i don t know how to check if the database is broken native query editor loads successfully i can list edit existing questions or try x ray but can t create new questions
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously add any other context about the problem here
see forum thread for real database queries url not sure if it is related to 980
i would rate this as a blocker most of our users download large datasets via metabase because of this bug a very small set of users are able to block the entire metabase installation we are left with 2 options either to significantly increase the size of instances or move this functionality our metabase na
some users need to refresh a dashboard for a complete result the same error appears in single questions
i have a lot of problems because the h2 have 11gb size
this isn t a blocking issue since there is a work around to it e g convert the date as date however for non sql expert users this is an additional obstacle that prevent them from building there own dashboards we as a data team have been owner of the dashboards so far we would like now to consider metabase as a self service bi platform by giving our colleges the ability to build their own dashboards thanks
i am just evaluating metabase for the moment
hight some of my graphs are broken the problem apears when i update to v version from v version
annoying there s a larger question here about how to handle databases that don t have tables mazameli any thoughts
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously this issue is blocking a minor release pie url
blocking our ability to add any new questions or dashboards or modify existing ones which is having a fairly large impact
blocking some users especially enterprise customers who cannot upgrade their browser after some time ie will also complain about a long running script that is blocking the browser and offer to terminate execution of the script
this is blocking some users and frankly making me look bad
very important since we need to answer our stack holders on the add any other context about the problem here
i would say this is of high severity as it was working in version version and stopped working in the new query builder rendering the drill down options useless
monthly aggregation is a very common aggregation used we may not roll out metabase to non technical users with this bug present i e people who won t write sql
blocking an upgrade
we can switch to tables but it is neither trivial nor informative in all the cases
slightly annoyin
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely this feature is very useful and negatively affects our users experience add any other context about the problem here
users cannot see existing reports they can however switch to table view but it is not trivial that the data is actually there
quite annoying bug i had to rollback my installation add any other context about the problem here
all formatting has disappeared for percentages which makes tables and tooltips unreadable quite severe indeed
pretty severe we can t search anymore
i think it s a major issue
i think it s a big deal and some users would prefer to wait before upgrading to v version to not break their dashboards ps metabase is amazing thank you for it
is this sometimes it works
high it is providing end users with inaccurate data that they believe is accurate this occurs whether you view the question or view it in a dashboard or an embedded dashboard it doesn t appear to be related to any specific date ranges
blocking severe
there is no way for me to change from to r in all my tables i m from south africa and we work in currency rand symbol r currency code zar
slightly annoying add any other context about the problem here
low large docker containers are generally a bad practice and should be avoided where possible
high showing inaccurate information and reducing user confidence in the system since the database value for the record is 4 30 pm the table shows records between 4 pm and 4 59 pm for which there are 2 4 30 pm 45 when clicking to view these records metabase applies a filter of time hour of day is as shown in screenshot 2 it seems like way table is filtered grouped is different than filters when viewing records
it is blocking permissions management
blocking some functionality that prevent us to adopt the tool entirely
seems like it s friends with 1001
we are unable to load query or do anything with reports reliant on bigquery data sets
not blocking but it should be part of the feature to allow join data this is working fine for basic metrics fields from join data are included
not very severe but is blocking our team
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely i consider as a very severe bug since i can t use the latest metabase and i m forced to use v version due to this issue so not updates are applicable beyond v version for me note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously note that metabase v version works without issues with its embedded h2 database the issue is with amazon aurora mysql database aurora mysql database i use is empty with charset utf8 and collation utf8 general ci older version of metabase v works without any issues with same mysql setup on amazon aurora but are not working at all
blocking a dashboard metric that is requested
annoying makes some plots difficult to read or in need of having to be reworked split into separate questions
we use metabase to send reports directly to partners automatically via pulses this issue causes the formatting on those reports to break which means that our internal staff has to format them manually before sending them out ensure they follow the agreed upon structure this consumes partnership management time on low level excel tasks and creates a confusing ux for our partners
annoyance users can t search for tables by the names they know them by this limits the usefulness of the improved search function
annoying could be remedied by restarting instances
we just upgraded and our coworkers are going to want to read documentation on all the new features
tabs is not working for all the audit pages
it s very annoying for anyone who needs search in russian how does russian layout look ru layout url
low medium it means i have to rewrite my existing report queries none
not being able to save the field is not good add any other context about the problem here
frankly speaking it is difficult for me to assign a severity level to this issue as it is annoying but at the same time can be bypassed by either using sql question or count of distinct values partial workaround metric
i could imagine this being a fairly substantial blocker to new people getting up to speed on notebook mode particularly since the sample dataset field lists are much smaller than our production database s hopefully this is an easy fix though
p1 we can t upgrade use this version until this is fixed
this is a big issue as it renders the whole binning feature useless and grid map as example can t be used
this bug is mainly affecting world map based visualizations and affect dashboards which affects end user experience the workaround is available but it has its own issues for which i m opening another issue making world map based visualizations completely unusable i have done some detailed analysis of the bug and have identified the root cause of the problem world json has 100k points to be rendered on ui and it is taking a lot of time to render those points i found out some nice work done regarding geojson datasets for world map that are available and are rendering a similar view in under 10k data points when i switched packaged json with some geojsons available over internet url map started rendering in less than 5 seconds think proper solution would be to replace existing json with an optimized version as far as workarounds are concerned can add load geojsons from admin panel but issue with this workaround is that non builtin geojsons keeps on repeating more than once upon rendering which looks really odd confuses end users m thinking about opening a separate issue for that as well let me know if m missing something over here
blocking usage of metabase stacked bar chart visualization type some existing reports are affected there are potentially related or similar issues mentioned previously but they seem to lack details and response url url url please advise if this is not a bug and or there is a known workaround
preventing usage of the custom expressions for some fields can work around with native sql queries but annoying i d guess it s going to impact other field names ath use key words but i don t have any handy to try it out
produces a lot of error logs will cause issues with new shared public urls pulses etc we can work around using ip address or simply the server name but it s less than ideal and won t be an option in all environments
annoyance makes that search dialog largely useless but can still navigate to the question
from the forum version preview thread url
it prevents me from using metabase entirely because most of the functionality is broken due to this error
blocker our customers rely on the ability to export and review their own data there is no limit issue when exporting from individual questions only embedded dashboards
middle severity
no severity just peculiar
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely annoying note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously add any other context about the problem here
critical i can t see any of my data and i can t work around it
minor ux annoyance i love metabase
this issue is blocking new users access through ldap only we are currently manually adding them to bypass it please note that the ldap auth was working correctly on a previous version v version snapshot built on 2018 10 29 the issue started after we updated to recent versions
for now it s just annoying but to help give bi tools to our non technical users this will cause frustration and difficulty we can work around it by writing the query directly but that defeats the purpose and elegance of using the metabase ui i am able to run these queries with raw sql so there is some constraint that metabase is enforcing to prevent this result specifically i ve run the query select b bar a from a inner join b where a foo b foo honestly i m not 100 sure what constraint is exactly being violated is it related query being generated or underlying relationship that metabase expects or fact that one of my tables actually a view or something else entirely
i m comfortable working around this or simply using the bigquery ui although i imagine it d be a blocker for less technical users
we upgraded from version because there was another problem with saving dashboards and we ended up with an unusable installation for 3 weeks until we finally co related the problems with an upgrade this issue affects all our users company of 100 people where 40 people daily use metabase add any other context about the problem here
annoying for users must save twice to change date range
low severity just a bunch of bug fixes we want to talk advantage of e g cannot edit segments in version we ve successfully upgraded in the past related but not related url
not a big issue no loss of capability just a visual bug
blocking some dashboards that are desired to be consumed at the executive level and throughout the organization but not blocking metabase usage entirely

with the changes in next cssbaseline now adds a line height property to the body this has a profound effect on any span elements being used since inline elements can only have a line height if a parent element in this case the body doesn t specify one the caption variant renders as span which means it is no longer possible to set line height for this particular typography variant workarounds you can specify typography variant caption component p you can set display block either in typography definition for theme or as an inline style tech version material ui v version beta1 react version browser chrome

previously in 3 x x we were setting the height of the textfield manually via style classes when we wanted to have the height of the textfield to show 6 rows worth of information even if there was no text entered in field now in version alpha 8 textfield calculates a height internally based on rows rowsmax rowsmin props and assigns it to style prop on underlying textarea element this style takes precedence over css classes so it is no longer overridable so my understanding is that now if we set set minrows textarea that is created will have its height set based on that tech version material ui v version alpha 8 react version browser chrome typescript

the project i am using it in is not using just material ui so it sits along side some other libraries some ui related so i appreciate that this might not be a normal case i can confirm the issue goes away once i delete the babelrc files note this only happens with tests am able to run the actual components and everything else works as expected but testing is crucial so need to have this resolved somehow

i think nested themes should extend existing theme as much as possible otherwise you end up pretty much defining new theme all over again i came across this issue because of action colors we have a navigation bar that has dark background color and uses shades of white as action and hover colors this is completely the opposite of the rest of the application where the background is white and needs shades black to indicate action states i think problem stems from this line url l91 instead i think using a deepmerge would be a lot better m happy to provide solution provided you agree that it s right one tech version material ui v version react version

i have developed a more general use component for creating consistent look and behaviors and this component was more or less a formcontrol component like what s in the sandbox i pretty much have now set the shrink property on the inputlabel to always be true now because that ensures the label never overlaps however component looses placeholder effect inputlabel does when there no value selected tech version material ui v version react version browser n a etc

my use case is a little more complex than the above example but this demonstrates the base problem my element moves when clicking but the tooltip remains visible there s no easy way to dismiss it other than creating a completely controlled component and handling mouse events manually there may be some cases where dismissing on click isn t the desired behavior so it may be preferable to have this as an option e g dismissonclick true or exposing a call that can dismiss tooltip e g this ref tooltip close tech version material ui v version react v version browser chrome 68

i don t see this issue as a major blocker since consumers of snackbar can always customize the positioning using classes also you can pass a numeric string e g 10 or 10px to anchororigin vertical and anchororigin horizontal i think the most important thing right now is that the docs and the typescript definitions should be consistent with runtime behavior should we update docs and ts definitions to indicate that numbers can t be used if so i ll definitely submit a pr or should we actually implement support for passing numbers to anchororigin

image url i get something like that babelrc package json cli command i only use babel preset vue js presets vue i haven t had the time to test this and this is purely a hunch but i suspect that cssnano might not be able to handle attribute selectors that don t have an sign in them
image url babelrc package json cli command please refer to url babelrc seems to be ignored on the root project i think once parcel stops skipping it we ll be able to fix this unexpected token behavior by using some custom transforms 1 one repo for the actual app 2 another repo for the lib which will be linked by the app 3 still not sure why but some libraries such as typography js url installed by lib are breaking compiler and more an attempt to fix it by using a custom babelrc on root doesn t seem work because seems that parcel is skipping it software version s parcel version node version npm yarn yarn version operating system macos high sierr

rxjs version version implementation of coldobservable seems to operate with subscriptions in some strange way i would expect it to call its own subscribe and then return a wrapper around unsubscribing somehow i don t understand what it actually does but it looks to me that it s a hack that breaks sometimes
the current workaround used for the test is to explicitly specify the type parameter ts expectobservable e1 pipe first string x x s d tobe expected instead of using t as the type for default parameter it ought to be possible to use another type parameter that extends t something like this maybe ts export function first t d extends t predicate null defaultvalue d monotypeoperatorfunction etc

this is an issue for my project i wish to be able to use my own jwt based authentication service using a policy actually users permissions or whatever does the jwt check seems to be a mandatory middleware that cannot be skipped in case someone would be interested there is a workaround to use a custom jwt validation create custom jwt auth middleware and make sure it executes before users permissions perform your own validation then replace the authorization header with new one built for strapi the payload should contain an id field idealy pointing strapi user record id if your route is not declared as public drawback you ll have filter out every route on which you don t want your middleware run it s best use policies when possible

see below your browser and the version chrome version your operating system windows 10 svelte version version it s not a big issue but the current behavior seems surprising or counter intuitive non
very it breaks apps without a single warning or error this means that the more complex nested your app is the harder it is to troubleshoot any app that relies on url params to update the store is highly susceptible to this bug i ran into it with sapper as well
chrome console just says running svelte compiler version version and stays silent in relation to any errors windows 10 chrome version version official build 64 bit low
in the example code given below you should see the error bar is not defined when the baz export is at the bottom of script and you should see it fixed when baz export is moved to top not high since it s easy to work around you could also fix by removing destructuring syntax
can be worked around

svelte version medium low ish probably this seems to occur in a fairly specific situation quite possibly this will be fixed by 3539 but i wanted a record of this repro anyway
generated code is wrong for instance when using debug paneindex it generates this image url paneindex is the index from each loop no errors from the compiler only compiled code gives an error svelte version version compared to every single version above medium project is live with over 100 daily ccu having smooth animations is very important in my project i would ve loved to have latest transition animations fixes which currently look a bit janky in version this compiler issue prevents me from upgrading
svelte v version the problem is not critical because there are working alternatives doesn t affect something important
svelte version version repl annoyance the error mentioned in the title easily worked around by declaring the let variable outside of the reactive block js let x x but what s more annoying is that it forces to duplicate code to compute value once for manual declaration and once for reactive block it can be cumbersome in some cases
svelte version any rollup version version or higher moderate the code doesn t break anything but it is bad to be including it this is the rollup pr that changed this url there is apparently a list of known globals that won t be assumed to have side effects but htmlelement is apparently not among them i don t know whether this should be considered something to be improved in rollup or whether we could doing something else on our end to not trip this

svelte version this doesn t block but is severe since any such comparisons made will be wrong and this could break a number of pre existing components
chrome v76 windows 10 svelte v version see repl not too important as it is a corner case but additional context explains why fixing it may be useful i discovered this bug because i was trying to create page transitions in sapper but could not find a elegant way of doing so which resulted in me trying this workaround and finding this bug the main problem is that there is no way of adding a transition when a slot changes unless you add transitions to the slot contents which is problem in sapper because there isn t an easy way of wrapping every page component to include intro and outro transitions fixing this bug would allow the parent component to add any kind of transitioning slot elements
see repl see repl this is very specific and important to the project i am working on because the spread operator is allows me to only set the variables that i want to override the defaults for if i have to explicitly set each prop then i will end up overriding defaults that do not want

conditionally rendering the swagger ui in a react application when rendering the swagger ui per the recommendations in url and per the sample repo url for create react app causes a memory leak conditionally rendering just swagger ui s root div rather than a component that creates swagger ui instance in componentdidmount is not a viable alternative because on subsequent re render will not be displayed which is expected this is pretty common use case in react so it seems like there should be either way for parent app to clean up s memory perhaps componentwillunmount or b should handle this case itself somehow i ve forked demo of using with create react app and added toggle button to demo memory leak here url

the problem is in the fact that sequential layers does not return the inputlayer to quote comments from the method python def layers self historically sequential layers only returns layers that were added via add and omits auto generated inputlayer that comes at bottom of stack trackable manages attributes and does filtering over it problem is that if inputlayer was added manually with a specified input shape then it is an error not to serialize it because then following do not know what input shape is workarounds if instead of inputlayer you add input shape to dense layer it works however input dtype cannot be specified in this way and when you pass tf int32 on using an required in functional api tf keras serialized in model and funnily as a solutions when serializing a sequential model all need to be serialized no filtering of performed have i written custom code as opposed using a stock example script provided tensorflow

i would consider this an anaconda problem if only it happened at all times however what i find weird and why i suspect it might be a tensorflow issue is that it only occurs when input dataset size is large enough in this example the error pops up when n is 8193 or higher no error when n is 8192 or lower this threshold value different in my original project where i first faced the problem there it happened when dataset array length was 100k 1 or higher while working fine with 100k long dataset apologies if this irrelevant to tensorflow and indeed an anaconda issue p s adding kmp duplicate lib ok true does silence the error have written custom code as opposed to using a stock example script provided in tensorflow

if the two assignments use different list names for example a and b a is correctly assigned a value but b is also xa8c wrongly xa8c assigned a value if 1 let not from heredoc else let b trim end from heredoc end endif echom echom b outputs not from heredoc from heredoc the issue can be simplified further if 0 let list trim end end endif echom list the test fails so list should not be assigned anything and yet it is assigned
the second issue is due to a combination of several factors first the heredoc needs to be inside a function so this works let a b c trim end xx x xx end but not this fu func let a b c trim end xx x xx end endfu call func second the strings in the heredoc must be unpacked in several variables see h let unpack and there must be space around one of comma separating variables so this works because no unpacking fu func let trim x endfu call func and this works too because no extra space around comma fu b c trim x endfu call but not fu b c endfu call notice space after comma here third one of line needs to start with backslash so works but not

this happens only if term has the value xterm which is why i can t reproduce if i start vim with a different value term st vim nu and only if t rv is set which is why i can t reproduce if i clear the option vim nu cmd set t rv and only the terminal understands the sequence stored in rv which is why can reproduce in st compared internal termcap databases when rv set and when it s not they are identical with exception of those 2 keycodes set sgrmouse m sgrmouserelelase m they don seem to be related to current issue e up key to be sure removed all lines referring to them url l3912 l3918 url l2451 l2452 then recompiled vim so that output of termcap same regardless of whether can still reproduce issue so don think it s due some other terminal option being incorrectly

gvim does support focusgained and focuslost and when you run an ex command from gvim whose output contains multiple lines you can focus a different window without the command line being cleared so making vim in a terminal preserve a multi line output when focusing a different window would make the latter more consistent with gvim the previous minimal vimrc can be reduced to these 2 lines let t ti e 1004h let t te e 1004l but if you want to avoid e349 you need these 2 additional statements exe set s f18 e o exe set s f19 e i if want the code to be useful need these 7 additional lines fu s do event abort if exists event exe do event nomodeline endif endfu nno silent s f18 c u call sid do focuslost cr nno silent f19 c u call sid do focusgained cr and if want events to be restored in all modes not just normal mode need 2 additional mappings for each missing mode

x i know that several related issues were already created but this bug report is even simpler and more straightforward in comparison to others this uses ionic v4 only as front end for a angular web app no android no ios only browser this can be reproduced also by removing any dependencies to native packages ionic native since for web app in browser they are not needed based on the other related issues the resource loading issue can be fixed via changing base href in index html base href but this is not acceptable workaround since on one hand the app proceeds further but on the other hand stops on a new problem with routing ionic ionic cli version c users xxx appdata roaming pm ode modules framework angular version angular devkit build angular version devkit schematics version cli toolkit system nodejs v c program files odejs ode exe npm os windows 10

error timeoutms must be an integer in the range 4000 but got 1 fix mdcsnackbarfoundation validation to handle 1 as well check if further logic works correctly
this is blocking us from presenting reports to our customers there is some pressure on us to deliver this soon our current workaround is to hard code the dates this seems related to another issue with nested queries we re seeing 11028
this is a blocker for us having no data to view in metabase is most problematic i have been able to use metabase with mongodb version but due to some reason the newer version just doesn t work
this type of report is not usable since it gives you inaccurate data i wouldn t count this as critical though i discovered this using a custom query but the same problem applies using sql query
annoying may be related to 10839 or 9286 thank you for all your work on metabase
we use linked tables a lot in our metabase reports and they don t work anymore others may be experiencing this as well
read only profiles can t use drop down filters
it is quite blocking to create custom questions if you look create a custom column for count and then use this custom colum to do the filtering it works perfectly image url in this case using a custom count column works fine as it shows enter a number image url seems like there has been discussion url reagrding this in past and it should be fixed by url but still lingers
this is pretty irritating not being able to compare datasets almost defeats the point of having metabase
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely simply annoying a bit of playing around tends to get round the problem but there doesn t seem much logic behind what solves the issue note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously
lost quite some time and a few inches worth of nails but i guess it s not that severe
risk of missing data points because we know it s an issue we zoom out and check but i don t think we should have to do that love that draw a box to filter is working correctly now but this suffers from the same issue with the top most pins in the filter area being initially hidden from view no strange browser zoom settings or anything like that being used
frustration you can spend a bit of time zooming in on the area of interest then hover a pin for more detail and boom you re back where you started this doesn t seem to be 100 reproducible i ve consistently seen it in all versions of metabase that i ve used but i m trying it now an it s not doing it was just 20 min ago on the same setup
annoying this zoom in is one of our users favorite features they love going from high level down to local detail in this specific example it s not so bad as we can use the simple question instead but that s not always an option
if this can be reproduced this is relevant to everybody using the serialization feature described in the enterprise guide url i e everybody who wants to migrate dashboards connection details etc from one instance to another once

appreciating this is a lab item and not production it may be desirable for the consumer of mui to use a compositional design and have components separated from each other especially as things scale up this allows for more re use and also minimizes the effects of re rendering for example when using mobx observables by minimizing component responsibility tech version material ui v version alpha 23 react v version browser chrome v version

n a n a this is not a critical bug but i spent time figuring out how to resolve it so it may discourage new users btw thanks for this awesome tool i especially enjoy the relation creation tool which is definitely a time saver for models definition
any light on what could be causing these errors would be appreciated thank you
and ideas that may solve the problem i am guessing this url localhost 1337 in the image above is set using the host and port from config environments development server json but changing this is not an option as this is the path through docker container to host machine 1 one idea is to somewhere be able to configure a public url and use this instead if set 2 a second idea to just use url you are currently on there may be use cases i am not aware of but in front end you know all about location window location origin so should be quite easy it may be that first idea already possible thus if it i would like know

i found a few lines in strapi utils lib buildquery js that could be contributing to the problem 1 this line returns undefined for createdat and updatedat attributes i think it should be returning timestamp url l125 2 because type is undefined this function returns the attribute value as a string but it needs to be a date or converted elsewhere to a mongodb isodate for the query to perform as expected url l62 l84 for now i m working around this by if attribute createdat attribute updatedat type timestamp after line 128 and then case timestamp return new date value in the castvaluetotype function but it s pretty hacky solution so i m not going open pr just flagging this for someone who knows their way around amazing strapi better than do

this is a considerable issue in writing re usable js in projects
this could possibly leak authorization information if the user is not careful and does not reauthorize with the newly selected api spec configuration of the url example
the issue 3747 may be related but i think it applies only for path parameters and not for formdata ones thanks
this is a simplified minimal reproduction of the bug the real use case involves mostly similar routes but with different path parameters the idea is to define the endpoint definition once and use a ref to duplicate along with allof to override parameters everything is working except for this weird ui glitch live example code url doc url example swagger openapi definition yaml openapi version info version 1 title description demo of a bug in swagger added by api auto mocking plugin servers description swaggerhub api auto mocking url url definitions parameters sessionid type string in path name sessionid description id of session required true paths api foo post summary foo description does foo stuff tags cat responses 200 successful request api bar post ref paths 1api 1foo post swagger ui configuration options irrelevant defaults

as we are using this in production this means that no one in the company can ask questions from the database or see analytics at all during the times that this is broken as the cluster admin i then need to restart it every time it breaks which is not ideal at especially as we are hoping to use enterprise level service approx 15 users using this
how severe an issue is this bug to you is this annoying blocking some users blocking an upgrade or blocking your usage of metabase entirely note the more honest and specific you are here the more we will take you seriously as i said above we have worked around this issue for the moment but it is annoying for the data people at my company metabase is running in docker k8s it was deployed using helm
blocking i think grouping and filtering is a basic functionality that must work properly
blocks upgrading but we can use version tag without an issue
harmless just reported it out of curiosity
frustration and need to remember what to expect the drill down appears wrong if you don t remember or know
frustrating and stopping me from using the advanced query builder to it s full potential if i can t change previous steps then what s the point
it s a minor annoyance in some places but the overall inconsistency of some dates being displayed as json zulu time others being dates and still more being times is really grating after a while if converted to varchar exported csvs don t have the ability to parse and thus intelligently filter the output
its really annoying and troublesome as i was championing metabase to my c levels over looker qliksense for non technical users as the new notebook features are able to go head to head with the aforementioned bi tools now all the business users on my company are in love with metabase yet they are frustrated all the analysis they ve done cant be saved i had this bug since metabase version and i have updated twice hoping it will clear this bug
getting a lot of user complaint that creating maintaining dashboards is very frustrating

i originally discovered this while trying to put a tabs inside a card body but from looking in the source i found that the underlying problem was caused by the nav code that tabs uses internally in particular it s this part of nav js url l109 l135 javascript let cardheaderbsprefix const cardcontext usecontext cardcontext if navbarcontext else if cardcontext cardheaderbsprefix cardcontext return abstractnav classname classnames classname cardheaderbsprefix variant cardheaderbsprefix perhaps card header should provide its own context type so the nav code could look for that one instead of url operating system n a browser version n a react bootstrap version v version beta 14

when adding a style to all text inputs via textinputstyle the input box on the dialog is clipped adding a textinputlayout to a non dialog layout works fine
i ve a simple input dialog with one edittext kotlin materialdialog this show noautodismiss title res r string title name input positivebutton r string action save name and when i click the outside the dialog the dialog got dismissed
by reading window docs and stackoverflow objective 1 seem to be achievable by acquiring window reference and setting its soft input mode as below kotlin val dialog materialdialog this bottomsheet apply window setsoftinputmode soft input state always hidden however the above line does not work as the soft keyboard still shows upon dialog showing additionally objective 2 seems achievable by the same method call just including another flag is this behavior correct and if so how else can i achieve my objectives
the top of the dialog does not have the correct radii image url
when i long press an empty materialdialog input edittext the paste button is not shown
can t modify a property of an element inside a customview showing a fragment inside a dialog bottomsheet
i m using a custom view with a bottomsheet because i need to hide things later i m saving the bottomsheet in a var to show it however it shows only once if i remove the bottomsheet behavior the now dialog shows always

when showing a date picker dialog in landscape the width is too constrained for the datepicker view inside it causing everything to be squished horizontally see below screenshot url
when the default time is set time picker always showing it as am i e if i set the time 15 45 or 3 45 pm it ll be shown as 3 45 am
md color button text is not respected and instead overridden by colorprimary when set in a theme
if showing a dialog that only contains a message the text does not appear to have the correct top margin it seems too small example img width 401 alt screenshot 2019 03 07 at 11 39 17 src url same example in older library version version x img width 401 alt screenshot 2019 03 07 at 11 38 51 src url
on a dialog with long button text buttons are stacked and the text gravity on the buttons should be end but it s not
is there any way to avoid positive button changing color when color is selected
changing the value of a button text in the ondismiss callback crashes with a npe on the button
when dialog opens there is no default button that has focus you can use the dpad to get focus but if you can easily lose focus by clicking away from a button
a dialog with 3 buttons shows fine on rc5 screenshot 01 url but only shows one button on rc6 and rc7 screenshot 01 url not all devices seem to be affected as eg emulator works fine also on the failing device after rotating to landscape all 3 buttons are displayed

apollo s canbus module updates the can sender when it receives control data in this case it fails to handle the use case when a can tx message has an alive counter and its message trasmit rate is lower than control data update rate this will probably cause a can bus communication issue for certain type of vehicles i am using canbus module to send a can message whose last data byte needs to increment every time when it is sent out successfully in this case the expected output sequence is canid 123 candata 00 00 00 00 f1 canid 123 candata f2 canid 123 candata f3 canid 123 candata f4 however the output is f1 f3 and discontinued alivecounter triggers an error in vehicle then i noticed that sender update called by oncontrolcommand which runs at a faster rate than my target message rate if i comment out sender update in oncontrolcommand function and add update inside for loop within powersendthread issue will be resolved

when setting the camera transformation with respect to the world or static transformation with respect to the car here url l277 it was assigned the wrong transformation matrix because this transformation is used in visualization subnode cc as well

since i upgrade axios from version to version the requests made to fetch a local file file with a relative path return an error request failed with status code 0 however the web browser will always return a status code 0 when the request success because there is no http server involved the xhr readystate is also 4 if there was a network error i believe this one would probably be 0 as well

axios post stopped detecting the default os proxy on windows in version version works ok in previous version version
importing the axios
we use some custom parameters via axios configuration they are used in the response interceptor sometimes there may be a lot of information there so the option to pass it through the headers or params is not suitable for us because of the length limit
a clear and concise description of what the bug is
the bug appeared when i upgraded from version version to version response data now comes back as a string even though responsetype json and content type application json i believe the problem is this changed line in core axios js version config utils merge defaults method get this defaults config config mergeconfig this defaults config i could not find any reference to the defaults import in the new merged and transformresponse function is part of default as a result a json payload is not transformed anymore
i can t set content type to headers when data is formdata
the geturi method only returns the supplied url parameter and not the full request url however using this method in a response interceptor seems to work correctly this might be a duplicate or related to 2190 but i m not sure so just throwing this out there anyway

specific request params do not get merged with the instance default params

i m trying to reliably run multiple cockroachdb processes in automated tests the same task led to 38758 this is harder than i expected in part because cockroach quit doesn t block until the server actually shuts down this leads to a race the server is shutting down but my tests are already trying to start a new server using the same data directory often new process fails start because old process hasn t relinquished its locks error could not cleanup temporary directories from record file could not lock temporary directory users ashah cockroach data cockroach may still be in use io error while lock file users ashah cockroach data temp dir lock resource temporarily unavailable it s easy work around this by sleeping and giving first process a chance shut down cleanly but it takes a very long sleep 10s make tests acceptably reliable it d be much nicer if quit blocked until shutdown completes we could change default behavior or introduce block flag
when running cockroachdb with the background and listening url file flags the listening url file isn t written until after control is returned to the shell this makes it awkward to actually read the url from file which makes background less useful especially in tests where i m starting databases on ephemeral ports it s easy to work around this by retrying until file appears but that s a bit distasteful
when adding rows using default values to tables with int not null and string not null columns default empty array the insert fails the error message is either pq type of array contents int doesn t match column type string or pq type of array contents string doesn t match column type int depending which column is defined first so the second column will produce the error for some reason if there are two array columns of same this issue doesn t seem to occur
there have been multiple instances of users seeing this error we know the cause of this error is due to a single range having so many mvcc versions that it takes up more than 128 mb twice the max range size the cause of why mvcc values on the system config span range are growing so rapidly is not yet fully known but we think it may be due to schema changes usually this error can be resolved by changing a cluster setting set cluster setting kv range backpressure size multiplier 0 as well as adjusting mvcc ttl to a much lower number by default this is 25 hours however as of recent issue has been happening on a particular system config span that houses cluster settings and zone configurations and so any attempt made at changing these results in split failed error as now we have not been able to reproduce but there have been several instances users reporting issue engineering has come up with few ideas on how get root cause issue improve message so that issue can be debugged easier turn off back pressure on that holds cluster settings and zone configurations

this is an extension of what i mentioned in url issuecomment where exporting dashboards and reimporting them was not setting a default index pattern however it looks like the export is not finding the pattern anymore which is likely causing the reimport issues see below when using the rest api url to pull down dashboards to save into a file i m seeing index pattern section as having a 404 not found in previous versions at least in version this was not case id metricbeat type index pattern error statuscode 404 message found t
using default settings server host localhost should make the daemon listen on both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses for localhost it does not the node process only binds to version 5601 and not to 1 5601 this causes errors when localhost resolves to ipv6 as is normally the case when ipv6 is fully implemented

i ran our version integration test against 6 x and the reporting watcher test failed with an error like reporting generation failed reason typeerror cannot read property id of undefined comparing the version pdf report generation url to one from version i see this only in version layout dimensions height width 633 id preserve layout so i think the error about id means that layout is not defined in the url
dev tools key shortcuts that worked in kibana version no longer seem to function in version version i tried several as listed here url and was unable to get any of them to work however when testing on version the key shortcuts worked

in firefox if the vertical height of an option list with a child list is set too small fewer than 9 rows values are cleared from the parent list as soon as they are selected this issue does not occur in chrome version ubuntu version imo the option list takes up way too much vertical space and it s very tempting to try and squash it up as much as possible if the vertical size is set to fewer than 9 grid positions bottom portion of vis renders outside grid position allocated to it although vis appears normal only indication things are wrong is drag handle is further up right side than normal in this configuration when a value selected from option vis will redraw it updates child which resets selection in parent

i m testing calls to a mongodb server which runs in a docker container i m using mongoose to make the calls and use jest as a testrunner in a jest setup file i make sure that i delete all records from the db before each test when run my tests one by one using test only all my tests work however when run my tests in sequence runinband only some of my tests succeeds while others fail this differs from what expect as expect all to pass if they pass using test only is this bug or am doing something wrong
i think this is similar to 5164 in my jest config i have a custom testenvironment that s written in typescript that i want transformed by ts jest

beforeall functions are run even when defined inside of a describe skip block
getting started documentation contains wrong instructions for typescript
if you run a specific test such as using testnamepattern there could be other ways but this is how i found the bug jest will eat any errors thrown outside of that test skipping the test and sometimes complaining about a describe callback not returning a value i did do a very minor dive into this while ago before i determined the cause as when i first started jest was getting these strange describe callback must not return value despite never returning value somewhere internally something returns null instead of undefined which jest doesn t know it s doing and hence complains to the developer
this is not an actual bug it has got to do with how jest decides about the number of workers when maxworkers argument is not passed apparently getmaxworkers url l35 tries to figure out the number of cores and then chooses the number of workers based on that when i run react tests on circleci the container in which test is executed is a shared vm with 36 cores and 64gb of ram as most resources are already used when running tests jest tries to fork 35 child processes and this either leads to tests complaining enomem not enough memory read

i have observed that recently using multiple workers is slower than only one these numbers are from the second test execution of a synthetic that i have uploaded to github url yarn test test suites 26 passed 26 total tests 26 passed 26 total snapshots 0 total time version s yarn test runinband suites passed total tests passed snapshots 0 time version s yarn maxworkers 1 suites tests snapshots 0 time version s my impressions i had the impression that it is the cache system of compiled files that add a significant overhead it looked like there is some contention when multiple workers are trying to compile the same file however i was wrong by tweaking gen sh made each completely independent there are no shared files but execution times are similar this change is not present in repository

there s a strange and subtle change in the way snapshots are handled showing some counter intuitive displays when there is a difference the issue manifests with string values in tomatchsnapshot when a snapshot name is passed as an argument it feels as if strings are sometimes being incorrectly turned into arrays the issue was not observed in jest 23

see reproduction repo url for better understanding when trying to generate a coverage with jest the tests run as they should but no coverage data is collected and there s a cannot read property coveragedata of null error in the console this is likely because jest right now can t work with the unique folder structure that we have on our project see the reproduction repo folder where package json and node modules are right next to folder where all source files are when file to test and test itself is in same folder as node modules coverage data is collected perfectly however when it in next to with node modules it display error mentioned in first paragraph feel free close this if it s not a bug with jest but at this point i cannot think of anything else that could be wrong here other than our legacy structure

we use jest with an un ejected cra version configuration and have noticed extremely slow test speeds when component dependencies are not manually mocked with jest mock using a factory method we added manual mocks with factory methods into a single domain of our code and saw drastic speed improvements attempts to use mock directories made no impact below are the results for only that test domain before unmocked bash test suites 74 passed 74 total tests 183 passed 183 total snapshots 0 total time version s ran all test suites matching notifications i done in version s after mocked with factory methods bash suites 74 passed 74 total tests 183 passed 183 snapshots 0 time version s ran all suites matching notifications i done in s our current hypothesis is this is due to slow module resolution as tests for components deeper dependency trees see a more drastic improvement when mocked a factory method whereas components shallower dependencies see only marginal improvements
until jest 23 shallow rendering any component generated a detailed snapshot see url due to the changes done in 7448 this use case is now broken and returns an empty snapshot without even the props see url

thanks for your hard work releasing jest 24 a clear and concise description of what the bug is on jest version my test collection that totals 49 test suites and 700 tests took on average version seconds to run now in jest version it takes version seconds to run with no changes of any kind to my code tests or environment other than upgrading to jest 24 i m not doing anything fancy this is a serious performance regression i want use 24 take advantage of test todo but i can t afford have my tests take 67 longer run that s a real drop in my productivity any suggestions how diagnose this further or fix this issue i can t post source code because this is proprietary code m working on how can we fix performance regression

hello my set up is babel 7 with typescript and the jest config s transform property is set to babel jest the reason why i m not using ts jest is because i want to transpile the code with babel so i can use the preval plugin url this works great when i when manually runs yarn test it ll transpile code according to babelrc config and run tests without any errors or failures problem arrived when yarn test isn t runed by me directly have a git hook with husky url to have it run yarn test with pre commit hook what happens is whenever a commit happends it ll run yarn test and jest will fail transpile code output logs will be filled encountered an unexpected token and it seems like ignores babel config entirely when command isn t executed directly by me also seems be a connection this errors get vs code extention vscode url being runed in background they do not interfere each other tried without plugin same issue still present

i ve been trying for the last 2 days to figure out why the test is not existing despite following all the steps with no luck until by accident i left the done parameter in afterall without actually explicitly calling it from inside like this afterall done mongoose disconnect this made it exit and work properly but when i explicitly call done from function using promises async await or then or as a callback to mongoose disconnect such as afterall async done await mongoose disconnect it does not exit and keeps hanging when using detectopenhandles it tells me that app listen 3001 is potential open handler which i explicitly closed can t figure if this is a problem in my code or a bug way was able to fix problem above by passing param without using seemed more of a hack or bug than real solution is supposed to do anything if passed only without being called

i ve created a simple hello world fastify example with a errorhandler and it always throws a 404 why
this is not a bug of fastify itself but many fastify plugin packages maintained by this orgnization in most situation plugin packages are installed together with fastify itself and works well when they re installed by npm however when used inside pnpm workspace plugin packages cannot require fastify pacakge to properly fix this bug these plugin packages including but not limited to cors websocket multipart need to add to their peer dependencies

calling fastify ready causes errors to be thrown if you attempt to add routes after it finishes specifically it will throw cannot add route when fastify instance is already started which seems like undesired behavior this seems to be caused by avvio emitting the start event when calling ready since ready comes from avvio when start is emitted fastify appears to no longer allow route registration which seems not be the correct behavior from looking at the documentation on ready it appears this should not be a side effect and only the plugins should loaded

hello everyone thanks for reading this issue i have the following schema js schema querystring type object properties hello type array so when sending just one element url hello 1 they not parse to 1 throw a error of validation querystring hello should be array if it s really a bug i can try to fix it thanks
when defining a route it s easier to schema query be automatically copied into schema querystring mainly because request query is what we use to access the querystring and simmetry here would be good moreover we should look into doing some stricter validation of those properties to catch this type of errors

a clear and concise description of what the bug is
throw ing an error from non async route handler crashes the whole app
when using an async prevalidation hook the handler will be called multiple times
the remoteaddress is undefined if you try to access it with request ip in a request handler
using some named schema as items in other schema cause exception when using first schema
i don t seem to have an issue with other async handlers just prehandler it seems to function fine if i call reply send abc or throw new error abc but if i simply return abc do not return at all or return undefined the request just hangs the request never makes it beyond prehandler from what i can tell
if addschema is called within decorated function using fastify decorate it throws an error that such schema already exists however it is called only once

a clear and concise description of what the bug is
what happened what are you seeing how did you arrive here square instead of icon
otf font is replace words in my buttons notifications notifi cat icon ions add ad icon d device paring device pa ring icon ttf works as expected however the g and y get cut off this is what the ttf files do url however it is not resolved their fix does not work
the example below is a fa question circle icon the structure of the font awesome generated elements will be as follows svg title title path path svg however when running this in internet explorer it does not show a tool tip when hovering over the icon but when using structure given here title being first child of path element svg path title svg it works in internet explorer i found support for this markup here url url so it should be a preferable way to go given all browsers are ok with it
the typescript definition of the layer function misses the params argument causing the compiler to raise an error url l13 l17
the npm package fortawesome fontawesome common types url in its latest version version has a package json that declares license mit but the license txt file in the package contains the font awesome pro license at least one of this must be wrong i am not sure why this happens because url was last changed 10 months ago and contains fontawesome free license which is still not ideal but at least refers to mit for code although npm package was published just one month ago
when using class fa swap opacity on icon envelope open text the lettering disappears creating a blank letter
brands showing as a squares all other types of icons works as expected
what happened what are you seeing how did you arrive here first of all i am not sure it is a bug i get error in page speed insight leverage the font display css feature to ensure text is user visible while webfonts are loading with a list of awesome font i am using since i do not have access to your css may ask you to change in css font display auto to font display swap it should help or you may know other solutions resolve that issue the website is www phodestravel com
when using ul class fa ul li span class fa li i class fad fa angle double right i span li ul the browser throws an error box in the place where the icon should be bug only appears to be with the new duotone icons
what happened what are you seeing how did you arrive here i included the i class fab fa facebook i icon on my webpage but the class displays as the square version of the facebook icon and not round version as expected
in firefox at least as of version possibly earlier inspecting an i fa element won t show any styles neither on the i neither on the pseudo before image url notice how the styles area is empty this occurs when font awesome pro is loaded with subresource integrity check i e integrity sha384 and another resource e g a javascript file is also loaded with integrity check i reported the bug here on bugzilla url but haven t seen it documented anywhere so think it makes sense to have information here too
in my project i am using fontawesome with the npm function but when i import the css files into my own css file i can only use the brand icons when i import fontawesome with a cdn it works fine but don t want to use it that way so can reduce html requests

when using rate limiting redis without defining an override the key used to look up the current amount in redis does not respect any dimensions unless there is an override provided see url l292 here the key is defined as the name of quota used if there is an override name will be extended by a hash of matching dimension if no override is provided key will be unchanged see url l300 furthermore key only identifier passed to lua script see url l330 this problematic as instances referring to same quota will effectively use same counter unless you have an provided i e different services might accidentally share same counter also this does not allow per pod rate limiting while you can provide a dimension containing destination name you cannot provide as you cannot know all pod names and thus all pods will use same

the istio regression patrol is showing a regression in throughput and response time on all 3 configurations full istio no mixer ingress only and for the 2 branches tested version and version for builds starting on 07 25 the degradation is from 10 to 15 compared with the baseline version ga or previous builds see url to verify that this degradation was not due to some unforeseen change in test environment i ran again load with build 07 22 and got good results as shown in comparison charts below for 2 configurations image url image url since ingress only configuration is equally affected that indicates a change introduced in ingress gateway could be cause of this regression

preface this is without galley mcp pilot is directly interacting with k8s not sure if moving to galley would change the behavior the podcache url l30 and workloadsbyid url l120 caches are keyed on pod ip we are running into issues with this for pods that have hostnetwork true because we end up with multiple pods with the same ip this causes the workloadupdate url l415 method to constantly trigger full pushes due to label mismatches url l457 since it is actually comparing different pods in a large cluster several host networked daemonset pods this ends up creating a huge amount of load on pilot

brief overview in our current implementation of istio the ingress gateway sits behind one of our partner s reverse proxies i e the client owns the domain name which gets resolved to their reverse proxy which in turn forwards traffic to our ingress gateway ip in turn the ingress gateway acts as reverse proxy itself routing traffic to either an azure web app web frontend or an api service running on kubernetes while this system works fine we ve found that since migrating to this new implementation before requests would go directly from partner s reverse proxy azure or kubernetes we lost track of client source ip in http headers these were recorded
consul cpu usage reached to 300 while service changes in my test environment the high cpu usage of consul is caused by the pilot consul registry which is called multiple times while services change in order to push the changed services to envoy sidecars the repeated consul registry calls result in hundreds of remote calls to catalog rest apis 49614 root 20 0 26472 s version version 35768 39 49614 root 20 0 26472 s version version 35768 40 49614 root 20 0 26472 s 35768 40 49614 root 20 0 26472 s 35768 47 54 35769 03 35769 12 35769 15 35769 18 18 19

when a meshconfig file is not found or could not be loaded pilot resorts to reading from the istio configmap directly in case we re on kubernetes it doesn t do this for the meshnetworks here it only tries to load from a file and uses a default configuration if that s not possible my understanding is that pilot should not be directly dependent on kubernetes in the future so i think it should only try to read the meshconfig from a file which on kubernetes will be mounted configmap anyway i understand there are still lot of places where pilot uses k8s directly but this seems like an instance where it could be easily removed am i missing something here is this code path used for testing purposes codecov looks like s

the helm chart for galley fails to deploy the object when galley is deployed to a namespace other than istio system this problem was fixed in pr 7477 url in july 2018 but the commit has never been merged into a release since then it is a simple one line fix the update is not in master and is currently not in version although galley doesn t crash feature essentially disabled

with global sds enabled false and a sdsudspath set as non empty such as global sds sdsudspath some path causes gateway configuration to have a non empty sdsudspath which in turn causes issues in the deployment as there are a number of conditional checks in pilot which use the sdsudspath to check if sds functionality should be used or not
specifying address version in a gateway section works for us that endpoint shows up appropriately when going cross cluster specifying address some fqdn com does not the gateway endpoints silently vanish

i thought building a new envoy binary from istio proxy branch release version and putting it into a new image would give me the same setup as if using the official proxyv2 but it didn t there s significant regression in terms of cpu usage and latency
adding a slash after the hub url when defining image values breaks compatibility with certain docker registries ex katello satellite
i updated to version by the istio demo yaml but when i applied this yaml to k8s the pilot the ingressgateway and the egressgateway were all restarted constantly because oomkilled then i found that they are all set to a smaller limit which not set before version so i had to delete limit and now everything is fine so want know why set such a small limit don t think this limit is necessary
i am trying to use my own set of certificates for mtls citadel does not push my external certificates to the envoy proxies

the documentation in multiple places says there is a 15s timeout with requests by default i can confirm that this is not functioning if it is intended in fact i have requests that go over 60s just fine there may not even be a real timeout in place applying a virutalservice with a timeout works as expected

basically in v1 i can call resetform values in an onsubmit to reset the dirty state and touched etc this is sort of equivalent to enablereinitialize which i think does work correctly in v2 calling resetform values doesn t seem to change the values in proceeding renders worth noting that my submit handler is async so there may be renders between the issubmitting and resetform

i m testing version rc 8 and found a bug when placing two formik in same render validation before onsubmit fail because its evaluates another formik s fields validate props
in our product we use validationschema to validate our form but we also allow customers to add their own form fields to it since we have no idea what their validation will be it can t be included in our yup validation so they need to validate at the field level when the form is submitted formik shows the field as invalid but not as touched like it does with validationschema
we have a field text that may be empty when it is empty it is not in the values state of formik and therefore also not in the values argument to the handlesubmit function
it looks like at one point the formikerrors type allowed errors to be type any which was added in bug 266 to support i18n frameworks but over the course of a couple of typescript upgrades this got dropped and the type was changed to string i d like to change it back any once again make it easier use with i18n frameworks or just put other react elements in error messages
the docs states url field render props field s render props are an object containing field an object containing onchange onblur name and value of the field form the formik bag any other props passed to
edit after more investigation i ve noticed it happens when we use the array helper insert it has a different behavior from version and above hey i m submitting this bug because i ve noticed something has changed in the touched shape between formik version and version
when a fields value is an object instead of an array string a change to the value will not dirty the form this causes the form to require another item to be changed for the form to dirty and in case where isinitialvalid is false for form even be valid
calling arrayhelpers push new someobject doesn t work
i m using two identical form areas area 1 and area 2 that differ only in the field names i use a shared form component that assigns the different field names based on a prefix i pass to the common component whenever i select something in area 1 the parallel field in area 2 also gets its value set value is actually present in formik value tree a simplified version looks like this const commonform prefix relayprops view fastfield component textfield required name prefix name label name view commonform prefix field1 commonform field2

if a user has written a custom query in some cases it is showing an incorrect association to a table not used in the custom query for example custom question shows example database example schema example table but table is not being used anywhere in the custom query what makes the issue a little more odd is that i don t see this necessarily happening with all queries so i m not sure why it s doing for this particular query which was written by another user

since updating to v version we re getting sorry you don t have permission to see that errors when trying to save anything questions dashboards etc and often even when running queries the errors occur regardless of whether the user is an admin or not there s no single obvious this is what makes a query error out but simpler queries are more likely to work than complex ones queries with more joins more aggregates and or more window functions are likely error out in all cases the queries work correctly when run directly against the database we have two databases configured one postgresql and one snowflake and same errors occur in both cases

when summarizing a group of orders and grouping on a column from another joined table the drill down to view these orders breaks as it only looks for it in the main table image url
when aggregating by month the truncated dates are returned in the incorrect format preventing metabase for charting anything this issue appears to be related to the str to date mysql function which metabase uses in its truncation of dates for example i want the count of rows by month from a table using custom question ui to construct a count of rows with by month result i get back is a blank chart with an error image url error reads data includes missing dimension values we encountered an invalid date aunched at is an unaggregated field if it has more than one value at a point on x axis values will be summed note that in this case launched at is datetime type column

i have a question that shows a table that counts rows by day and time for example how many sessions took place on monday at 4pm for example i have read the time faq guide and don t think the issue is related to this the reason i think this is because i can confirm that the database record timestamp matches metabase value

a clear and concise description of what the bug is upgrading from v version to v version we are now unable to perform any kind of queries against our bigquery data sets these can be native queries that work in bigquery console and are pasted into metabase that throw errors or they can be more complex reports that rely on bigquery built with the custom query builder this can be a simple query

when switched back to the normal screen for a short time sometimes a digit 1 appears in the bottom left corner even more interestingly the number of such 1 s in that row keeps growing despite the cursor being explicitly moved to row 28 column 1 every time and changing that to column 2 keeps it a digit 1 that appears so it s not where it comes from when switched back to alternate screen sometimes a letter h appears at top left both artifacts occur me with probability of perhaps 25 xa8c50 ish play with timing constant if they don t want appear you it might make difference i m not sure

the following weirdnesses occur a literal gets printed it shouldn t that gets printed 6 seconds after starting the command line rather than 1 second after that is not immediately when received but when the next character whether that s a newline or not is received subsequent newlines don t move the cursor to beginning of line as expected but walk downwards in second column so it seems parser might be stuck in some weird mode bug does not occur if delay is eliminated and unsupported escape sequence is printed in a single step it completely ignored then as expected bug does not occur with supported escape sequences either such as setting title with osc 0 it s immune to injected delays as expected
it displays weird characters
the should still be underlined bits aren t underlined note that sgr codes 22 27 39 and 49 seem to cause this effect but only if they re predeced by a 1 7 30 37 or 40 47 resp that is only if they do actually turn off some other attribute also note that if the should still be underlined text is made longer so that it overflows to the next line or even multiple new lines it s underlined in the last one of these lines this makes it perhaps a reincarnation of 47 furthermore changing window width and thus causing a reflow of text removes underlining from last line

hello is printed in brightwhite and is hard to see in some color schemes brightwhite is identical to the background color and is completely invisible it looks like the interpretation of the ansi bold sequence simply to render the following text in brightwhite this works if background dark and foreground light but it pretty useless when using a light background and dark text this impacts all programs that use ansi escape sequences e g less pager

in the windows console the movement isn t constrained by the margins as a result the cuu sequences ends up at top of viewport and cud sequences ends up at bottom image url note that this isn t a regression of 170 we do get it right if initial cursor position was inside margins it s just when it starts off outside margins that it s not being constrained complication is that you sometimes don t want cursor position constrained for example if you re moving up with cuu and you started off above top margin then there s no need to constrain position below that margin
the margins are ignored by the windows console so cnl moves all the way to the bottom of viewport and cpl moves all way to top of viewport image url i can t say for certain that this is wrong but i think we should probably be trying to match xterm and vte behavior unless there is convincing evidence that they ve got it wrong

my suspicion is that the windows terminal is counting the ansi characters when drawing the text but at the same time correctly interpreting escape sequences and changing text
the row you are on is not highlighted you must click on the first character of the row not to the left of it this requires for more precise highlighting to avoid missing what you want to copy and is far slower

the vertical extent of the affected area seems to be determined by the decstbm margins rather than the cliprect and viewport content is actually moved up by 1 line instead of down by 4 image url i could possibly imagine it was intentional for decstbm margins to have an affect if it wasn t for fact that scroll direction was backwards so i m almost certain that this is not intended behavior as i mentioned in issue 2543 i think this is another argument in favor of removing decstbm margin checking from scrollregion function
in the windows console the line feeds cause the viewport to scroll up just as they would if there were no margins set so the bottom line actually ends up 3 lines from bottom and top line has scrolled out of view image url

both commands are ignored because they re executed above the top of the scroll margins now i can t say for sure that this is the wrong behavior the vt510 documentation says that both ich url and dch url have no effect outside scrolling margins but it s possible they were referring only to horizontal margins in that particular context if you look at dec std 070 manual wording is a lot clearer if active position is outside left or right margins this control is ignored however just to confuse things some more dec std 070 manual also provides a kind of pseudo code algorithm for each command and algorithm for ich seems to suggest that it limited by both horizontal and vertical while dch only affected by horizontal i suspect might just be a bug in ich algorithm but who knows bottom line documentation isn t particularly clear about this but i do know we don t currently match xterm s behavior

ctrl c cancels potentially terminating foreground jobs this makes sense from a terminal point of view but windows users are used to hitting ctrl c to copy text that there is some text selected is a good indication that the user wishes to copy not to cancel
arguably data corruption the values still work technically but they are not what the user specified a failure to properly re encode will lose data better to leave the original values untouched related if i omit a profile guid why add one to the file pick one on load and use it internally but unless it s getting referenced elsewhere in file why have it at all

no background image shown bad characters great sadness given the rash of other character issues i think it s a failure to interpret utf 8 perhaps further investigation showed that switching the encoding of the file in vs would fix the tab issue but terminal would rewrite background image paths with uxxxx codes which i d have to re type
typing performance will be horrible until the image has been scrolled off the screen bad enough that typing will have 1 second of lag

no scrolling of the part after the cursor happens instead the line following the line cursor was in is replaced with part of line cursor resides in and cursor correctly moves down to beginning of next line i e you see line1 li ne2 and position is correctly before n character of ne2 note that this behavior is different from 2186 hence separate bug because part following overwrites subsequent whereas in 2186 it does not note that after saving file expected behavior is what correctly happens to file data only display behavior incorrect
no scrolling of the part after the cursor happens instead the line the cursor was in is cleared becomes empty not disappear and cursor correctly moves down to beginning of next line i e you see line1 line3 and cursor position is at beginning of line3 note that after saving file expected behavior is what correctly happens to file data only display behavior is incorrect
the app essentially stops responding it will return to normal eventually but how long that takes depends on the speed of your computer and how full the scrollback was to start with this might be a duplicate of one of the other freeze on exit bugs e g 1445 since terminal seems to generate an erase scrollback call whenever you exit but it only happens when actually typing exit in shell closing tab directly works ok from what i ve been able to determine source of problem is in terminal eraseindisplay method when erasetype is erasetype scrollback it performs a loop clear every line scrollback url l340 l345 note that eraseiter outputcelliterator is set size full area being cleared but a buffer write call is made with that iterator for every line each one those calls enough clear entire area so it s essentially performing a huge write operation over and over again if your buffer large this can take forever i think this probably regression i have preview build version installed on this machine too and that doesn t seem have problem
the blank lines are black rather than red however if you scroll down to the very end of the buffer you ll see the 4 red lines there instead i believe problem is that call to scrollregion should have been passed a clip rect matching window viewport but instead was given a rect encompassing full buffer size in this case offending code is in function which calls scrollregion function via method url l2055 l2063 screenedges rect with which srclip rect is initialised is set here url l2036

the font fallback doesn t work and you just see a question mark error glyph i believe this is a regression caused by the windows version version check introduced in pr 1274 i m guessing it might be because verifyversioninfo returns false when called by applications that do not have a compatibility manifest according to the docs here url remarks whatever the reason removing version check url l139 fixes problem for me not that i m suggesting that s solution just confirming what i believe is source of problem

right now in its current state the terminal uses very high resources while doing cmatrix which is about 30 cpu usage or more depending on the size of the terminal which is higher than the number i saw with older versions of terminal about 20 ish it visibly lags while doing normal tasks like installing a package or any task where lots of lines update quickly which kind of frustrating a little bit but still in case crashing entire terminal after trying to close tab i never did any serious task while executing cmatrix but that could end up very bad as entire crashes here is one multiple times it crashed image url

the output ends at the null character and the after part of the string is not displayed image url sometimes i don t even see following command prompt i assume it depends on how much content is buffered before it s output i can t reproduce this in released version of windows terminal though it only happens for me with a locally built version but looking at code in debugger i can see why it is failing so m really confused why would ever work if you look at termcontrol initializeterminal method there s a lambda expression which takes terminal output in form of an hstring and passes on to terminal write method which expects a wstring view url l418 l420 but because s using c str method on hstring s losing length of data so wstring view is forced to guess length from null terminator thus losing half characters if that hstring had been passed directly to write method would actually have worked because hstring has a cast operator which automatically converts to wstring view and retains real length btw have actually built version code with c str call removed and confirmed that does fix problem for me

diff method gives 1 day difference in time
in locale tr do format is not working need to test all formats again
a clear and concise description of what the bug is
when using moment time add 7 days format it gives invalid date which is 8 days
two different dates when parsed to timestamp x are returning the same exact number
as said in the title it seems that moment js is translating moment objects into javascript date objects with wrong values and this is causing issues when doing operations with moments cause it seems correct me if i m wrong that moment js actually converts its moment objects into a date object to do things like comparisons
the diff for days method while expected return value for 1 on all time zones but it gets 0 only for the mentioned dates below in the specific time zone tehran differences days between 23 march and 22 march
duration is computed incorrectly from iso 8601 format for some edge cases for example moment computes p64d to be 2 months 3 days
parsing a date in the following format 10 50 01 02 2019 as dd mm yyyy and then re formatting it into string with the original format hh mm dd mm yyyy does not yield the same date 00 00 10 02 2019
build failures due to incorrect type returned seems some method return a type depending on arguments type ie moment duration has a behavior that change depending on arguments given moment duration number return a duration object moment duration number string return a string moment number unitoftime durationconstructor return object
if i try to compile my typescript app with webpack i get an error for each locale that moment can t be resolved this error is repeated for every other locale error in node modules moment locale km js module not found error can t resolve moment in c progs dev var private moment test ode modules locale node modules km js 5 50 70 node modules sync node js src app ts
adding 1 day to march24th in the atlantic azores timezone yields the same day
for some reason date parsing yields invalid dates while the format seems to be correct i suspect this is due to the fact that the date is in the last week of year but that s only a hunch
we have come across an issue that seems to me would be best fixed inside the moment timezone or the moment library rather than end users having to implement their own logic to handle it is related to this issue url
same as a bug that was closed due to lack of info 30 of march 2014 returns a very weird result 1568
converting from a javascript date object to a moment object extracting a yyyy ww format converting the extracted value to a moment and from that moment to js date object results in invalid date
using moment week returns week 1 but moment year still returns 2018 creating a lot of issues in our code
when generating a date with moment based off of year and week number the dates for all weeks in 2018 are generated in 2019 instead
according to the documentation i can pass an object with custom formats to moment locale but doing so gives output in default locale us
utcoffset is giving wrong date
when you try to set multiple relativetimethresholds fromnow doesn t work as intended for the s and ss values
moment 2018 12 31 format yyyy ww will return 2018 01 when it should give 2019 01

i m not sure if this is a bug or a feature when looking at the code blocks in the graph view the last field will auto size to just the length of longest entry so that it does not have extra space even if field is set to be larger this makes sense bug feature is that this calculation does not occur for any field except last one that means if last field width is set to 50 but largest entry only 25 will resize to 25 so that it doesn t waste unneeded space if same situation occurs in 2nd last and there an entry in 2nd tot will not resize so in case 2nd width will be 50 even though longest entry only 25 i m unsure this a bug or as intended it seems make most sense have fields auto resize longest input up maximum value specified since occurs but any others it seems more like a bug than feature

when using the default createlabel method exposed to the python api it will not correctly set the new label as the primary label even if true is passed for makeprimary on a function it does seem to work at any other point in listing
maybe i m doing fused register parameters wrong but when a named function parameter is split between more than one register e g ax bx for a 16 bit value the disassembly treats both registers as that name rather than a subpart of that name
the original identification was that bne decodes as lsl in arm mode but upon closer inspection it appears the decoder is changing into thumb mode without apparent cause lab xref 1 j 00 00 54 e3 cmp r4 0x0 00 00 53 13 cmpne param 4 0x0 009bb91c 01 lsl param 2 param 1 0x0 009bb91e 1a sub param 1 1 when it should decode to the following from vivisect text cmp r4 0x00 text cmpne r3 0x00 text bne loc clearly the first two instructions are being decoded correctly but then ghidra is decoding next instruction as thumb lsl btw if imm5 0 it s supposed to be a mov instruction
find text highlight in decompiler is not cleared after clicking a different line or closing the decompiler find text dialog
the decompiler crashes and pops out several windows with the same info
on arm cortex little endian using the patch feature on a cmp w instruction creates an incorrect instruction
ghidra tries to automatically open pdb files from the location stored in a pe file which could pose a risk on windows since using a file path that points to a windows share could leak ntlmv2 hashes and also provides possibility for an smb relay attack
the function signature editor doesn t have the ability to understand flexible arrays this seems to be due to the way it s parsing the text field however it s also not possible to set up a flexible array in custom storage options
when marking a function as returning a char and accepting 2 char parameters strcpy the stack analysis seems to get confused and decompiler output becomes wildly incorrect
when part of the binary is exported to intel hex format using the export program function with the selection only checkbox ticked the saved binary does not include all selected data specifically last instruction does not seem to be saved note exporting to binary seems however to work ok this only applies intel hex format update selecting less than 16 bytes e g just 2 bytes also causes problems whether either nothing gets exported or entire binary gets exported
the font setting resets only for certain fonts when codebrowser is restarted
when editing a function uint32 t when formed by ax bx or cx dx keeps changing to 2 bytes
a clear and concise description of what the bug is
in many cases instructions that reference data segment addresses do not result in assigning symbols in the data segment
in quite some cases the decompiler does not identify parameters to vararg functions such as printf sprintf correct y
option automatically save tools in main window of ghidra edit tool options tool is set between restarts
ghidra correctly recognizes the image load config directory64 structure then it seems to categorize the guardcffunctiontable as containing an array of imagebaseoffset32 ibo32 entries
6502 has an instruction lda addr x and lda addr y which loads the assembler with the contents of address addr x or addr y when this is disassembled sometimes the results has a label sometimes it doesn t an example is shown below from the same binary 078f bd 00 0c lda 0xc00 x 0792 c9 20 cmp 0x20 0794 d0 f8 bne lab 078e 0796 86 02 stx portc lab 0798 xref 1 077e j 0798 a2 00 ldx 0x0 lab 079a xref 1 07a3 j 079a bd 00 0c lda dat 0c00 x 079d 20 ee ff jsr oswrch void oswrch byte character as can be seen entry at 0x78f uses 0xc00 whereas entry at 0x79a uses label dat 0c00 looking at instruction info dialogue it appears that on one with a label it decides that 0xc00 is an address but doesn t on one without a label in all cases with 6502 0xbd means that passed 16 bit parameter is an address
there does not appear to be any horizontal scrolling available in the built in script editor when multiple files are open in the editor the only workaround is to resize the window pane
when i opened a relatively large xml file generated by ida ghidra could not effectively recognize that it was an xml file so i could not properly import a file i switched to a smaller program and tried to open a smaller xml file corresponding to ida and ghidra was able to recognize that it was an xml therefore i think there is bug in the place where ghidra imported the please fix it thank you
after applying this patch url issuecomment to be able to load chrome exe pdb latest version can be retrieved using symchk from url the generated xml file is chrome exe pdb xml zip url the following error appears bug screenshot url
after downloading ghidra and jdk ghidra shows a cliiped glitched version of the full gui i had to click around randomly to even get passed the welcome screen
the key binding for the data recently used action recentlyusedaction java from context menu data last used is reset between restarts
ghidra seems to not like the executables that are written in visual c compiled with visual studio 2017 enterprise in particular it does not recognize the library functions e g printf in contrast to that it works for the basically same code compiled with gcc version version ubuntu version 6ubuntu1 version also it seems to not recognize objects of type const char or in other words a array of strings additionally it seems like its discriminating for loops
the version tracker tool displays the number of matches in subwindow titles at least these numbers turn negative even in case of binaries with moderate sizes i assume this is due to java treating all integers as signed by default in particular ghidra util table addressbasedtablemodel getrowcount seems to return int signed datatype which is then used in createtablemodel for example a trivial solution would be to change the return value of getrowcount to long
in the decompile window there is a context menu option for auto create structure when right clicking on numeric values added to variables such as the 0x38 part of pcvar3 char
window corruption in codebrowser and program manager see the screenshots
ghidra is not finding symbols in my symbol server that has 2 tier hierarchy enabled see more about this here url basically instead of just having a root that contains pdb directories there is an intermediate level with the first two letters of the binary so kernel32 pdb will be under c symbols ke kernel32 pdb for example
when i try to import certain binaries ghidra warns that it can t find some referenced library files except when i look at the locations where it says they weren t found they re there
when executing ghidra from a given path the java process working directory is set to this path then when launching python interpreter located in ghidra codebrowser window python ghidra will try to execute an arbitrary file cmd exe located at the attacker choosen working directory

the header has architecture spelled incorrectly and references document md00097 while the actual document id is md00087 i was unable to find any md00097 while md00087 is indeed mips architecture for programmers volume ii a the mips64 instruction set reference manual
when all function decompilation analysis options are disabled ghidra applies decompilation analysis anyway
there is a link on the contributor s guide contributing md for the text developer s guide that leads to a githhub 404 error page
ghidra attempts to open a file in its installation folder in write instead of opening it in read only
project open restore is susceptible to xml external entity expansion attacks this can be exploited in various ways by getting someone to open restore a project prepared by attacker
compiling a specific c code with the default gcc clang on macos version makes the analysis fail
although ghidra was able to find a class name and it appears in the disassembler the class name does not show on the decompiled view
i am running it on a 43 4k monitor with scaling set to 150 and every window that opens in codebrowser is partially off the screen to move it back on screen i use alt space select move and use keyboard to move it back down
if you import an elf binary with the format as executable and linking format elf and then export that binary it creates a corrupted binary that segfaults however if you import it as raw binary and manually select the language then the exported file works as expected

after merging 7553 feat implement css variables and css calc there is a limitation in the implementation of css calc in nativescript expressions like calc 100 10px are reduced to calc 100 10px because we don t know what the relative size of 100 is at the time

using the clip path css property when an image is dynamically loaded is not working for example like this image src myasset image
given we have a css selector like this css w 1 2 width 50 this is fully supported in browsers however in nativescript when the css parser parses it the selector is parsed as w 1 completely ignoring the 2 part in practice you would use these selectors as element class w 1 2 the issue with them parsing as just w 1 is that if you already have a class it will override it s properties and lead to undesired results
the runtime error i am seeing is as follows 1 on the android version of the application i start on a page and do an unanimated transition to a second page 2 from the second page i do an animated transition to a third page 3 from third i call frame goback to go back to first 4 once on first again you cannot navigate anywhere and navigatedto event for first and navigatedfrom event from third are not called very specific know have a specific reason for using an unanimated transition from one next in my app as well

this is a really strange issue when the bottomnav is loaded all looks correctly but when you change the tab selection the font of the text in tabs changes to some strange color that seems to have some alpha applied
this is a rather strange bug if you have a textfield on the 2 tab and you have the textfield edtable property bound to some value and the autocapitalizationtype is set to sentences the default one text field never gets enabled
if you dynamically generate tabs when the bottomnavigation control has a class applied to it the applications crashes
dynamically generating tabs that have an icon source set to a font crashes the app under android under ios make the tabs not visible similar to 7609

when a listpicker component is rendered with selectedindex property bound it immediately emits an selectedindexchange even thought selectedindex has not changed
on android the listpicker continuously emits selectedindexchange events as the user interacts with the list wheel this results in ui jank when selectedindexchange handler performs a heavy operation the same problem does not happen on ios because ios only emits a selectedindexchange event once user releases list wheel and takes finger off screen

the md5sums declared in the docs for the kickstart sh and kickstart static64 sh seem to be out of sync again the docs already contain new hashes for both files while curl ss url md5sum cut d f 1 still returns old checksum and therefore fails my deployment i m aware that in 6049 a similar issue was reported and then resolved but it seems error has cropped up again and last change to kickstart scripts was yesterday 2019 09 17 at time of reporting this issue so maybe there is another problem in deployment pipeline or maybe i m just not patient enough just as an additional question how often are these deployments kickstart scripts expected to change i wanted to download verify run them via anisble if checksum changes regularly i would probably need skip validation
when running netdata in a docker container per the docs url the network interfaces of docker containers are each shown as veth and in the network interfaces section they should be shown with the container s name and in appropriate section for that docker container as they are when netdata does not run in a container note that this is even when netdata has access to var run docker sock both through a socket proxy or a volume with group access this bug is related to 5383 this bug was fixed for netdata instances running not but still remains for those

in section applications cpu i have noticed that ssh group is reported as consuming almost 100 cpu constantly and after manual checking it seems that this is wrong i have one process consuming 100 cpu but it is definitely not ssh after starting another process for testing purpose from different session usage was doubled process tree looks like this image url isaac64 was the first one reported in ssh group openssl was the second started for testing checking proc entries didn t reveal anything in exe path cmdline or comm that could match ssh my app groups config has the line unchanged from default scp dropbear if i remove usage is reported as usual other adding sshd causes netdata to account cpu usage for all apps started from sessions for itself i e it looks like it propagated somehow to sshd and this makes me wonder why there are more processes below and above sshd

when someone s netdata is connected to a private registry they will want to know that by signing in to netdata cloud they will use the netdata cloud registry instead of their private registry if they click the sign in button on the top right corner they see this popup image url however if click on either of the nodes sup beta sup buttons on either top navigation or dropdown on left hand side will not get this popup and will go directly to netdata cloud sign in we should minimize incidents where people don t know are no longer using their private registry consistency in popup behavior also make documentation simpler also y first issue so i welcome feedback how make these better

as discussed we need to investigate the root cause of netdata crash on one of our demo servers due to maximum open files limit netdata should not crash when max file descriptors are reached netdata should allocate a fd budget for dbengine and inform the user of the typical requirements the user should be able to configure service fd budget depending on her needs such as amount of streaming slaves connected to this master netdata should not allow a new streaming slave connect this master if fd budget has run out in unlikely event descriptors running out dbengine will continue writing on same data and journal files until problem is resolved error condition will be recorded with specific statistics and a new alarm will be generated cc cakrit ktsaou

following up the discussion on 5586 we realised that we need to make an adjustment so that default plugins permission gets reduced to 0750 after the change the permissions will look like this root plugins d ls ltr plugin rwxr x 1 root netdata 19123 apr 12 15 11 charts d plugin rwxr x 1 root netdata 5516 apr 12 15 11 fping plugin rwxr x 1 root netdata 11060 apr 12 15 11 node d plugin rwxr x 1 netdata 21336 apr 12 15 11 python d rwsr 89976 apps go plugins reasoning on this change we don t want broad permissions to the plugins in general only people with authoritative access should have permission to run this for any reason we always run with a user that has either user or group permissions so no need for other permissions when run as establish or when not possible and when run as simple user have user group s group information so should not be affected by this change also users won t be affected when i am i am authorized execute and i have installed as simple i again have

currently the bash curl ss url installation does not work on the fedora 30 pre release the specific problems are fedora 30 starts to cut down on python2 packages while still providing a base python2 binary the install required packages sh script sees python2 binary and therefore assumes a python2 installation is fine and then fails to install necessary packages that don t exist anymore install required packages sh assumes that libuuid devel is installed by default on fedora however on fedora 30 this is not case anymore install required sh misses to this dependency and compilation fails in configure stage as a result i attach a modified version of required sh script albeit renamed txt due to github file upload naming issues that adds some exceptions make it work 30 it may not be final solution for script but it could give you some pointers what s necessary link attached file is here txt url side note i didn t find script in netdata repository it seems be maintained outside maybe you want consider include this in repository which would facilitate improvement suggestions such as this one as they could be submitted as pull requests

slack ignores channel and username parameters the api has been changed so that now it is required to specify the channel the messages will be posted to during the creation of a webhook majority of your legacy code for sending messages using incoming webhooks should continue to work within a slack app without much modification only thing you can no longer do is customize destination channel and author identity at runtime source url i guess that it also makes 3722 obsolete

the issues occur when you run multiple builds concurrently or even sequentially in the same process for the first issue it seems that module resolution is only run once for both builds which creates a problem if for example you re building a browser and server bundle the second issue is that parcel keeps process open even after completing its work when building w two bundlers

the registry parameter for container templates seems to have some issues both with usage on container deployment and setting of the parameter via the new portainer template ui the docs don t have a sample for registry but from code it appears that registry should be set using hostname of alternate registry like docker ourdomain com rather than vanity name of setup in portainer when doing this via template json for initial load like image docker ourimage latest docker ourdomain com with a configured in portainer with auth for docker ourdomain com then trying to deploy a container based on that template portainer replies failure no such image ourdomain com ourimage latest however that image can be pulled

the gumbel softmax function returns seemingly random output when inputs are distributed around 0 to 1 i think this problem arises from the gaussian noise added to the softmax if inputs are of similar order of magnitude the noise overtakes output even using gumbel softmax on one hot vectors will generate a random one hot output this probably isn t a problem if softmax is used within a training procedure but i have a pipeline where inputs to are near one hot encodings in lieu of having hacky solution on my end i e multiplying my input data by 100 or adjusting eps value to large positive maybe there could be an option specify noise level or whether use purist version of gumbel without noise

ios wkwebview seems to have a bug with reporting wrong window innerheight and window innerwidth in the resize event when the device is rotated the values are stale it eventually ends up reporting a square screen with the smaller of 2 values this in turn causes screen plugin to report incorrect dimensions which then cascades to every other area that depends on it like qpage setting minimum height inside a qlayout wkwebview does end up with correct values at some point just not in time for resize event so screen plugin never sees them wkwebview does seem to immediately report correct values for document documentelement clientheight and document documentelement clientwidth so maybe those could be used for mobile devices cordova mode since they don t have scrollbars that affect layout anyway probably wouldn t want use these on devices that do have scrollbars though since will differ from window innerheight and window innerwidth

nav used for tabs cannot contain a custom component which directly returns a navitem
react bootstrap beta 10 version added touch support in carousel component but the direction of slide navigation is right on right swipe and left on left swipe
when using form control with html5 validation i e uncontrolled react input components the event target being propagated when clicking on the submit button is the same as event currenttarget instead of originating from the button event target should reference button element that originated submit of form while event currenttarget points to form element as it has onsubmit listener attached to it

i have a multiple drag source and a drop area which accepts one of the types i expected that collect function of drop area should be called only for accepted types this behavior makes me do some redundant if else clauses and causes re renders of drop area according to the docs this drop target will only react to the items produced by the drag sources of specified type
the props variable in all callbacks e g begindrag candrop or drop only contains properties that are actually passed in the original object if a high order component url is used the properties from that hoc url are missing

deferred inner observables continue to execute even when the outer observable it depends on has no subscription left this was seen only with a non asynchronous scheduler please forgive me if it s not an issue in your opinion but after giving it some thought i don t really see any advantage to this behavior
when using startwith inside of pipe the argument type is not validated and or the return type may be incorrect

we want to upgrade to rxjs 6 and therefore migrated to the pipeable operators as described in rxjs v5 x to v6 update guide url we faced twice the issue that the switchmap operator does not work correctly and does not fire an event as a solution we had add tap operator before make the switchmap operator fire an event and yes we always subscribe observable
buffer drops last buffer on source complete js 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
when we add a trailing coma to the arguments of combinalatest then combinelatest is flagged with deprecated type signature and lint errors appear along with deprecation notice
i have a timer and some other streams that touch this timer
sometimes expectsubscriptions counts unsubscriptions incorrectly i don t know what is the general rule when the incorrect behavior occurs please see the example
the changes in pr 3945 exposed a bug with typings for the first and last operators with those operators it s possible to specify a default and if one is specified its type is used to infer both the operator s input and output types and in doing so the inferred monotypeoperatorfunction type can be incompatible with source observable
array from set return empty rxjs umd min js version 6 es6 shim js v version
the find operator does not unsubscribe from the source observable when a match is found but rather only after the result observable is unsubscribed from this means that find true behaves differently from first and the behavior of first is better
the replaysubject takes a buffersize argument in the constructor when given a buffersize of 0 i d expect it to behave almost like a regular subject so does not buffer any values at all however there will be a buffer of length 1 and the replaysubject behaves as if buffersize of 1 was given this happens when omitting the windowsize parameter
calling expectobservable adds tests to flushtests field and calling tobe on the expect marks those tests as ready then calling flush should go over flushtests and execute and remove those that are ready at this point the logic of removing is broken and different tests get removed than should be as a result some tests might never be checked some are checked multiple times the problem is that testscheduler flush is broken when removing items from flushtests it uses the index of item from before removal so for example if there are 3 ready1 ready2 notready then flush will execute ready1 then remove at index 0 so ready1 then execute ready2 remove at index 1 but now it s notready that is present at index 1 so after flush flushtests should be notready but in fact it ready2
observable of behaves like observable empty instead of observable of void 0
kinda related to 3890 when trying implement interop by accepting subscribable as input you cannot pass observable never into any subscribable t this is because subscribable s signature for subscribe doesn t match that of observable ts subscribe observerornext partialobserver t value t void error error any void complete void unsubscribable vs ts subscribe observer partialobserver subscription subscribe next value void error error any complete subscription so you get this argument of type observable never is not assignable to parameter of type subscribable number types of property are incompatible type observer nextobserver never errorobserver never completionobserver undefined is not assignable to type observerornext nextobserver number errorobserver number completionobserver number v types parameters observer and observerornext are incompatible nextobserver errorobserver completionobserver value v is not assignable to nextobserver errorobserver completionobserver undefined value not assignable undefined property complete missing in
when creating a new subject with a direct subscription on it subscription does not receive piped values only receives original next value
when running npm run test in master branch under docs app it throws errors
when doing a websocketserver next this is not being sent through the websocket connection
this is not correctly preserved when calling the observer error method presumably this affects next and complete as well
i upgraded an existing angular 5 project to angular 6 and changed everything to pipe operations the code snippet below has been reworked from before to after in chrome everything is working fine but in any other browser it is not working see the firefox console output in the additional context section
the creation of an instance of behaviorsubject requires to pass the initial value but this should be an optional parameter like in javascript
calling pipe method on a subject returns an anonymoussubject but according to the types it should be a plain observable firstly it allows a consumer to cast the object as a subject and access the next function secondly it prevents developer to avoid such problems by calling asobservable because typescript doesn t allow to call it on an object of type observable
some connectable observables when used as takeuntil notifiers seem to cause takeuntil s source observable to enter a sort of hung state where nothing will be emitted and in most cases no completion will happen either appears to only happen when the source observable is created after the notifier has completed
the follow code fails because the methods on the subscriber are not hard bound to it
ts const input observable number of 1 2 3 const output input pipe switchall output subscribe value console log value no type error but runtime error you provided 1 where a stream was expected you can provide an observable promise array or iterable
hi we are building a components that exposes rxjs observables for plugins to connect to our component is primarely used prebundled which means that our plugin creators might have double of some parts of rxjs though somewhat wastefull this worked fine with rxjs 5 but after upgrading to rxjs 6 things started breaking in firefox and chrome canary 69 here s the error message they get when trying to subscribe typeerror you provided an invalid object where a stream was expected you can provide an observable promise array or iterable which pointed at the subscribeto function where i suspect that this line is the culprit url l15 instanceof seems be a bit unreliable and appears work differently under the hood in each browser especially if class appears twice and originated from same source
when an error is thrown inside a switchmap pipe catcherror in the same pipe didn t catch that error
switchmap an ajax observer stop working even with piping catcherror outside
operators that return connectableobservable s ex multicast publish publishbehavior etc lead to type errors when used in v6 with the pipe function
when an object that is array like and has observable symbol observable from uses array like observable from mechanism before the observable symbol interop this is a problem in microstates because the symbol provides the proper mechanism to make a microstate treating it like an array does something very funky

having two modules with a matching starting name and one of them with a symbol makes one of the modules disappear
i did two things and failed at it and i m not sure if it s my fault or a bug in storybook first thing i converted my existing stories to the new component story format using the codemod in the migration guide this part worked mostly fine second thing i used an es6 proxy for the first time to toy around with proxies with goal of having a little bit nicer syntax for abstracting my story titles away and to avoid string interpolation precisely used group layout grid instead of hierarchygroups layout grid this causes storybook to fail with a typeerror cannot read property tolowercase of undefined was able narrow it down part where am using proxy can console log it in story and correctly say layout footer can also use in old storiesof format stories without any issues once use a default export like export default title group layout footer fails with error message above

storybook components is using an older version of react syntax highlighter that imports old versions of babel i believe it is missing a peerdependency on the package babel runtime that isn t getting resolved correctly the updated react syntax highlighter references babel runtime and therefore builds properly i ve tested this change and confirmed that builds pass however the react syntax highlighter api has changed so the component needs to be rewritten
the addon docs preview block has a withsource prop that can take the following values open closed or none the withsource none prop doesn t seem to prevent the block from trying to load source code and displaying a message if it s unable to load it
when i change contexts the component story does not refresh to reflect the change i have to select a different component for the change to take effect
if i write stories that use the contexts addon and then switch to a story that does not the toolbar icon persists if i load a story that does not use contexts add on first the toolbar icon is not present so i would expect it to go away when the process is reversed

there is a section below the preview screen intended to have additional panels which at the moment i m not in the need of using this panel cannot be collapsed it doesn t disappear on its own and the information no panels available is not particularly useful this wouldn t be a problem if it panel could be somehow dismissed but as it is now it makes very uncomfortable to work with console open as multiple menus end up taking too much space and this makes difficult to work on use cases involving a large screen i ve been working out through this by opening container iframe in a new tab but is hacky at best as not default behavior of application nor an available option feature in ui

when a component is class specified and that component has its change detection strategy set to onpush see additional context below the user is unable to manipulate the component s inputs using the knobs add on i believe this issue is almost certainly due to angular angular 14087 but i think there are ways we can work around it such as manually triggering change detection when a knob is changed clarification by class specified i mean that the component specified in story definition using mycomponent referencing s class directly rather than template my my referencing in a template via its selector
a receive a runtime error and see the empty storybook state when attempting to use it with next js the additem function in the vendor bundle is exceeding the call stack some sort of inifinite loop

with ssr this code html script x script x compiles to this js x get store value x let is used before it is declared and so it crashes it does not work with an actual store either

i have trained a model and then i 2 versions of frozen graph 1 version 1 single placeholder which takes in tfexample and rune the parseexample operator and does inference 2 version 2 instead of single placeholder i have about 300 placeholders one placholder per feature i e since the features are already parsed do not create tfexample but rather feed in individual tensors e a feed dictionalry where for each feature column feed in the respective tensor the number of ops in both graphs are approximately same multiple placeholders being slightly less 5 6k ops nodes latency of version 2 is 3x higher then version 1
the output difference is non zero

imagine you extend the tf keras layers layer with the class mylayer which is a wrapper for the tf keras layers dense layer class this class extension could also be a model but that s not important now imagine you instantiate a dense layer dense w no bias and initialize two independent mylayer instances dense1 and dense2 using dense now we extend the model class to take two mylayer instances on init we do this because we want to use dense1 and dense2 to perform different tasks but we want their weights to be shared in a realistic example mylayer would be split into mylayer1 and mylayer2 which would perform different operations on call but would both depend on run data through our model pipeline compute loss gathering gradients by using either gradienttape or keras optimizers however when gather apply gradients with respect model trainable variables even though our has one unique weight kernel for trainable variables will return two variables gradients will be calculated thus applied twice which i would say is bug insofar as it s unexpected

files generated by tf data dataset cache consume considerably more disk space than the original tfrecord files e g mnist from tensorflow datasets uses 21mb split into 10 files tf data dataset cache generates a single file with size 45mb is there a specific reason why tf data dataset cache files use a lot more disk space and don t split the into chunks this might be acceptable for mnist size datasets but when using imagenet tf data dataset cache will create a single file with well above 350gb vs 144gb of original tfrecords

tensorflow version changes the relative call order of building the model and the set model callback in the tf keras fit generator path as of commit cd701ec in r version branch keras engine training py make train function adds optimizer update ops aka backward prop phase and fills out model s graph callbacks that need full graph visibility need their set model function called after full graph is created order of operations are as follows tf keras fit 1 make train function 2 set tf keras fit generator 1 set 2 make train function team fit 1 make train 2 team generator 1 2 tf generator path stands out as being different from rest commit url fixed this for non eager mode case and added a test case to help prevent future regression commit url diff regressed this order and also removed test case that was intended to catch regressions another side effect of current code is that is called from on batch so in path this is now being called on every iteration while majority guarded by a check that won t do actual work there are somethings in method will run waste cycles on every iteration

using an op decorated with tf custom gradient prevents the tf graph it was created in from being garbage collected later so if a script creates multiple such graphs in a row it will use more and more memory unnecessarily i believe it s due to the graph being held as an indirect reference to the custom gradient registry

if i use a different configuration on saved search and on dashboard then the selected fields of saved search are used instead of the shown fields on dashboard example saved search field hostname is selected saved search embedded on dashboard ipaddress is selected i expect to see timestamp and ipiddress in csv when exporting dashboard level but the csv contains timestamp and hostname it doesn t matter if i save the or if i do column changes without saving but expect that it should work without saving
logstash configuration management api accepts adding a pipeline containing on it s name but kibana ui does not accept this
when you are searching multiple indices and they are using a mix of date and date nanos the sort order is not correct the reason is that the internal representation is a long since the start of epoche for both but because of different precision this doesn t sort correctly elasticsearch has added a workaround for that in version with an option numeric type date nanos url sorting numeric fields to cast everything to nanosecond precision

kibana is fast yet saving an object like a search can take upwards of 45 60 seconds creation of a new space takes a similar amount of time however if we create the space manually via es not through kibana post kibana doc space space test 1 etc the is created very quickly why is doing the same thing in kibana much slower than doing it directly to es is there anyway we can speed up creation and object saving in thank you

we use apache2 basic auth with ldap to protect the access to kibana the apache is acting as a reverse proxy to local kibana which connects to aws elasticsearch it was working fine until we added new index in elasticsearch for cloudwatch logs cwl after that the default index did not persist filebeat between users and browser sessions and users had manually chose the default index for each session after thorough investigation we found out that all requests from kibana elasticsearch contained authorization header because it was set by apache basic auth endpoint retrieve indices was failing because it expected additional tokens in authorization header which were not provided by apache2 by default solution was unset authorization header after basic auth authentication and before is sent kibana and elasticsearch using apache2 directive requestheader unset authorization

when using the mixer zipkin adapter with jaeger collector as zipkin service mixer sends its generated spans to the same jaeger collector instance it seems like the zipkin reporter is reusing the tcp connection to jaeger collector as long as possible this makes it hard to horizontally scale jaeger collector as at most one instance is used per mixer instance even worse when multiple mixers and collectors are in play collectors can go unused a possible solution might be customizing client used in zipkin adapter s reporter url l91 to break up connections regularly

cross cluster calls ignore virtualservices in destination clusters ex an in mesh call from servicea clusterx to serviceb clustery routes directly to serviceb instead of using virtual service rules configured for serviceb this appears to be an artifact of the envoy configuration in the istio ingress gateway which routes global requests directly to envoy clusters which translates a service in k8s the virtualservice configuration is written the ingress envoy s other normal gateway configurations as dynamic routing rules ex if i connect virtual service a gateway on port 80 virtualservice config becomes dynamic routing rule config on port 80 envoy proxy this doesn t happen for global even if i directly connect virtualservice global gateway istio creates for multi cluster routing

istio is prone to missed configuration where the missed configuration works perfectly in kubernetes environment but doesn t work in istio environment and there is no reliable way of debugging or prevent this for example if a container has no ports defined istio essentially doesn t proxy any ports however it still allows consumers to connect to the port when mtls is enabled the consumer will attempt to connect w tls the producer port is not proxied and expecting plain text in strict mtls producer port shouldn t even be accessible however at same time istio authn tls check shows no conflicts and indicated that mtls effective when it s really not

i m not sure if this was as designed or a bug but it seems inconsistent so i went with a bug when viewing the edges in the graph view there are inconsistent line weights probably 60 or 70 percent of the edges seem to be displayed with a very light font the other 30 40 percent have a darker line weight i can t determine any reason why sometimes weights are darker vs lighter darker line weights are ok lighter line weights are very light and difficult to see if your vision is not perfect even darker have pretty thin weight but extra light color along with thin weight make thin lines fairly difficult to see i put few screen shots below to demonstrate this bug at first thought different jump conditions determined if edge lines were dark or light but it doesn t appear be that case

when a scalar value field is defined on a type i e country string and a type exists in the schema with the same name i e type country and a query is made prisma will initially try and resolve country as country type and then try to resolve it as string this seems to have started happening after updating to the most recent update from version beta 2 to reproduce
using datamodel version a new field using id strategy sequence is successfully deployed to the prisma server but no column is created and errors are thrown when creating new objects of affected type to reproduce
calling prisma init on existing database generates an error typeerror cannot read property type of undefined to reproduce

we have a use case where there are two tcp services say servicea and serviceb that map to the same pod and port this is recognized as a conflict url l529 l538 when building the inbound listener map for the pod in itself this isn t an issue since both tcp services expect the same protocol problem is that when this inbound listener map is constructed service that wins conflict is flapping between servicea and serviceb so when inbound listener map pushed down to pod sidecar listeners get destroyed and recreated which in turn destroys in flight connections since this service a database we use connection pooling disruptive

the main scrollback buffer isn t erased this is probably somewhat related to issue 3545 i think the alt screen technically has its own scrollback even though it s zero length and it s that empty buffer that is being erased when ed3 is executed it might be better if the alt screen shared the same buffer as main screen

when switching to the alt buffer in conhost we reset all those properties producing the following results the start text is in the top left corner margin text is at bottom of screen tab text is in column 9 cursor is visible here s what our output looks like image url reason for this behavior because these properties are part of screen information class and alternate buffer implemented as a separate instance of that class when it should really be sharing much of that state with main buffer scroll margins are a little more complicated since those properties are also duplicated in adaptdispatch class and this can result some weirdness when switching to alt buffer since two sets values can end up out sync

it seems that the terminal is unable to handle the fast large amount of text output from the find command looking at the time that tmux shows in bottom right of screen it can be minutes behind in rendering text output other notes running in tmux locally without going through ssh it takes 2 seconds for a ctrl c to come through running without tmux locally without going through ssh ctrl c is immediate running without tmux but with ssh executing a find on a remote linux server it takes about 5 7 seconds for ctrl c to come through so seems only combination of being connected to another server ssh running a there and then having lot of text output causes issue where terminal is very far minutes behind with rendering text output

following the pattern described in the select api docs create a select item and use listsubheader to create categories non native observation 1 if the select does not have a value then the label of bottom listsubheader appears resolved issue was that a property wasn t being passed in so a string concat became undefined or undefined not matching values in list including empty value observation 2 listsubheader rows are clickable and fire click event meaning they can be selected or they can fire an onchange event

equipment iphone 8 safari ios version suggestions in the listbox are very difficult to find when using ios voiceover safari when swiping forward from the text field or the combobox voiceover skips over the listbox altogether and moves past it to next content on page focus on textfield image url then focus on background elements after swiping forward image url to find suggestions user must explore by touch and search screen xa8c which they might not know they should try issue appears to be aria owns not working properly in ios voiceover safari in combination with listbox portal being placed at end of dom as a result listbox is separated from input field for user problem does not exist with talkback on android where aria owns has better support

1 in the demo for multiple values url multiple values i cannot access the x button with the keyboard i don t understand why it has tabindex 1 as there doesn t seem to be an alternate way to reach it 2 in the same demo i can highlight chips with arrow keys but then space enter re open menu i think this could be fixed with an onkeydown handler on chips which would trigger ondelete and stop propagation understand that can use backspace to remove last chip however since can highlight chips with arrow keys should also be able to remove them
the attributes aria activedescendant and aria controls do not fully conform with the wai aria design pattern url combobox the aria controls attribute on the input is set to listbox id from beginning even when listbox is not present in dom when combobox is closed activedescendant attribute on input is still set to id of last focused option in listbox there are two errors in react axe caused by this attributes must conform to valid values 2 instances i m a little bit unclear on actual user impact but any divergence from design pattern increases risk for screen reader bugs
assigning a unique id to the textfield inside the autocomplete which is necessary for accessibility does not work the for attribute in the label refers to id provided to textfield but actual input ends up using a completely different id generated by autocomplete as a result association between label and input is broken for screen readers it also generates an error when testing with axe form elements must have labels i was able to work around problem by using inputprops on textfield and setting id manually but it should not be necessary

the buttongroup does not pass the correct styling to custom buttons image url left is a button right is a custom button
if you use an autocomplete with freesolo the onchange is never fired unless you click one one of the predefined autocomplete items or clear the field so you can t actually use it like a search field etc because the component using it never gets field s value additionally even if you type out one of predefined items onchange is not fired unless actually click select autocomplete item this is mildly strange for normal autocomplete where it clears text but feels completely broken when using freesolo where text is not cleared and expect value has changed

when migrating from semantic ui to material ui we expected to make it by parts each file separately change from semantic to material ui in a simple component that used the semantic button we changed it to the material ui button when we import the button and use it the console throws error as follows uncaught invariant violation element type is invalid expected a string for built in components or a class function for composite components but got object i feel that this specific behavior is weird because if i remove button in component it will not throw this error also importing without using works
the console log in the usestate inital value callback should only be executed once but when you open the popover you get two messages in the console this behavior is consistant with all other hooks which lead me to guess there is a duplicate copy of popover children running in parallel this will only happen in strcitmode if you render regular mode it will only console log once
clicking the delete button for an option in the multiple values and fixed options examples removes whatever is first in the last

right now operator key is documented to create a null key in the called upon json object should key not exist in that object if the source object is not const if the object is const operator returns the equivalent of map cend i think documentation around this could be improved as i would bet users are not fully aware of behavioral differences depending on const ness of source
recently merged pr 1436 introduced quadratic complexity in destruction of json object due to use of std vector reserve in a loop
project bad json parsers url tested how json parser libraries react on deeply nested inputs it turns out that this library segfaults at a certain nesting depth i analyzed the result and it turned out that the segmentation fault does not occur in the parser construction part but rather during destruction but avoiding destruction i e by adjusting the program as follows cpp include iostream include cstdlib include json hpp for convenience using json nlohmann int main void tauto j parse std cin tstd cout j type name std endl t exit 0 library can process much longer inputs and greater
backslash in field value of json file causes an exception
parsing fails for number literals beginning with 0 e g time stamps program crashes with following error terminate called after throwing an instance of nlohmann detail parse error what json exception parse error 101 parse error at line 1 column 16 syntax while parsing object
when including json hpp if the include directory is marked as a system include isystem rather than i it will fail to build i have to turn on cmake no system from imported and force the include path to be used as i instead of isystem isystem is used whenever nlohmann is provided as part of an imported cmake target this happened to me due using nlohmann from hunter with llvm for windows

i m not totally certain if this is a bug or just an oddity i don t understand but calling python s print function on a gpu tensor uses a lot of gpu memory that s probably a reasonably low priority bug by itself but it s also kind of strange one so i thought i d raise it in case it s indicative of something else going wrong somewhere

trigger a update of the snap package it seems that nodejs server runs in a timeout because the mongodb server is not not seems to be ready fast enough the rocketchat server does probably not wait long enough to be connected to mongodb probably there is a trivial fix in just increasing connection pool timeout values or re trying forever to get a mongodb connection

there seems to be another instance of the develop docker image being built from an older commit this was reported on 13264 for a different set of commits i believe sampaiodiego found it was linked to an end to end tests issue so just giving the heads up that the current image is based on a commit dated oct 31 when the most current one per my last backup is nov 11 my thought is that this could cause some really nasty regressions and again i understand this is a develop version but if it being published it would probably be something to check
here is 2 bugs with avatars that got from ldap active directory 1 bug when fileupload storage type is set to filesystem enabled accounts avatarresize rotate some photos to 90 degrees when accounts avatarresize is disabled photos is in normal orientaion but slightly compressed vertically 2 bug when fileupload storage type set to amazons3 minio which configured and works normally itself and when accounts avatarresize off accounts avatars apears to be broken that broken avatar 0 bytes size in minio storage avatarresize enabled avatars created successfully but with bug 1 some photos are rotated 90 degrees
custom authentication service creates accounts although this is prohibited by the settings it is security issue for us because we create users in rocket chat by native ldap with active directory security group filter that creation allows you to bypass this filter
the auto translate will not work for new translation language and it always get the previous translation language from the cache which leads to inconsistency in translation
the messages on ui are cached this prevents the re computation of auto translated messages therefore when the re render of translated message happens the original message has to be replaced by translated message reason key for each cached message is msg id updated id so translated with same key exists already in cache and therefore will be ignored

on busy site auto pruning is causing heavy cpu usage the usage grows over time until rocket chat eventually becomes unusable and instances of rocketchat and mongodb need to be restarted i have a rather active install with up to 200 active users at once and about 6 000 total users this was not an issue until i upgraded from version version to version version i use a short retention policy to keep the database small 1 day for room and 7 days for channels it may be relevant that i also upgraded mongodb from 4 during this install upgraded npm from during this install as well

current desktop client behavior for ctrl k or cmd k brings up the channel search dialog the problem is that key sequence in most other applications including web browsers would normally kill the current input my typical usage is to ctrl a ctrl k to kill what i was typing and start over if we can t change this default ideally there would be a way to specify different keyboard shortcuts in a config file or preferences w in the applicaiton

i have a public installation with around 2000 users per week many of these use anonymous accounts to login when starting the server rocketchat and mongo uses 10 memory this increases each day the server is running and after a week the memory usage has risen to 50 this continues until the server crashes a few weeks later i have also noticed some anonymous user accounts being stuck in list of users for a channel even when user hasn t used chat for several weeks to try and amend this i have tried deleting user accounts through api regularly but this causes issues as well because user delete action consumes lot of cpu power which ultimately crashes installation as well when deleting many accounts

this is similar to issue 6481 and pr 14275 however those did not quite fix the issue for me we have connected our saml environment to rocket chat to allow users to log in however the current configuration doesn t allow us choose a globally unique and or immutable identifier as primary id perhaps it s called immutable field name in rocket chat the latest implementation in 14275 allows you choose between username and email for immutable field name but both of those can change at times and should we have a staff id that is unique across all of our organizations i believe many other organizations would have this as well this id doesn t change even if someone gets married or changes their name is there a way use that identifier identify the rocket chat user account

how do you use storybook with a angular 5 project angular cli version angular version
hi i m currently trying to develop an hybrid addon working on both storybook web and storybook in react native everything worked fine until i used useaddonstate it still work in web but i get the invalid hook call hooks can only be claled inside of the body of a function component error when it run on the react native app
all titles inherit a position relative in the doc tab this can be a problem in certain context where a previous component has an absolute position
the css resources tab does not consistently display the css resource selections specified in the global storybook config js file on initial launch the css resources tab is entirely empty subsequent refreshes have no effect only way in my experience so far to force css resources tab to display anything is to purposefully create an error in one of story files and then fix error browser will refresh with resources available a subsequent browser refresh however will cause them to disappear yet again
we ve run into an issue where a story for a set of radio buttons on the docs page do not work if you visit the same story in the canvas page first after a bit of digging we ve noticed the component is still in dom when flicking over to docs page i noticed that div id root element has hidden true set when flicking to docs which might be cause of problem this appears to be same for any component but because we have custom styles for our radio buttons and duplicate id s exist in dom we ve noticed it heavily with them example have in our stories radio buttons basic invalid disabled if i select basic story i see three radio buttons as expected under canvas tab if i then flick to docs tab basic story section of doc does not select when click them if you then refresh page or load straight into basic on issue goes away because there s only one instance component existence

currently to view the crdb internal node statement statistics virtual table the query must be issued by a root user or a user with an admin role a proposed workaround is to create a view on non system database and grant select priveledges for sql user to query the view currently we check permissions when populating the table instead of when referencing it which in turn throws this error pq only users with admin role are allowed to access application statistics

enerprise database backup and restore doesn t honor table partitioning
currently our enterprise backup will backup an empty database to an s3 bucket but will run into an error when trying to restore for example if you backup defaultdb pq no tables found database defaultdb this presents a problem for those running a script that runs a show databases command and then backs up all of them and at a certain point in time then restores all of those backed up as we are aware the backup restore works on database level so one can cherry pick those that they know are not empty but this is not strong solution setting up exclusions for defaultdb and postgres databases will also not suffice as we ve seen use case from one of our customers where there are multiple other user created databases that are just left empty

when mdx content is being converted to a react component it s wrapped in the layout url components this is fine for pages where page context is required but turns out it happens for imported md content too and therefore when trying to embed another mdx file in existing content it tries to build the whole layout inside the imported mdx component
when importing svg elements into docz mdx files rendering those svgs returns an error like so invalidcharactererror failed to execute createelement on document the tag name provided data image svg xml base64 is not a valid name just a note i am unsure if it s my setup is wrong but from reading other issues here i assuming you can import svg s into considering svgr is included in the core
when importing a component from a index tsx file in a index mdx at the same location it crashes with element type is invalid expected a string for built in components or class function for composite components but got undefined you likely forgot to export your component from the file it s defined in or you might have mixed up default and named imports

the default mapping of a map using upload geojson vector file does not permit a join field in the vector shapes layer indeed to do a join we need to keywords field one from the map the other from data logs etc but with current auto mapping this keyword field is in field name keyword in query we use include term but include does not work on name keyword does not return

the filters selected by the user are not being supplied to the query responsible for providing the monitor list
the route changes from the given monitor page to the home page when the app autorefreshes
the columns in the app are mostly good but the monitor history table should have its ip addresses right aligned per url

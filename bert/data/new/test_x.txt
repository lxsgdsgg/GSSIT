in url we added request host to the expression for destination service labels this was added as a fallback for cases when destination service host would not be set pass thru blackhole nr in theory this is a nice idea however this is problematic at ingress as the host header can be set to arbitrary values example of sending such a request curl verbose header host 22 3e 3cscript 3ealert qualys xss joomla version 3c 2fscript 3e gateway ip no route this results in metrics with a destination service label containing junk some of it potentially harmful example from prometheus image url is problematic for number of reasons allows arbitrary explosion of cardinality metric as bad actors could send an unending stream requests with all different headers pollution the service variables in grafana dashboards potential xss etc when rendering metrics with bad request

this is similar to issue 6481 and pr 14275 however those did not quite fix the issue for me we have connected our saml environment to rocket chat to allow users to log in however the current configuration doesn t allow us choose a globally unique and or immutable identifier as primary id perhaps it s called immutable field name in rocket chat the latest implementation in 14275 allows you choose between username and email for immutable field name but both of those can change at times and should we have a staff id that is unique across all of our organizations i believe many other organizations would have this as well this id doesn t change even if someone gets married or changes their name is there a way use that identifier identify the rocket chat user account

every time i log into my gogs server i am redirected to a 404 web page this is caused by the fact that i don t have a custom css when ever i load the login page the browser tries to load the custom css which does not exists thus server responds with an 404 web page setting redirect to which because am not logged is redirected to login page so every time load login redirect cookie gets value 252fcss 252fcustom css security concerns since redirect cookie can take any value someone might find a way exploit it and redirect a logged in user any get request

i originally discovered this while trying to put a tabs inside a card body but from looking in the source i found that the underlying problem was caused by the nav code that tabs uses internally in particular it s this part of nav js url l109 l135 javascript let cardheaderbsprefix const cardcontext usecontext cardcontext if navbarcontext else if cardcontext cardheaderbsprefix cardcontext return abstractnav classname classnames classname cardheaderbsprefix variant cardheaderbsprefix perhaps card header should provide its own context type so the nav code could look for that one instead of url operating system n a browser version n a react bootstrap version v version beta 14

providing code for this issue is not immediately relevant here because i have a working build and a non working build where the only difference is that the broken build uses typescript tsx and the non broken build uses js files meaning that the problem can only be related to config and typescript compilation hopefully this is just a stupid mistake i made i will provide a code sandbox if no issue is identified at first glance in tsconfig

we have a use case where there are two tcp services say servicea and serviceb that map to the same pod and port this is recognized as a conflict url l529 l538 when building the inbound listener map for the pod in itself this isn t an issue since both tcp services expect the same protocol problem is that when this inbound listener map is constructed service that wins conflict is flapping between servicea and serviceb so when inbound listener map pushed down to pod sidecar listeners get destroyed and recreated which in turn destroys in flight connections since this service a database we use connection pooling disruptive

what did you do describe in your own words i load data to a table load like batch insert a large number of rows which has auto increment after 25hours later the replica running gc old version for the table but there are too many version and when running gc we copy all version into memory i known auto increment is not recommended in cockroach but i think it is a bug and i found another problem when a key has to many version to gc more than 256kb it will increase normal read and write request latency in that key since the latch if possible provide steps to reproduce the behavior 1 set up cockroachdb cluster 2 send sql cli command 3 look at ui log file client app 4 see error

installing non latest versions should not ship both versions of material ui styles i know that this can be resolved by tweaking the webpack configuration to tell it to load the correct version but we would prefer to actually fix this issue solutions i can think of export stylesprovider from material ui core this is the only reason why we have material ui styles as a dependency we import other style related references from material ui core styles such as withstyles muithemeprovider createmuitheme etc this would be our preferred solution unless it s already importable from core and i missed it somehow make styles a peer dependency of core instead of a regular dependency so that one and only one version gets installed by consumers

this sample code demonstrates the feature working correctly because it is implemented with ionic react version url the sample code implements a component with a leaflet map react leaflet on a tabbed page this is pertinent because leaflet maps can render incorrectly in a react environment e g if not completely visible when rendering the supported way around this is to invoke the invalidatesize method on map element which can be accessed from react once your page is visible hence need to access map element from function bound to useionviewdidenter see effect of not calling invalidatesize by commenting out line 10 in page1 js to see effect of trying run this with ionic version you would need copy code elsewhere since at time of writing version version wasn t available in stackblitz workaround bind leaflect map element global window variable instead of using usestate setter but not ideal
expected behavior would be that the position of the dropdown would match the location of the select element and display correctly

the pr url fixed some issues with read only muted of a room unfortunately this fix introduced a side effect that may not be intended let s assume the following use case action effect read only muted unmuted chat x has participant random dude it s newly created everybody can send messages false random dude sends spam therefore gets muted everybody but the random dude can send messages false random dude after stopping spamming gets re activated everybody can send messages false now the entire chat needs to be muted for some time moderator sets it to read only nobody except can send messages true in my humble opinion marked states are quiet odd that means once a user gets re activated user is able to even if entire room gets even if user kicked its username remains in room unmuted array this is very error prone because moderator doesn t see which users still are able to
it should undo the action just completed

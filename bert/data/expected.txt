just change visibility of listitem name to invisible when parent is external storage to avoid showing 0, because it is not intuitive
in the last step, it should keep the lastselecteddate as selected
the dialog should not crash at least
the dialog shouldn't dismiss or is there any other flag to prevent autodismiss on outside dialog touch ?
a clear description of what you expected to happen.
this is my use phofcode but "dialogwrapcontent = true" is not working, i hope the dialog would wrap the content width
library should parse html tags even if you set text as string
i have a dialog with bottomsheet behavior.
i set a `edittext` to it using `input()`.
when i show the dialog, the soft keyboard immediately shows, which moves the dialog to the top as keyboard is drawn below it.
i want to: 1. prevent soft keyboard from automatically opening when dialog with input is shown.
2. change drawing behavior so that keyboard is drawn on top of dialog (overlaying it), rather than below it.
the top should have the corner radius set to 16dp.
dialogscrollview with zero bottom padding, if `noverticalpadding = true`.
is there a way to control this?
at the moment, i am using: { setpadding(0, 0, 0, 0) }`
check this old issue: phofurl i would expect that the above dimension is public or that i get a flag like described in my old issu
it should popup the paste option
expected behavior is that corner radius is applied to dialogs.
instead, it doesn 't work at all.
if corner radius is set in code via `cornerradius()` method applied to materialdialog instance, it does work.
i guess other themes attributes also don 't work
show the modifications after doing them (for example, show the new text/image
android 4.3: background color of bottomsheetdialog should be translucent, like in materialdialog android >= 5.0: statusbar color should be translucent, like in materialdialo
when clicking the button, instead of showing the sheet always, it shows only the first time.
the other times the screen darken itself but sheet never appears.
if i remove behavior, everything works correctly, but as a dialog

a clear description of what you expected to happen
dialog with message only set to appear as before
text gravity should be at end the issue is with the following code in `dialogactionbutton` phofcode the `setgravityendcompat` is only setting the `textalignment` and not the gravity, i think you should be setting `textalignment` to `gravity` and set `gravity`to the proper value (because `update` method is called several time during flow, and first with `stacked=false`, so `gravity` is set to center, thus making button text centered.
manually setting gravity fixing issue phofcode thanks
positive button not change when color is selecte
be able to select multible choices and then click choose button like the screen shots
i expect that the value of the button text changes to what i set it to in ondismiss(), but that doesn't happen because it says the button is null
the negative option should have focus by default, you shouldn 't be able to lose focus by clicking up, down, or left on the dpad.
right on the dpad should move to the positive option
hopefully, all iphone systems will be able to use this component

as in firefox and safari, i would expect the cookies to be set.
after adding 1,2,3 or even more cookies with various httponly true/false), axios continues to ignore the set-cookie on the two browser platforms.
fiddler shows a request to phofurl
i expected the import to work.
i found a stackoverflow question related to this here: phofurl following this i created `src/types/axios.d.ts` with the following contents: phofcode and this seems to fix the issue but i consider it a workaround and it would be nice to have axios contain typescript type definitions for all the types it defines.
or the ability to use another config option to pass custom data.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the method specific headers should be merged in with the headers before setting content-type if not set.
the json response should be parsed and returned as typeof response.data === 'object ' (or whatever the response was)
`test-header` is useful , but `content-type` is ignored.
the `geturi` method always returns the full url of the request config
a way to support xdomainrequest.
or must lock the version ?
post request to work of course :)
the request should use the `url` property if present and absolute.
alternatively, the documentation should reflect that `baseurl` is required to use `instance.request()`.
i didn't expect a minor version change to break existing code.
is there any further guidance or documentation regarding these changes?
- makes axios error generic to use axiosresponse (#1738) - suman lama - adding isaxioserror flag to errors thrown by axios (#1419) - ayush gupta
throw an error with status code properly
according to the docs, all configuration options are * merged * .
phofurl i expected request to contain both `q` and `page` params.
this is also how it was working in version 0.18.0, which is how i noticed.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
`content-type: application/json` header should be set as default for object data, without charset parameter.
well before it was turned into jsx the axios.post was working now it is not.
i was hoping it would continue working.
however barring that is there some type i have to set somewhere?
if a socket stops writing for long period of time, the request should timeout.
nodejs get requests can detect this.
you need to use their `timeout` event instead of just using a timer.
i expected it to just tell me `headers cant be strings`, or `headers must be an object`, etc...
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
before set content-length header, axios should check if there is a case insensitive "content-length" header.
if there is an existing content-length header: compare with content-length calculated if dismatch throw error else set content-length header in axios

the 'content-type' header should always be what i set.

at least if the node is problematic, i expect the health endpoint to show error, cause i cant run any query to that node.
i wouldn't expect the exact same files open 46 times.
after an enterprise restore the data is distributed the same way it was when backed up.
potentially an empty database to be created and the script running this not to halt.
the creation of the index to finish within a couple of minutes and progress to show more accurate.
also when canceling the job to either have the addition of the index in background stop - although i imagine it has to reverse one another - or at least make it possible view status of canceling query somewhere.
@rolandcrosby pointed out that this should have failed at the outset since the rangefeed cluster setting was not set appropriately.
pg-dump file to load seamlessly.
a common sense dictates that we should have 3 replicas on the 3 live nodes.
however - this isn't also working in 19.1 so just fixing the bug in 19.2 won't get us to the common sense case.
19.1 is also badly behaving as it will get stuck and keep the ranges with 2 live and one dead replica.
the `rangefeeds require the kv.rangefeed.enabled setting` error should be returned to the user immediately, and a job should not be created
the index configured should be used, even when jsonb column is included in the output.
i was expecting to be able to leave my scripts running for about 22 hours and then have a week worth of data in cockroach so that i could start testing query performance.
expected behavior is to have backup created.
queries should execute correctly without any negative impact on cluster.
i expect the latest tag to be the latest stable version of cockroachdb
user set should not need defaultdb or the documentation should be updated that defaultdb can not be deleted for insecure(?)
expected the cluster to come up and run properly
the table descriptor should no longer be visible in the offline state as soon as the restore or import completes.
i expect the node process to terminate.
i expect the script to execute until the end without the server crashing.
delete should delete all matching rows as it does for other tables.
i expect both entries to be inserted.
since there is no conflict on the primary key, the upsert command should insert the second entry.
flag "--log-file-max-size" and "--log-dir-max-size" work for both main and secondary logger
reply with error sql syntax
compactions shouldn't be happening at such a frequent interval.
`roachprod stop` should only impact the crdb nodes, not other commands.
the commands should not be sensitive to the length of the environment.
maybe relying on `ps` is not the right way go to?
after decommission i would expect the cluster to trying to contact the terminated node.
new events in sentry should file github issues.
the original error should be preserved somehow.
for context, note that the specific example linked above phofhyperlink is from crdb 19.1; in 19.2 _for that case specifically_ the behavior is different, as follows: - the particular file `data.go` from that example now uses instead of `github.com/pkg/errors` and - the function `safedetails.redact()` in which is invoked in those cases, knows how to extract additional safe details from error causes.
so we 're expecting 19.2 to not produce detail-less reports for that particular case.
however, other error constructions points are still affected: - places construct errors with `%v` but without using - places construct a string with `fmt.sprintf` and then build an error out of there are several avenues to explore: mandate uses of with a linter audit code and replaces uses of `fmt.sprintf` with `errors.newf` where applicable (or using other constructors)
- the build should work without swap on a mid-range laptop with just 4 or 8gb ram.
the command to finish without exception as described here: phofurl however, i get exactly the exception which upsert should prevent...
we should fix the behavior and augment the test suite to exercise schema changes during rolling upgrades.
as a temporary workaround we could introduce a cluster setting or flag that disables schema changes (or blocks/suspends them) until an upgrade is finalized.
i expect the db to drop or at least there should be a * force * option to make it so.
normal decommisioning process usualy takes one hour at most at our size (7gb each node).
the test should execute in roughly the same amount of time regardless of the mechanism used for transaction retries.
however, the execution times differ by an extremely large factor.
the expected behavior would have been that the cockroach sql client only reads the required `client.<user>.crt/key` in the given `--certs-dir` while ignoring any other `.crt/.key` files.
i want to be able to run other workloads too.
node remains connected to cluster
expected the database to restore properly, without an error.
dropping index + table should finish without error.
this was the case up to v2.1.8 (i tested v2.1.2, v2.1.6, v2.1.8).
the error that should be thrown is: `pq: only users with the admin role are allowed to create database` this may cause confusion since as a core user, only the root user has the admin role, and granting roles is an enterprise feature.
might be possible to throw a different error depending on whether an enterprise license in enabled.
that the ddl statements would execute with no errors.
i expected the `quit` subcommand to block until shutdown completes, either optionally or by default.
i would expect a constant performance without any steep drops.
i studied the error code phofcode i understand that `slotidx` should start at 1, then we should use `slotidx-1` to access elements, such as the `setint64` method.
but the `settingchanged` and `setonchange` methods directly use `slotidx`, causing the array to be over bound.
the reason for this error should be because number of cluster settings we have registered this time reaches value set by `const maxsettings = 128`.
when accessing largest slotidx, it is `onchange[128]`, and an array error occurs.
so i modified 2 methods: phofcode and then i can build it successfully.
i would expect crdb not to hang up.
i expected the listening url file to be written out before control is returned to the shell.
if that's not possible, it'd be nice to clarify the `cockroach start --help` output.
db should use the default value provided and insert to row successfully.
in previous version i used (2.x.x) this or at least comparable example used to work.
the page should ideally render data in a few seconds rather than timing out when a user needs information about their zone configurations or data distribution
we expected no error to be shown for the described configuration.
ui stops functioning, because its api calls no longer succeed, because they can't authenticate, because the session no longer exists, because the user it is for has been deleted.
the cluster keeps on working and accepting data.
the readiness check should return 503 if the node is not in a state where it is capable of doing anything.
mvcc values should not be saturating a system range to the point that a cluster freezes up.
i would expect the last query to return only the `{foo, bar}` row, not both.
there shouldn 't a drastic change visible in the write throughput as experienced by the client!
expected behavior is that the json output would match that from the same query in postgresql.
based on the documentation here: phofurl the command show schemas; does not need any privileges.
i would expect this command show list of all schemas similarly as for the root user: schema_name +--------------------+ crdb_internal information_schema pg_catalog public (4 rows)
i expect this to return a result without crashing
ultimately, the ability to recover from this error or at least even see what the issue is.

re-adding a node should not result in cluster becoming unstable and node crashing.
index should complete without oom

same behavior as in the sql client of crdb.
ideally this would work without requiring user to escape the password.
at the very least the error message could be clearer.
minimal impact on latency and constant slope of rebalancing nodes.
warning should not be shown
we should push for consistent units and labeling on charts that have timeseries with similar metrics.
the above example represents clock offsets for each node; each line on the chart is measuring time, so we should have consistent units.
i would expect the query to always work or never work.
nodes should not go down - unless this import requires a larger memory footprint
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i have 4 views, each of which call each other.
each table involved has no more than about 20,000 rows currently.
progress to be made on the job and the job to have already completed.
the cluster is small so this should be a fast job: image phofimage
i'd expect these events to be labeled clearly
if this is related to phofurl (not key-encoding json values) then a clearer error message.
otherwise i would expect: phofcode
import completed without a crash.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
second `execute x` should fail to insert null value into a non-null column.
i would expect "foo" to equal the primitive value 'foo ' considering the other examples on that page yielded the same results between the two implementations in other cases i tried.
it should check the rest nodes to determine if it was the drifted one.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
import completed without a crash.
index < 10 minutes look at the front page on admin ui metrics sql qps and make sure it never went to less than 80% pre index
so it seems to me that the rust postgres driver is expecting a `int2` to be sent using only 2 bytes, and a `int4` to be sent using only 4 bytes, and complaining that it receives 8 bytes in both cases.
i'm not sure if it a violation of the postgres wire protocol to send a smaller intn as int8, but definitely cockroachdb is at least behaving differently from postgresql in this scenario.
the expected behavior is that the cancel command should stop the query.
i would expect that the second `select` from txn b would return exactly what the first `select` returned.

i would expect most of the webui to load
database should restore without error.
cockroachdb should compile from source on ppc64le

my expected plan is the following tree | field | description group | | aggregate 0 count_rows() scalar render scan table test2@test2_created_idx spans (7 rows)
resulting files in the zip should have timestamps equivalent to when they were actually created
i expected the query to complete successfully, with a result being a column with values 10 and 21 (as it does in postgresql.)
either a successful visualization or a better error message.
inactive nodes that are decommissioned should show as _decommissioned_ throughout the ui when accessing it from different machines.
all three servers in the cluster are using the same google ntp servers (time1.google.com time2.google.com time3.google.com time4.google.com) as their source, so i would expect them not to crash as a result of a clock synchronization error.
the request should be terminated immediately after the context is canceled.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i should see around 30 mib of data (x3 for replicas) for the usertable table.

i should get results back not an error.
the same statement on psql console with postgres database gives no error: phofcode
delete latency proportional to number of rows deleted.
i expect the original operation to be cancelled and an error not be printed to the logs.
i expected cockroachdb to understand that it's memory limit is 6.2gb not 7.3gb.
query finishes normally (60k rows of bool from false to true should not need that much ram?)

i know amd multi-gpu is not supported but i had a spare vega card and wanted to see if it would help at all.
with normal settings there was no big difference, i think instead of running at max 7.9gb/8gb the card would only use 7.4gb and 0.5gb of shared gpu memory.
i performance was slightly higher.
with ping pong think it was unknowingly dumping stuff from ram into gpu2 as a page file when switching sides.
the amount would still decrease and increase during iterations and the weird part is that after switching sides 2 times performance was much higher than when just starting up again from a reload.
compute load almost maxed out in the 95% 's it wasn 't doing any copying, compared to swinging between 25% to 50% compute copy load sitting at 50% when restarting.
this great until vram on gpu2 maxed out it crashed.
don 't know if this is related to hbm2 vega/radeon vii cards having a hbcc but seems possible.
if it 's possible get aware of shared gpu memory always use shared gpu memory over ram that would probably boost performance lot when using multiple amd cards big models.

you just can't remove a whole documentation for your api like that.
you can add the depecation but you can't remove it.
there is some people that will still need see this docs.
in case someone also search for this doc.
it builds from a clean state (like on ci builds)
i expect to be able to use docz v2 with my current cra `browserslist` setup
for it to run properly.
should work as expected, no error thrown.
i expected the page to re-render when clicking on the routes.
the proptypes description will describe the prop :
`react` & `react-dom` should only be in the `peerdependencies`
`ref` and `key` are omitted from generated props table
expected the playground to render a styled-component
expected to see the svg file, when i browsed to the page.
there should be a margin between the button and the title.
the browser only opens when the `-o/--open` flag is supplied
page is scrolled to top.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
i expect to see my test component displayed in docz app when running.
syntax highlighted code block should be shown
i expected the data from the index.mdx file to be present within the returned value of usedocs()
- docz should load without styles messed up
please note that `gatsby develop` works fine.
i would expect the props parser to find the .d.ts files and find the related prop types to be included in the docgen output.
the title link should respect the `basename` property from the router component, so in the above example it should link to `/foo/`.
freezing an object should not cause an error.
`<props>` component should work fine.
should link to documentation page "hello world"
docz server should start without an error
docz cli should exit with an error if the specified file can't be found
should generate the bundle similar to dev environment.
when i switched the docz version to `0.13.7` the same setup worked fine.
the `<link>` should be created within the `<head>` element.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
the button should use the post protocol instead of get to transfer the parameters data.
i expect the hamburger menu to open the sidebar
show available options for the enum
i would expect the dark background to extend beyond the content.
there should never be a white background in a dark mode.
*icon becomes visible when the text is hovered over to indicate the existence of the link.
not to have dev code in production
both examples above to work the same
the component in sandbox is rendering successfully.
will run package `build` and yield `dist`
the page to render normally * os: [e.g.
osx 10.13.4, windows 10] * node/npm version: [e.g.
the props table should render like below: (this only renders when i export the component without the hoc: `export default test`) <img width="931" alt="screen shot at 3 17 59 pm" src=" phofurl any kind of fix with using hoc 's would be helpful...
docz continues to build when using the latest version of webpack.
console should have no warnings.
i'd expect no animation when printing out ` creating production build`, which only works in tty
show show a blinking cursor.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
pretty straightforward: - up-to-date documentation.
- a package should install its dependencies.
1. the result does not include `react-error-overlay` and `react-hot-loader` 2. do not create websocket
the proptable should render someprop2 and prop1
i 'm not sure whether this is a bug of docz, but i guess it is because when i 'm running babel separately it works fine when the config is a js object and not json.
so i expect docz to work the same.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
the "edit page" button is not obstructed
expect that it should show `m1` and `m2` and then `m1`, but what we get is `m1`, `m2` being duplicated in the menu.
the following error trace is also shown in the console: phofcode
docz-theme-default is installed with the docz package or it is stated in the documentation otherwise
docz creates folder if needed.
`propstable` should render regardless of component returning null by default.
since the build command runs successfully, it should also run as expected.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..* start the doc server locally
the button is not overlayed
i would expect the same set of plugin plugins on every parsing of the mdx docs
render a map like it does in styleguidist
docz should return my stuff, as described in thegetting started page.
when you kill the docz cli parent process, it should also properly kill and cleanup any children processes it has spawned.
the plugin works inside and outside the `playground`
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..* i expected the svg tag mentioned to exist in the `head` and not in the `body`.
it should able to use `app` as component name in `playground`
`order` should be respected inside menu, and should go in ascending order
playground should render component accurately.
the page loads with the playground and any child elements.
styles from `docz-theme-default` should not impact on consumer components.
i can provide a pr for this if maintainers think this is a valid issue
either yarn or npm can be used in project
code is visible at all times without requiring the container to gain focus.
any component that has been built with babel-plugin be able to show in code sandbox
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..* i expect quitting the process to close all spawned subprocesses.
i know it 's doable to render nicer as the gitlab readme page looks just fine.
<img width="978" alt="screen shot at 9 56 00 am" src=" phofurl
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
text of link is displayed as header fix: change the code in the file i referenced above to this (in order to handle nested children): phofcode
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
navigate to the correct route using the `hashrouter`:
dev server to actually run.
*a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..*
it should go to the appropriate section
npm and yarn should install the same packages, or at least the npm one works properly.
i 'm expected to have header links in the sidebar and opened submenu after refreshing.
it should render the prop-types *a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..* n/a
render component normally or at least show an error message about the limitation
after reloading the page it should correctly display all created `.mdx` files that were created when `docz` is running.
override the index.html and insert roboto font.
copy `html` code to clipboard rather than `jsx` code.
it should show a component page
theme.colors.myfunction should exists and be a function theme.mb should exists and be a function
start the server as expected.
<img width="939" alt="screen shot at 19 11 11" src=" phofurl
if no order has been modified, everything should be sorted alphabetically.
it should show (for now doesn 't matter how), the information of the object *a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen..* maybe a text where the user click and it expands an inner table with the information of object
that the routes are served so they can be accessed from anywhere, not just from the sidebar navigation.
the menu should be opened.
otherwise it feels like the page does not belong to the web and you lose the track of where it comes from.
the page to load with no error.
some error message that helps with debugging the issue further
i expect the built static files to be written to `dist`.
the command should throw the error and exit.
instead, docz continues to run, (presumably) using the default config.
it should bootstrap the site and it should run
web component to work ;) ## enviroment windows 10 :( node 9.x npm 5+ ## docz mdx file phofcode
expect a hello dva page?
2. testcase 'should load app.js ' in fails with error message 'assertionerror [err_assertion]: can 't find string:"app is ready" in ... '
same as `npm run cov` when use `yarn run cov`
image phofimage 2. image phofimage
should pass all test cases
i can upload file whatever its name is
you only see server ip's from your range talking to anything other than your servers.
in my case i should see all of my test network talking to public ip's.
that is not the case though.
the apm ui should show the start of the span name and truncate at the end.
kibana shows up as expected
i would expect a switch to the edit mode
total size of this page is 76 mb.
~as to how its implemented in the client side, that might mean that the promise is rejected with an error object (and possibly also access to the origin `fetch` `repsponse` object), or promise resolved with an error object.~ > ~note: i noticed that there seems to be no way to access the `response` object by using methods.~
tooltip updates to reflect feature hovered over when moved between features
for 7.5 (and future 7.x versions), a deprecation warning should be logged but the setting should continue to work as it had before.
in 8.0, the deprecation logic can be removed so kibana fails to startup.
effectively, the breaking change happens in 8.0 rather than 7.x
should show the counts correctly per sub-aggregate that is added.
the first slice would be the totals with the second slice showing the sub-counts of previous slice.
so if first ring had 4000 in one slice and second ring has 4 sections with each count of 1000. the final ring might show 2 slices with count 500 per each of 1000 count slices in previous ring.
per space splash screen shouldn't have telemetry notice + telemetry shouldn't be space configurable?
kibana starts and logs `plugin "${name}" was disabled because it expected kibana version "${pluginversion}", and found "${kibanaversion}".`
see value ranges for each color.
they should see the opt in/out banner message and buttons or the message on the splash screen.
the thumbnails should show a preview of each asset.
the expression should be updated with the untranslated value of the position.
the behavior of the second one should be used when searching for "telemetry" while telemetry opting ui is disabled.
if the value is unset, kibana should send the json request with the value omitted.
if the value is set to 0, kibana should send json request with value set to 0.
kibana will navigate to the infra ui
in previous version (recent upgrade from 5.5.2 and 6.3.2), the embed=true removes header and nav drawer, as it still does when using the embed code => saved object method.
the map must colored because of the datas of the second index
the in-progress report should be listed as in-progress, or at least permit other reports to appear.
report generation should fail at once, possibly printing the error
the name should be truncated or wrapped, and the name shouldn 't affect the logout button position in the user popover.
filter bar shouldn't change size just by adding one filter to it.
i could change the settings, e.g.
setting the legenda on top, adjust grid and set values in bars.
whenever possible the siem ml jobs should use the built-in windows audit logs: creation"}}}} influencers should use the winlog.
* fields which are present on normal logs or the winlogbeat security module should be updated to properly pull those fields into ecs fields.
the uptime app's server code should simply use the getter function supplied as part of the request object.
when saving and reopening a visualization it should be saved with all the changes applied.
the table to preview a transform should have the same capabilities as the table for previewing source data.
the menu should open either at the point where the user clicks, or at the right border of the table cell
tips should be closed after clicking the collapse button
only see one of each pipeline.
user should be able to add both "closed" and "closed" to the filter same issue exists on the dashboard
the route will have an explicit path, rather than relying on `#`.
filters would be applied to the server.
there should be a panel in default uses of this chart
the visual 's payload is < 25mb, so it should save successfully.
it should not crash and just show double dashes.
correct warning bang that states something like `you need to update the index pattern by hand, the field is dynamic: false` and point to some documentation.
additional logs are added at the top or bottom of the log stream
the url generated would have a dynamic range where the 'now' is when the watch is ran.
this is exactly what happens when you are on a dashboard page and select: share -> pdf reports -> copy post url.
dashboard pdf report export url: ` phofurl
i would expect better feedback about the root cause.
in the case described above it is the file that is not resolving correctly.
getting into this error state is very unhelpful.
currently, for example, new platform migrations or instances of using `js` modules in `ts` modules can be very tricksy to debug.
i need to keep seeing ticks on that version
the session notification should be rescheduled when the session is extended.
the behavior on other pages (such as dashboard) is consistent with this expectation.
the discrepancy seems to be that behavior is different when api calls are made to "`/foo/elasticsearch/*`" routes, which successfully reschedule the notification.
kibana should show the session timeout warning notification on all pages.
i would expect applied filters on a visualization to also effect control drop down selectors.
transition links suppose to contain value of host.ip in the url as its happen when monitor.status:u
if we revert to the default moments.js format (i.e.
an empty string), we can see the expected behavior: <img width="1677" alt="screenshot at 10 25 57" src=" phofurl
anomaly explorer and smv anomalies table gets populated on clicking the "refresh" button.
this seems to graph as expected except for the the circles on each line graph.
these would typically be the same color as the line itself, but for some reason, all circles for all lines turn to black.
this happened back on 7.1.1 except instead of being all black, it would make circles completely random colors.
just refresh the fields and make them aggregate and searchable.
not sure whether we should suppress this error (if it 's not actually a problem) or if the ml jobs should be deleted when this error throws.
it should detect selected field value consistently and apply it to the anomaly table data.
when using the search bar `total events` and `bytes sent` should be the actual value based on the executed search.
alternatively, maybe add some new fields that show the values correctly.
when clicking on a time, log lines with the appropriate timestamp show up.
the minichart does not move at all.
the chart should display _something_, probably a gray ring.
the other bucket would work, even with scripted fields.
i can add a page even with autoplay enabled
deleted index names should not be returned when retrieving saved objects of type: index
i think when that customize toggle is switched we would want the slider to initially be on the same interval as was auto selected (in this case 30 seconds) but it's not currently possible to go less than `h` (hour).
the filter saves the value
error message to explain that search with wildcard is not allowed
1. all internal exceptions must be logged.
2. kibana should know how to handle the response from elasticsearch when a search with a scroll id is made, and the scroll context has timed out.
3. before trying to clear the scroll, kibana should make sure the scroll context is valid in elasticsearch.
if it is not, then forward error.
4. kibana could save any partial data that was generated before scroll cursor timed out.
there could be a new field in part of job payload metadata that can flag when a warning needs to be shown next to csv download, that it contains partial data.
all kibana-hosted functions and visualizations, be they 'native ' to kibana or developed using vega specifications, convert datetime data to local time consistent with the kibana management setting _timezone for date formatting_ (dateformat:tz)
the error stacktrace should be rendered
either the details page should load even without the indices present or there should be a delete button on the listing page
a map with data :)
the value for the parent control should stay empty and the associated filter pill should be removed
allow any combination of step and decimal values.
index pattern selection list should not be visible after collapsing the left hand panel.
should be able to see full index pattern name.
percentages between 0 and 100%.
this is what it looked like in 7.3.2 (notice the background is uniform), and what the expected behavior should be.
no warning should be logged
should use the `name` property on the series chart
throttling and something like "last message skipped 24213 times".
i guess mechanism would be useful in general
ideally, non-compatible fields for the selected aggregation wouldn 't be selected at all.
kibana recognizes change and issues request to sever that changes removed setting (sets it to `null`).
working index patterns after saved objects import.
loading a saved query should send a request for the entire query.
i should be able to use any of my saved queries, not just the first 20.
i am expecting the number to be formatted and the color change.
i am only able to have the color change or the number change, but not both.
the flyout should be displayed <img width="642" alt="bildschirmfoto um 14 47 43" src=" phofurl
no obvious problems to the user.
just errors in the browser console.
seeing the non-system indices to create an index pattern.
kibana returns a 302 redirect to `/qgv/api/status`.
only functions in the canvas doc to - be seen in autocomplete - be available for execution
wms layers should be able to load, regardless of access to default basemaps
filter ranges match the bucket bounds of the clicked bar.
i haven 't tested other visualizations but these should also work.
the editor tab should contain `<div>lorem ipsum</div>`
is this a bug or my config isn 't right?
> "view 1 occurrence in discover"
kibana loads in ms edge.
maps team needs to discuss and figure out if filter should get disabled when user accidentally starts zooming on the map.
tsvb legend order works fine, even for derivatives
i should be able to easily read the full elasticsearch error message.
lengthier messages are generated by elasticsearch which we will sometimes need to show as we cannot always anticipate all errors and write them as something neat and summarised.
the saved query should automatically be loaded and populate the query bar and add the filter.
* kibana user should login successfully and land on `dashboards` page.
the tooltip "filter out value" should appear.
it does but either disappears or flickers on and off (taking the icon with it)
the node to appear with the proper number of shards.
new user with sufficient role indices privileges and space features should be able to perform read access visualizations and dashboards against indices
`" "triple ""` should not be triple quote expanded.
when you click on a job id you are going to have the job id populated like so: <img width="1357" alt="screen shot at 11 20 55 am" src=" phofurl
i would expect the desired workpad to load in a new tab.
the chart should scale its domain and visualization to the size of the date range, for a uniform display.
remove selected columns on index pattern change if those columns don't exist on the selected index pattern.
the filters stay in lucene format or get translated.
the workpad should open normally
given the returned scroll context is never re-used by canvas, then the cursor should be closed by calling _sql/close before returning the results.
no deprecation warnings should be raised.
it 's z order and appearance is on-top of the search bar.
we don 't get any errors on job installs by either filtering them or calling a different api which does not report errors on job installs back to us for duplicate id 's.
no errors should show up and jobs should install fine.
sorting to correctly change to the correct field.
it appears that chart updates to reflect `body.senttimestamp` as the correct field but the table view continues to sort by the other field.
the server redirects to a correct route ` phofurl
the server returns 404 and doesn't run auth hook.
the index is populated and ready to continue with the layer workflow
screen shot is updated to latest looking ui.
the logs shouldn 't error
kibana should stop writing to `kibana.log.1`
mouse users probably wouldn't notice this problem but keyboard users would.
and it's going to be a pain to work-around each of these in test automation.
not to spam users constantly about not being able to install jobs that require more memory.
instead probably let the user know through another ui/ux friendly way they cannot run some of the jobs with only 1 gig of memory.
use 24hrs for the time range when selecting 6 months.
should maintain the relative date time when crossing over to the ml page.
reference to the code that shows absolute position phofurl
all saved objects, that uses name of index-pattern and not id continue to work after re-creation of index-pattern.
the background should be dark
responsive user interface --- the current user interfaces ensures the user provides an index pattern that matches an index.
its acting as a gatekeeper and if the gatekeeper isn 't working nothing passes.
perhaps we could modify the user interface so that its more passive and allows the to enter and create index patterns independent of index pattern list in browser.
i think we 'd still need to verify that an index exists but we could do that after clicks in 'next step '.
this would function but be slow, likely an acceptable compromise
the list of indices with conflicts should be listed.
they should fill in the kql search bar as well as choose the anomaly table by default.
you only get the specific host you 're looking at in the anomalies table.
the check up should not fail if the version does not follow the semver format (x.x.x).
it appears to happen in this part of the code where we try to detect old apm indices: phofurl this error could be prevented by: 1. filtering for apm patterns before checking the version 2. handling any malformed version numbers
custom notification banner should display
edit page should show up decodeuri is missing to change "test%20value" to "test value"
by default, the server.name is documented as being the hostname we should update the docker image to use the ${hostname} variable for consistency
update graphical element when data changed in index
some way to reset logs display settings.
the interval boundary selected as "now" adjusts to match the current time on every refresh or page reload.
we have another cluster running 6.5.2 which is showing all nodes in the cluster.
the expected behavior is for the meno with options to not disappear, so user can add a `control`.
visualization is filtered by the selected value
the input and output should still appear, and filters should have information `n/a`.
you should be able to add the filter.
need to add into the group
apart from clearing session information on logout, there should be a way to invalidate cookies, maybe by using a server side cache of sessions which can be used to verify a cookie.
these cookies or session cache data should get deleted on logout.
load all index pattern titles, not mappings, loading the mappings up front when we load the mappings for the selected index later on seems pretty odd.
performance wise it's super expensive and makes kibana pretty unusable at times.
ideally, unquoted strings would be highlighted in red like the quoted strings.
you should have suricata row renderers and not netflow renderers
1. suggestions and template population should happen while modifying agg_type and not name
i want to be able to search for or against null values.
i think kibana should create an
map should render completely (similar to how it looks on screen)
reporting should fail with a `saved object is missing` message.
instead, it fails with a timeout error.
the only helpful message here is a `debug` level message: `server log failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (not found)`
i dont think i fully understand elastic/kibana already and all of its terms, but to my understanding im only using two "single value numeric metric aggregation"s to try to have a dynamic gauge.
so this according to some tutorial page i found should give me a working gauge.
in step 7 above, the upper extent of the y-axis should be `(max value of metric + margin)`
the saved search is loaded.
elastic search shouldn 't hung/ crash
either a filter should be applied, or the regions should not be interactable
all fields which are used in result set should be exported.
that would be the same behavior like the csv export int discovery module.
but the csv export shows some json like output: i expected to find all fields which are used in the csv file.
that rest api is consistent with ui.
sort correctly by using `"numeric_type": "date_nanos"` probably only when the format of the index pattern is switched to *date nanos*.
counter should not be 0
webhook http scheme should be https but it's http work around: directly modify config using api and set scheme to https
would expect the response time of `post api/spaces/space` to be similar to going direct to es, this request took 94ms.
show the document counts per day as in version 5.
as a user, i should be able to access the page whether a second authentication protocol is enabled or not.
it should sort the numbers in an ascending way or descending way
you see the value that metricbeat has send.
ram- value of 325 mbyte, but what you see is a tenth of the value.
in this case 32.5 mbyte.
if you select the "last 8 hours", you will see the right value (325 mbyte).
when we cannot find a related saved object, a useful error should be displayed explaining what happened.
show wms instead of base map.
instead, we should receive a useful error message to aid in debugging the query.
datepicker interval should be updated without getting set to 'off'
it should log to `kibana.log` again and log `reloading logging configuration due to sighup.` because of this test should make sure it 's happening: phofurl not sure why it doesn 't fail.
same behavior for both searches with a meaningful error message, but - category : *ccessories keeps on searching and pops up "error loading data cannot read property 'map ' of null" error dialog - category : ?ccessories displays "no results message" and pops up a "lucene syntax warning" error dialog behavior should be similar and error dialog message should be more meaningful.
above function was working on version 7.1
should be able to create or edit a space with a custom color.
that same link should load centered on aug 13, with the included trace id in the query filter bar
if there is no index pattern, the filter dropdowns can probably not get populated correctly.
maybe show the filter pill in a corrupted state?
in the first error case we could "side-load" the correct index pattern as it 's still there, in second case filter pill could also get cleaned up when removing index pattern.
it 'd be nice if there was a warning or alert that the user can 't access this setting.
should show all fields from all enabled filebeat modules.
1. since we're in `verbose` logging mode and seeing debug-level messages, we should be seeing a lot more logs.
example of the browser console running the same page as the dashboard in the above report: image phofimage 2. the headless browser is attributing `_type` fields to each of its own logging events.
we should use those to map level of each headless-generated log to our own logging, so error logs show up with `error` tag in our logs.
user sees only `es2` nodes in the list.
user is redirected back to the cluster listing page.
the role should accept the cluster privilege (like so many of the reserved roles define themselves, such as `logstash_system` where i copied the privilege above for this example).
the csv should have the same rows that the dashboard has.
changes should be reflected status_of_index phofimage import_advance phofimage
default index should persist during browser sessions
items are vertically aligned and probably left-justified as well.
the expected behavior is as shown on the page at phofurl
filters are staying on their places
kibana should load in ie11
the mixed-index pattern (which matches 1 rollup index + all the live indices) should correctly report data from both the rolled up and live data, instead it will only fetch data from the live view
when adding a second filter it should stay in position, the filter should be applied.
the result shoud be shown and the period should not start advancing by itself.
this is a gap in the original design of reporting.
we track `kibana_id` in each reporting job, and this can be used to solve the problem.
if a kibana instance is idle and polling finds a job owned by that instance, still in processing, then it needs to re-claim the job, adding 1 to the `attempts` field
i expected the display to automatically zoom in on the selected period (as did 7.2.x) i could not find any evidence that this was a deliberate change so i assume this is a regression.
i expect that scenario to work (detailed page to completely load), because your document actually suggest using url as monitor.id here: phofurl it gives example of " phofurl
user should be prompted to save data before being allowed to go to the
should not display error/warning messages when firing alerts that have recently been deleted.
or at least should be fairly rare, and not scary (warning not error), in case it 's difficult to precisely nail this down.
sort should sort the entries taking in the number and time span (days, hours, mins, etc) into consideration.
logstash indices are only queried on the overview page, or in the logstash-related metric pagess.
index pattern should be detected by app.
url should be `/kibana/app/infra`, or ` phofurl
proper working delete saved objects function
i 'm trying to use kql!
;p is it possible that kibana doesn 't treat `-` (dash) as part of a term?
this also happens when i 'm searching for a specific field with hostname values that have dashes, such as:
if i click on a term in the chart legend, only one set of values (line) should be displayed, not two.
in this scenario, i 'm not sure whether i 'd expect to go to the main infrastructure page, or back to the last page i was on in the infrastructure area.
i 'd probably expect the former, but latter is what happens.
i guess that depends on convention used on other pages, so that 's not a bug unless you think it is .
but i didn 't expect it to say "logs"!
correct line visualization as in kibana 7.1.1
the pinned filter will re-appear when re-opening the visualization, as it does in discover and dashboard
i'd except to see the selected option added to the search box.
the search box just contains the original `ho`.
i'd except to see the six node names from the first screenshot, at least.
there are just nine values listed, all start with `filebeat`, but none of them are the three i'm looking for.
at step 5., the selected element appears on the workpad page.
the timestamp should match what is displayed in the saved object at the kibana web interface.
apm screen displayed, without error.
import will be done successfully.
it should navigate but doesn't
container starts with an array of elasticsearch_hosts
some count should be shown
using console to create the watch works fine.
expecting to see related data
include `doc_values` in the list of autocomplete items
should move on to the `:` value choices
not changing anything shouldn 't refresh/requery
filter should stay disabled meta state should be preserved.
that the button stays unchecked, and the label disappear
no error, and relevant data displayed :)
if optimization is needed, i highly doubt every plugin requires it.
i suppose that i expect that optimization would not take 28+ hours to complete.
auto-complete suggestions come up and show the 4 options: - _update - _update_by_query - _upgrade - _rollup_search
you should be able to clearly see all the menu options for that item (typically things like
the infrastructure icon in the nav pane should still be highlighted.
both watches should work as they have before.
i expected either that the ui would indicate sooner that a reindex of a closed index was not possible, or else that the reindex process would open the index beforehand and close it afterwards.
my proposal: - restrict disabling the last enadled metric (if `schema.min === 1`); - if there are two metrics - first `enabled` and the second `disabled` - after removing the `enabled` one, the `disabled` should become enabled automatically; applying these changes will avoid request errors.
being able to log in
reports should contain the timespan they were generated for.
png reports should match pdf reports.
png reports should match pdf reports.
report generation should wait until all the data is loaded
the png should not contain any tooltips.
markdown editor and table should be rendered and appear on dom
both cases must display results.
reporting job should fail and message should say "saved object not found."
i should see the highest-count domains in the entire index pattern as the largest slices of the pie chart.
* kibana should be fast to load.
* navigating between kibana panels/apps should not cause a long reload of resources
the ui will only send one very expensive request and await a server response before sending another.
is listed one, but it 's listed many times
must show all the documents or agent.hosts included in the criteria match.
elasticsearch should exist regardless of kibana activity
in previous versions the full field name and its value were displayed.
i confirmed it worked this way in 6.2.4, i do not know which version between 6.2.4 and 6.8.1 changed the behavior.
should not see `error browser[severe]` messages
you should be able to scroll down to see all available fields.
should get back "<value>"}`, instead getting `{"sample_rate": "<value>"}`
i can install the generated plugin.
kibana has been successfully started.
kibana dev server with plugin is launched and accessible in browser
kibana dev server launched and accessible in browser
users should be able to clone the `pitch` template.
able to view visual builder report elements.
kibana should show always 5% - if it was last 1 year, 5 years, last 24 hours.
5. i think that changing interval in "panel options" matters.
aggregation syntax should be auto-completed correctly (as in 7.1.0 and previous)
the headlines should be within the panels.
text in tables should be left aligned.
numbers should be right aligned.
this ensures good readability and makes it easier to compare numbers.
the expandable rows should look and behave like state in the eui documentation (also the panel version for smaller screens)
urls should use ellipses in the middle to ensure the beginning and end are readable.
private settings of index should be excluded when creating new index with format 7.0.
the tooltip would contain the correctly formatted text, in this case a hyperlink like: link phofhyperlink
tooltip would expand to fit the width of the content and the "add to filter" buttons
the transform list should still load.
i'd expect the list to somewhere (audit messages for example) to report the issue of the delete source index.
- the link should take the back to cloud.
preferably the apm page: ` phofurl - the sentence should also be updated to: `to enable the apm server go to the elastic cloud console and enable apm in deployment settings.
once enabled, refresh this page.` this will help avoid confusion for those people that doesn't know what ess means.
you can create visualize dashboard 1. sample index phofcode <img width="341" alt=" 4 50 06" src=" phofurl no errors occur if there is no rank-feature data type
when i click the add button, it shows the list of existing visualisation
it shows a nice layout like in other dominant browsers.
tile maps are properly shown.
get a message: fatal error: [elasticsearch.hosts]: definition for this key is missing
for a static dataset, in a static interval, each percentile should be the same
an error message indicating that no log rate can be displayed.
aggregation response as shown in 3 should be on visualize.
if the various parms had been valid, should send an email
the timestamps on the x-axis should change to be in the new time zone.
400 response, with as an informative error message as possible
modal should close and no error should occur.
if the `server.cors` settings are configurable in kibana, they should be part of the documentation
there shouldn't be a scrollbar if it's not necessary.
since `disabledfeatures` is optinal, space is supposed to work as designed even if the field is not there.
new log entries appear in the scroll pane that are almost exactly around the time you clicked on.
the minimap and timestamp in the toolbar should not jump around wildly
graph is shown with data.
metrics should show up and updating log indices settings should have no impact on container metrict detail page.
either of the following would be acceptable: 1. integrate the creation of at least one index pattern into the workflow of creating a new space, or 2. when creating or modifying a space with no index patterns, enforce that the index pattern management feature is enabled, or 3. when a user attempts to access index pattern management feature, but does not have access to that feature (due to space restrictions, role permissions, or otherwise), simply display a helpful error instead of exploding spectacularly.
correct label shown for field
add data tutorial reflects all the necessary steps
remove action to create an ml job if ml is disabled in the current space / don't display links to existing ml jobs.
page loads and ml integration is grayed out or removed
column name is "id" but it contains the "name" values
expect link to contain the kibana endpoint, as it does when you are not in a space.
the tutorial steps should work with the current version of functionbeat.
kibana should have loaded the x-pack plugin
'by' combobox should allow us select fields related to the default index pattern.
you log in successfully and see the
iso-functionality across the 2 version.
i don 't know what was trying to be displayed per se, but the term indices would make sense in the context of my screenshot
i was expecting a filter "tosearchon is one of foo, bar, baz" to be added.
and as a result that the first 2 documents would remain
the `rows` and `columns` button should show the state that is currently selected.
documents are listed and can be viewed.
enabling move to warm phase on rollover should modify the policy.
`_source` column should be formatted the same in the dashboard as it is in discover
index pattern adds with no issue, as it did on the test instance.
the link loads tsvb as expected.
in 6.5 we can set custom label correctly: image phofimage
i would expect the value to be "2019" in the discover tab too.
kibana should load (and should show "your browser doesn 't meet kibana security requirements" message).
short urls should open correctly regardless of the underlying query.
kibana finds the `ldapjs-client` module in the plugin dependencies and loads it
tooltip text should be light on the dark background.
expected the tooltip value for "value1" to display the full value to the right of the "value1" label
the dashboard should filter on the clicked item
data frame list should show all transforms
the form should be invalid, a warning message should be displayed.
only settings coming from installed plugins shall be presented on the advanced setting page.
seems that the current implementation merge together plugin settings + override settings without checking if an overridden setting exist or not.
cc @elastic/kibana-platform that is a behavior in between app team and platform team.
do you know if there was a historical reason to allow behavior or is just simply a wrong implementation?
refresh button should fetch newly added services but not show an empty page
the document would render with the correct, original value of
maps wms layer works with the same settings as coordinate map visualization.
there is a checkbox (in `6.7.0`) / switch (in `7.2.0`), which should be always `checked` and `disabled`, since the value of `min_doc_count` is always set to `0` (due to elastic docs) -> docs phofimage
expected is this chrome screenshot; image phofimage
if the grouped view shows no data with an unrelated filter, neither should the ungrouped view.
the tsvb visualization shows the same chart data as the metrics explorer.
the charts are arranged in three columns with a scrollbar to reach the "load more" button at the bottom.
the tab bar at the top remains intact.
the index patterns should be passed as an array in the data frame config that's sent to es apis, instead of passing the comma-separated list.
that message should display only if the number of visualizations is greater than the listinglimit setting.
the marked log entry is centered in the stream
temporary files from reports are supposed to be deleted after report is complete
stack monitoring app icon is not supposed to be present as it's not an included feature.
the bar for "abc" should show.
note that selecting "def" does display properly.
it seems as if the filter doesn 't properly handle mixed cases or all caps, only lower-case values.
the user should be redirected to the detail page.
always use the first number for the color rules
up to 1000 viz are paginated
the ui should respond after it deletes the saved objects (within a couple of seconds)
should filter on the name
docs should be updated to indicate latest minor version in 6.x series is 6.8
should always populate columns for new documents

* ', label="inbound $1"), screen shot at 5 41 08 pm phofimage basically, i 'm trying to compensate for windows 32bit counter resetting after 4 gigs, so that can more accurately track bandwidth utilization on those hosts, but currently i 'm just doing an if(lt,0,0) to zero out any negative numbers that are produced by derivative.
i 'd rather do some math on that field instead to try and come up with something more accurate, but whole things seems to break down whenever use a split separate out unique network interfaces.
this looks like broken functionality me, but honestly can 't be certain i 'm not just doing something wrong.
what had hoped for was a way re-use original series in "then" clause of my if statement without having re-iterate entire original series again, don 't see a way do that (not even in source code so far.)
i 'm not sure what the intended behavior is when cloning a repo that primarily consists of source code in a language for which a language server isn 't available/installed in kibana.
the tooltip box expands to fit the data to a certain point and then if it still is exceeded then a scroll bar appears
the colour stays the same cc: @aaronjcaldwell
ui lets you save your edits without deleting the spaces.
after all, they were a part of your original index, so why would you need to edit them just to edit another attribute of the data frames creation process.
(please see screenshot) <img width="703" alt="screen shot at 2 37 52 pm" src=" phofurl
the page will not show integration links for disabled apps
arabic letter expected to be from right to left attached, not separated letters from left to right
i think path need to be corrected, kibana 7.1 built asset available under so the same need to corrected in browser resolved path to display image.. background:
`data-title` is set to proper value, e.g.
at the very least, the sidebar control should parse the filter group out of its expression `filtergroup` argument.
ideally, we would iterate * all * the elements and check for groups there as well.
that requires some ast parsing though, and would only work on pre-defined functions.
it would be a slightly better experience, but it may not actually be worth doing.
a 200 response with the expected content is returned.
the page should correctly display the job in "stopping" status
the layers select box should be set to the configured layer (road_map by default)
it should filter on the term value clicked on.
we need to add an automated test for this.
filter by both the filter query and group b
only the "aggregation" would change, leaving the field.
this makes it easier to switch from, say, "max" to "avg" to "median" to decide which works best.
the timelion legend shows the value from actual via mouse hover selected interval for non auto interval lines graph as step.
new platform should be library agnostic.
the page title should read "inventory" instead of "snapshot"
as the `elasticsearch.url` and settings are only marked as deprecated (but not yet removed) and neither setting is mentioned as a breaking change, both settings should still work in 6.7.2.
after sso kibana returns the user to the original url
histogram with interval 0.5 is displayed.
this worked in 6.7 and earlier.
not to kill my bandwidth once a minute.
the query matches 285 documents.
the visualization should show 285 as the count, but it shows 111.
the default index pattern should use the default time field specified on that patter (that is correctly picked up by the `api/metrics/field` call but not used on the `/data` call.
should be able to see the monitor screen
after opening the saved visualization - the
the server should be restarted to apply new changes
cluster alerts should be read only (no editing).
it's best if we can add owner column that would indicated system vs. user watches
not crashing any idears why its still used?
we are using kibana 7.0.1 within docker and upgraded our es cluster just recently from 6.7 to 7.0 the output is from docker compos

only display the objects "analysis "dashboard as the result
the "delete" & "export" buttons are not greyed out and the objects are still selecte
a role with permissions to everything, similar to `superuser` should be able to generate reports in kibana, and should not require user-intervention to manually set the for every role that needs reporting.
kibana to not become hung when restarting post reboot.
all of the matched monitors are displayed.
the close button should always be visible to close the detail panel and perhaps a scroll mechanism should be provided to view long detail text.
the ui should show the correct (new) module name, apache.
sorting is in the a-z order.
in chrome it is z-a.
based on phofurl chrome is incorrect.
pop-up is not cut off and aligned with the edge of the view.
new tab is opened with appropriate viz been displayed
the tooltip doesn 't extend off the screen and is completely visible
the `n/a`s should not be there.
instead actual, accurate values should be shown.
the name of the * type * of the field should pop up instead.
the navbar should be correctly updated according to the currently active route.
i suspect this line of code is not executed for plugins: phofurl
* if the snapshot view shows data, so should the node detail view * if for some reason the privileges are not sufficient, both the snapshot view and node detail view should show a message saying so, and not a graphql error
kibana 7.0.0 and higher should render the hyperlink properly as previous versions of kibana did.
index pattern is created and able to be used in kibana.
shows metric visualizations or reasons why it's not showing.
the current message is unhelpful.
be able to select any item from the aggregation list
expect a tile map to be displayed when loading coordinate/region visualization types.
two values should be the same
the points should display, with tooltips.
the points display if i break them down into separate documents.
expected the "events ingested" column to be non-zero.
should be possible to set zero - should not fail with uncaught type error.
kibana ui should open up.
shrink index should be persisted when you save
no join error to occur unless there is a data mismatch
clearing the "left field" value should have no impact on specified values for "right field"
no borders to be drawn when border width is set to 0
pages to load without outputting warnings / security errors
all plugins have a correct version number
a negated filter needs to have a visual clue (like the red color in kibana < 7.0.0).
otherwise no one can distinguish on a custom labeled filter if it currently includes or excludes the results
if we have a band mode, i 'm expecting to see 2 values on the legend: one for the higher percentile, and one for the lower percentile.
fields do not step outside the boundary.
the form should be populated with the available fields without throwing an error.
i can connect the kibana docker image with an elastich search node using ingress without specifying ports
should be able to see all the servers.
1. dashboard should reflect data in new timezone
the visualization does not fail
should not show cpu and memory charts in the metrics page.
for the stats chard to still work and not have a console error
the logic either needs to ignore disabled filters and apply a new one, or ensure the updated filters are enabled.
exclude filter should highlight in red background color.
groupings should stay below the map view/table view buttons
configuration is accepted without error.
(note, i have not ever had this working, so i can 't say exactly what i 'd expect.
it 's certainly possible i 'm doing something wrong, but i 'm not finding anything)
usage-data queries should not return large objects like assets.
default elastic map and shape are displayed.
from most ideal to least ideal but still ok outcomes: - normal grouping - preservation of the ad-hoc group - ad-hoc group selection is gone but the elements stay where they were im all versions, the resulting elements / groups remain subject of selection, drag&drop, hover box
hide the field throughout kibana
pdf reporting file should be generated with correct non-english texts, whenever canvas workpad title is non-english.
visualizations with top oriented legends should be horizontally oriented both in the editor and dashboard.
this issue made all of our 30+ dashboards unusable, and we had to do an immediate rollback to 6.7
messaging/ui elements for the basic license state would be shown, as they are with a fresh install of the stack.
saved search detail should respect dark theme as it did in previous versions of kibana.
index pattern should be created and should be able to view index in discover tab or see fields in index patterns
it should describe events as `[system][auth] sudo` for example
for step 5, no results should be found.
the cached data should have been updated when the filter was added.
on refresh - anomalies table should have same results as before the refresh
the graph in the threshold watch should have a similar event count as seen in discover.
you can see from the images below, each using logstash* as the index pattern (this was the only logstash feed going into cluster) that discover app shows on average documents per 5 second bucket while graph in threshold watcher ui shows around 70,000 documents per 5 second bucket.
i think the focus should go to the first "actionable" element on the selected tab, as it currently works if we have an absolute date selected.
there should be some content
if an index is replaced that happens to be your default index, then the id of the default index should be updated so it points to the replacement index pattern.
while the error screen is good for initial kibana usage it strongly implies that problem is a missing index pattern, when in fact actual error is that it can no longer find it's default pattern and needs you to pick a new one.
this needs to be made clearer on panel.
export a csv sorted by parameters on each cell
workpad should be scaled up to fill window, maintaining aspect ratio
a table is build showing offsets appropriately based upon the number of elements added
items in the visualization legend are arranged in a row, not a column.
i would expect the wmsclient to recognize the query parameters in the user-supplied url as an object and extend that object with the additional parameters.
so `getmap` url gets constructed like ` phofurl
`handlers.getfilter()` should return the value of the current `filter` property
kibana should wait at least milliseconds for a long-running query.
can reference which visualizations are used in a given dashboard
it would be useful not to change the tab, or even refresh the data in the inspector while the tab is open.
if you're investigating a discrepancy in request and page refreshes while you're looking at it it could be pretty annoying for user.
the server will log errors like: phofcode
step 1. should have failed.
ideally more room on page could be given to the pattern name.
as a short term fix, perhaps some hover text would make it easier to identify.
kibana should remain running even if it cannot access its own data on es and show a similar prompt on browser.
if a manifest file does not exist in a particular folder, then the recognizer should move on to the next folder.
imo this is not worth even logging.
more broadly, if an ml module fails to load then this should not stop all other modules from loading.
for example a missing visualization file may stop module_a from loading but it should not stop module_b and module_c from loading.
this would be worth logging imo.
the search will be applied to select fields in our hb index.
there should be an accurate reflection of the current values displayed by the chart.
the updated element should have a matching filter valu
a sample relevant to the search criteria should be shown
they should all say "labels"
the tooltip background/container should be the same width as the tooltip text
2. displayed date of `to` should read `70 years ago` years ago phofimage
same as ccr or rollups
warning you don't have permissions like in ccr and rollups image phofimage
should show the count as "0"
in previous versions of kibana (up to and including 6.5.4), when i hover over a value in the legend, i can then click anywhere in the dark grey area to then show the magnifiers (meaning i * don't * have to click directly on the value itself).
accessing other restricted areas results in a permissions error.
for example, accessing watcher: phofcode
dotsize should change issues: 1.when change the "dot size ratio" slider the "apply change" button not enabled.
2.when change the "dot size ratio" slider the dot size not changing in visual.
+/- buttons to filter values
should be linked to current, available manual page about the issue.
the panel would maximize and contain data from the same span of time as when the maximize button was clicked.
that it loads, regardless of cluster size.
expecting the save button to actually save the watch, but it doesn't respond.
should see a toggle ui element with label
a policy should allow removal of `set_priority` action
there are shards and their allocation to individual nodes on index details page.
node overview page contains proper node name.
1. no issue loading kibana
the url should only update once and not duplicate the hash + search string in an encoded copy at the end of the url.
in my opinion, kibana ui should produce similar error like in elasticsearch logs.
the transaction details should show up like it does with any other transaction not ending in a `/`
the messages from the delayed response should be added to the logs ui
in my opinion this tooltip box should be allowed to size to data.
should remove the tags from the list.
i know that we probably use data from the remote clusters for ccr monitoring stats, but if there is no ccr configured, we should skip the check for the remote clusters since we don 't display any data about it in the monitoring page (so it 's basically of no use).
@timroes @alonanadler what is the expected behavior?
: 1) we can process it as wrong input and use the
kibana keep waiting until the 503 stops.
the default search in discovery view shouldn 't be this slow and affect whole elasticsearch cluster performance.
there should be a way to customize the default search query to avoid building `date_histogram`.
expecting for kibana to accept array of es hosts
icons should be visible on navbar
the x-axis correctly reflects the year bucket it's associated with.
the button should either work as expected, or at least show an error message with a description of what to do
visualization loads into a fresh 7.0 install
given that in the stats api, the primary size of the index is bytes.
i am expecting one of two things (the text in bold represents the change): * kibana displays
we should set a minimum width/height of 1 to prevent elements from disappearing
load the app without freezing the tab like with chrome 71. the issue does not reproduce with chrome 71 with the same parameters.
boolean value is displayed in the input
a line chart equals bucket size, sibling pipeline aggregation shows correct results.
last 24 hours or last 7 days, the interval of the line chart changes to e.g.
30 minutes or 3 hours.
the result for these intervals of the time series should be maximum value of the original 5 minute buckets within broader 30 minutes or 3 hours buckets.
no automatic scaling should kick in because this leads to incorrect values due to summing (aggregating) over incorrect time intervals.
instead presenting incorrectly aggegreated time series (given that interval is set to a fixed value), wouldn't it be an option not show time series once too many buckets are created?
keep in mind that within a dashboard a user does not get any warnings.
furthermore, raised warning could include hint increase `max_buckets` setting (in case this really works).
i would expect only one layer to appear, not new layers on every keypress.
two graphs overlaid, one representing current data, one representing data from 24 hours ago
data should be present and everything should work as expected
the saved visualization should be searchable using co or co2
the drop down should show the applicable index for you to select and filter appropriately
should show the enrollment option with token generation.
<img width="1661" alt="screen shot at 10 09 10 pm" src=" phofurl
the whole timepicker nicely displayed, not partially hidden.
still, i shouldn 't have to do that.
ideally i should be able to do this: `(doc[ 'units '].value / 75000)`
when you change pages, none of the elements should remain selected.
button and text should not be the same color as the alert background.
it should display the correct `ms`.
all the maps shouldn't go full screen
kibana able to connect to elasticsearch via elasticsearch.hosts string.
icmp will be a filter option
should not crash and should treat this the same as cloud not being enabled.
no `warning` message will be displayed
the filter popup should stay open and allow the filters to be applied.
a tool tip will appear if data is available, nothing if not.
clearing the "number of replicas" box resets the ilm policy to ensure the ilm policy doesn 't change the number of replicas
the button text should be truncated as without a rollup index
it should see that the crlf is within a quote-escaped field and not assume that it 's a new record.
see the logs from my indexes on the logs ui
the warning message should not appear.
i believe the problem lies in the fact that the `.management-beats` template is being created with a mapping that specifies the type name `_doc` without adding `include_type_name` in request, which es 7 doesn 't allow anymore phofhyperlink
the warning message should not appear since both versions are in sync.
the same thing will display as what's shown today, but without the 0.
no query bar needs to be shown on editor in tsvb.
it needs to reflect the options configured in phofurl
the filter should update after the scripted field is edited.
a paliative would be including a message on the edit scripted field interface saying that filters based on the scripted field will not update and will need to be recreated
expect the items to nest underneath the first row of items, as it's showing when you toggle the filters button.
top 5 values are displayed.
should show data on a map
<img width="1440" alt="screen shot at 10 59 27 am" src=" phofurl
legend contains a human-friendly value, such as `no data available`.
all icons on the kibana left navbar must be visible after i click on my plugin icon.
not 100% sure what the expected behavior is, it should probably apply filter for all the values that are in the legend.
have a scroll so you can see all fields
it should be clear to the person looking at the upgrade assistant ui that those critical notices are referring to a required reindex before upgrading to elasticsearch 8.0 and not a problem with their current stack.
one suggestion is if kibana 6.7 detects the nodes are (all, or at least one?)
at 7.0 then show a congratulations message.
once kibana is also at 7.0, then it would show these critical messages (but again, should that say `8.0 upgrade assistant`?
no error would be produced.
as many structured data outputs as there are lines in sample data.
i'm not sure how we should deal with the data where the count > 1 like shown in the example above.
one choice is to only report those fields for one of the instances of kibana.
you would think they would tend to be same, although i've seen a couple cases where they weren't.
another choice is to write a separate doc for each instance, but that probably has much larger consequences.
maybe we could come up with a scripted field to use.
should be rendered as an overlay (position: absolute and background color).
index pattern should be created and should be able to view index in discover tab or see fields in index patterns
before reindexing the ml indices that might be written to by running ml jobs the migration assistant needs to pause ml jobs even if the indices have been previously reindexed.
no action should be triggered.
it should show all 19 fields for the time-period "jan 1 2019 to jan 3 2019
the code should load without issue.
when something is obviously misconfigured, say something other than everything looks ok and i'm probably all set.
grids should be properly aligned irrespective of aggregation
task manager should mark the task as failed, remove the task instance, but ultimately stop re-trying
a display of the shards, their location and state should be shown.
see difference between 6.2.4 and 6.6.0 screenshots below.
kibana 6.7.0 needs to be compatible with elasticsearch 7.0.0 as that 's the order we tell customers to upgrade.
the edit ui should show up.
the attribution text should be just "test2
kibana main page should appear
x-axis should be limited by whathever was stipulated on the timepicker.
labels should all show up if "filter labels" is not selected.
labels should not repeat if there is a small number of buckets.
additionally, if the chart style is bar, it would make more visual sense if the time label is centered on the bucket instead of coming before bucket.
the docs should specify a number (0?)
this should either render out as an actual link (use some sort markdown parser, or just an actual html link
expect a csv report with the chosen date format
the switcher should be covered by the suggestion popup where they overlap
the select boxes for "vector maps" and "layer" should remain as default to "world countries" and "road_map" respectively.
rendered data should be scrolled or improved usability
the creation of the ml jobs should be successful for every transaction type
truncation, but not _total_ truncation.
if you set the field length to "1", you get truncation (more than one character though - it truncates the string to "/identfiers...").
i have no idea what quantity the numbers represent (clearly not string length in terms of character count).
master nodes must be visible also.
kubernetes metrics must show correct numbers
swimlanes should load and be visible and populated
create index pattern view should be opened.
instead of that i was navigated to the home page.
similar to the bar version of the graph: image phofimage image phofimage
in order to ensure that i am not accidentally deleting the wrong objects, the friendly human-readable object name could also be displayed, if known.
`plugin-helpers` should be available either under the global node executable path or the local node_modules bin path.
dsl should reveal a `match_phrase` query
visualizations still work and are in the selected timezone.
either gracefully ignore the keys or throw a warning stating the key is deprecated with a recommended key
the shapes should look identical across browsers.
would be nice if it worked consistently on ie11.
filter should remain when undoing/redoing actions unrelated to the time filte
workpads should only be saved when changes are made, not when they are loaded.
this is not best practice because user may restore the original group by using: `rpm --setugids kibana` i expect that the files section of the spec file contains: %dir %attr(0775, kibana, kibana) /var/lib/kibana %dir %attr(0775, kibana, kibana) %attr(0644, root, root)
asking for username/ password in kibana ui.
there should be nginx metrics for hosts that have nginx data.
the kibana server applies the deprecation transformations, prints deprecation warnings on stdout or stderr and proceeds to startup process.
should see a toast message suggesting to use default distribution build instead of oss build to get more zoom levels.
expected behavior is that the follower index should be created.
at the very least kibana needs to inform the user that something is wrong.
currently there is absolutely no indication that there is even a problem.
in order to fix this you have to go to dev tools in the 6.5.4 cluster and do something like: phofcode
the system should give more information to the user
if toggle 'ing this "store (primaries)" on, there should be only blue line left on that graph.
the error message returned would be something like: phofcode
honor the filters set on a per visualization basis as well as the context of the dashboard
the layer panel should scroll to see items off-screen.
this could be an issue with eui.
this is only an issue with firefox.
scrolling works fine in chrome and safari.
all log entries would be rendered in the year in which they occurred.
screen shot at 11 40 55 am phofimage
showing the follower index with error
short url works well except for default space
page should work as expected
- when falling back to polling it shouldn 't keep trying to make a websocket connection - it should detect that there was a problem and not just keep showing image phofimage
this should give you an error response because a payload is required.
instead, it gives you a 200 response with an ok message.
should create a `chrome_debug.log` file with non-fatal logs, and exit.
i think it would be preferable if the index management page didn 't show indices that the user didn 't have access to.
and then kibana should also not try to get the docs count and storage size for those indices.
and then the errors wouldn 't appear.
these errors don 't prevent user from managing indices that they do have full privs on note that this user can run `get _cat/indices` so they can already see which indices exist.
so from that perspective, index mgmt ui doesn 't leak any new information.
so it 's really just errors are an issue.
only request data when the user asks for new data.
a common thing to do was to show the labels for the display.
it used to make sense before 6.x versions because it would show you what you are currently looking at.
but now it requests new data potentially changing our display and the user wondering how did i start with 3 pie slices and end up with 5 just by showing labels.
related to: #18668, #27440, #2747
- the data recogniser for nginx module should work and allow creation of new nginx module ml jobs.
- the apache2 data recogniser ought to fail silently and should not exist as an option for new job creation in the ui.
"ignore condition (condition is always true)" label is displayed
read and write access to other spaces should be blocked for my user
a simple timeseries visualization will be displayed
best case scenario would be translate the placeholder when applying the policy, but another temporary option would be to warn that it doesn't work when setting a placeholder-like alias.
the conversion should throw if `isnan(number(value))` is true.
bump any viz after the first down below the first one to maintain use of the width of the panel.
service files should live in `/lib/systemd/system` files that go in `/etc/systemd/system` should be placed by an admin manually (e.g.
to override a package or because a package doesn't provide one).
i may provide a pr for this.
i hit it while trying to decide which files i needed to manually migrate when migrating an instal
i would expect the icon to change to "ok" quickly after execution.
no crash, just cancel the action.
the color picker should appear just above or below the color square button depending on how much space is available.
should be possible to navigate to metrics ui
expect import to find `react` from kibana/node_modules
any inflight requests shouldn't be retried as it can overload elasticsearch, especially if there are timeouts happening.
it should get properly build using yarn bootstrap
pod names should be visible
rendering table cells in a compact way to display data on smaller screens.
user b should not be able to see commands from user a

optimize should only run once initially
i 'd expect the filtered number of objects to be imported
no console error and the hovered item visually highlighted.
load the dashboard in iframe
a user with kibana_user role who could create an index pattern in 6.5 should also be able to create an index pattern in 6.6 without adding additional privileges.
i expect the empty buckets to be kept, as the fact they have no entries is useful information.
a second bucket should be shown.
rendercomplete would fire once when all table rows had completed rendering
create button and list should display.
the create button should not offer rollup option due to expired license.
that that performance is brought back down to the same expected behavior as in 5.6.1
trim the log y-axis to start at the specified min.
the generated report should include the custom logo created in step 1 above, instead of the default pdf logo.
kibana should show the results.
if i copy the curl command in kibana and run it in a terminal, the command runs fine.
phofcode if i add `> /tmp/results.txt`: phofcode so the results are only 180m.
the top summary stats bar should display in a single line, and be properly formatted/styled.
i expect kibana to ignore the client 's authorization header, and use the authorization header i specified with when communicating to elasticsearch.
this works in at least 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 for me.
no fatal error when navigating in the dashboard.
- data matching the chosen period is displayed in data table
i would like to see `stop job` so that i can then later delete i
kibana should deduplicate the same underlying aggregation and only run them once.
results should update when a subset of time range is selected
should see all the pages, and be able to re-order them via drag and drop.
looks like some css change might have broken it.
agent check should not pass until an agent reports in.
the server check should still pass.
expected redirect to baseprefix + `/api/status` or just return the status directly phofcode i believe this happened before and was fixed, perhaps not backported to 6.x.
this manifests in broken dashboard loading for apm-server, among other issues
kibana upgrades and starts normally.
there should be an auto interval and auto should be the default
learn some cool stuff about tinymath
what's visible must be selectable for the grouping
the blank legend entry and bars related to blank values should be highlighted
we should be able to use any field for the chart
the postinstall of the package should trigger the systemctl daemon-reload
auto-refresh should disable when i point and drag a graph a graph to "zoom".
the transparent dragged aggregation should be positioned under the cursor.
the error symbol either should not be clickable or have a meaningful function (maybe scrolling to the error would be cool)
-expected behavior is that when a given object is selected on the save objects screen that it and it alone would be selected.
however, in this case, both objects will be selected.
the visualization should be shown
should lead to a correct documentation page
the filter should behave as expected and match records with the specified field contents.
filebeat should report "sent bytes" even when using kafka output.
should only show currently running pods.
kibana should keep the space information in the url after login or opening a permalink.
a warning should be shown when the time interval is being scaled
have the split gauge chart completely into both generated pdf reports.
it should probably refer to: phofurl
as they are not the same containers i expect that they are displayed two times with another host they run, and i expect different detail metric inforamtion
it works well when i install canvas through plugin.
the loading speed is about 5 seconds.
here's what it looks like in safari 11 phofimage
it should show the items that do exist.
it certanly shouldn 't hide all all screen components.
resets back to the default that it says (
an imported dashboard including saved objects
i expected to see the ccr stats for the second cluster in monitoring ui in kibana.
from 6.4.0: screen shot at 2 04 45 pm phofimage
kibana should create a new indices .kibana_1 and .kibana_2 as working space to perform migration actions and a .kibana alias pointing to the completed migrated index.
users will not see spaces, they don't have permissions for image phofimage ### what user see after login: image phofimage
the docs with empty value in ``host`` should be searched out.
1. x-axis ordering of bars should be consistent with or without "split series" bucket.
2. x-axis ordering of bars should be consistent no matter how many records are retrieved or how they are bucketed.
i expect that privilege to appear in the drop-down list.
transaction name should be "get /"
i expect those privileges to appear in the drop-down list.
console to pretty print the search command regardless of data being returned

either a tooltip or being able to see the entire field namne on the first place
no changes in the style of the dashboard when switching to a different app.
section should render on page loa
reporting option should be available on dashboard tab so we can set up automatic report generation from dashboards
add validation when user inputs the name
min values and max values needs to be configured with the same rounding of the input range.
the `/login` should always display login page.
it loads the appropriate kibana screen for the url i shortened
it 's not broken currently, it could just be clearer.
when a workpad is loading, you see a loading icon in the upper left corner and small clock icons are place on each loading element.
as part of a larger discussion around performance, we discussed improving the loading experience so that users are more aware when things are still loading (status) and how much remains (progress).
switching to phofcode instead of phofcode would make it ?
i would expect it to just put the json string into that cell
dots should be the same color as the line
let index pattern page allow defining an index pattern if remote clusters are defined
the dates shown in the same format they are display in the option list.
the report generates without errors.
kibana needs to drop the user to the page with contents.
it should update the existing markers with the new color.
interval warning should display the actual interval it was scaled to.
two possibilities: - when entering a row template, validate if before showing the tooltips - or enable writing wrong templates but avoid the error displaying a warning message on the tooltip
two possibilities: - when entering a row template, validate if before showing the tooltips - or enable writing wrong templates but avoid the error displaying a warning message on the tooltip
delete and return to management page.
the timelion chart should show the correct data for that period 1. create the simple timelion query ( only count the data) with interval 1w image phofimage 2.
the icon is in the same position, but the background is only enough to contain the icon, not a full-width bar.
i should see a blank page with description like this screenshot from phofimage i see the following error instead phofcode
should work like any other transaction.
we don 't restrict transaction names, so all characters should be escaped.
- load the "test-index*" index pattern and search for "testid:1234"
clicking forward to next match should autoscroll.
request text should come in its own box as it is supposed to
i am able to select percentile aggregation and calculate 90th percentile of "time" as the final displayed value
labels bottom-align to bottom of gauge half-circle bar (see chrome)
i would expect the search to behave the same way, no matter if i add a field name or not.
canvas page is centered and fills the browser window with the constraint of aspect ratio preservation (possible black band on top/bottom or left/right)
"other" is displayed in the list of labels on the y axis
box should be on the left, like this: image phofimage
clicking search button, should always submit a search.
either show the time when it was supposed to expire or don't list the time at all
errors should be shown to the user 1b.
saved objects should be filtered by the selected type
i would expect to be able to select the text of a link.
the functionality works as expected in safari.
in this case, these are all shapes which don't rely on external resources, so an instantaneous load is anticipated.
elements using raw documents datasource list all columns
i would expect to see the output configuration.
instead, i am redirected to the add data page.
the lists should contain options.
as soon as you supply a new search for the new index pattern, it should cancel the previous one, and only provide the result for the new input.
the `&` should be rendered as `&` since we 're using `{{rawvalue}}`
job validation should be able to recognize a nested date field correctly.
we should either wrap the list of fields for that column (up to a number of rows) or just show an indicator that there are more fields than the ones visible (using the suspension points maybe), or making it a collapsible list with an arrow next to it.
it should be sorted either alphabetically or by list index, or any kind of noticeable sorting, to make it easier for the user to navigate the list in case it has a larger number of fields there.
changing the start day of the week should offset the list in the rollup scheduler page.
it should return all dashboards like documented.
the css rule should be applied to the element, as it is valid when the only or last element phofurl
original cloned element remains in its new home
cors should be working too on firefox
the icons should be visible and not rendered as missing links.
i would expect the chart to show some values, even if they are 0s.
similarly the chart 's legend should some values other than n/a.
api/status page should throw 50x
there should be memory growth when auto-refresh is on.
have a way to get inspect/spy feature from discover and visualization views
should be the same color #6d1f62
installation process is completed, plugin installation message is displayed, shell is showing the prompt.
elasticsearch v6.3.2 is downloaded and run.
when selecting a cell with no chartable jobs no charts should show up.
it should be `10.0` as in the response to the curl command: phofcode
i expect that the autocomplete will work when the option is enabled unless there is some other means of enabling the feature.
see the edge screenshot above.
in previous versions when pulling the dashboard you would get associated index-patterns as well.
it seems like this behavior has changed or there was a regression of some kind.
i 'm not entirely sure if this api makes any additional calls to get the `index-patterns` but from what i noticed locally, as well as what 's mentioned in phofurl it appears that the api phofhyperlink has suffered a regression phofcode this seems like a second issue but i wanted to bring it up in case the export dashboards api leverages it or similar logic.
kibana listens on both ipv6 and ipv4 localhost addresses.
all of the executions provide the same chart.
setting to the default 30000 provided consistency across executions
should have current date/time timestamps
6.5 should be backwards compatible with report generation urls from 6.4. users would not be happy if their existing watches that generate pdf reports break on a minor release.
all request blocks collapsed, as they are in 6.3.2
these tests are using `checkuseprintlayout()` so i think that means it should print 2 visualizations per page (title and visualization always together on the same page).
the design (background) should look like this... phofimage
zooming at the location of the data - works in the "visualise" environment where the coordinate map is developed - does not work in "dashboard" where coordinate map is exploited
the default ordering should be alphabetical.
this is especially relevant when mixing and matching dashboards from e.g.
this is a different default from 6.3 where dashboards are listed alphabetically by default.
the shard legend should show all shards of the index, consistent with the output of `_cat/shards`
there should only be a single right-side y-axis (when applicable), and all data series assigned to a seaprate y-axis should use the same y-axis, rather than draw an additional one.
charts should remain as in 6.2.4
filter added to the filter bar
the resetted behavior, as specified in subtitle `default: en` should be `en`
the influencer list shoud dynamically update based on the current view.
detect only files that are really modified.
to be able to recover from errors
table with appropriate data should be shown
only the legend should scroll, not the entire visualization.
either: - do not display closed indices in management and sort only index with a storage size > 0 - sort open indices by storage size and display closed at the end (consider the size is 0 or something)
i would think it should match the numbers shown.
tsvb displays a valid field list in the "field" drop-down menu.
i expect my default index setting to be stored like everything else, but it doesn 't seem to be getting preserved.
see the page which was requested
the `_msearch` query generated by the
kibana starts and binds to all ipv4 and v6 addresses.
we expect that user would be redirected to visualization he had opened before he got logged out due to session timeout.
no error is displayed when adding fields from the "available fields" panel.
make it work the way it did in 6.2.x and earlier.
i would think all visualizations should be consistent and set that attribute true so tests can know when it 's done.
no session timout warning shown
no horizontal scroll bar should be visible
see message "no results found", instead of empty table(visualisation)
incorrect connections in the diagram
table width will change according to screen size or at least according to upper bar
x-axis order should keep the same.
the watch should not be marked as an error in the ui, because the last run was just as expected.
and the entry that seems to be checked seems to be older.
i expect the multi-word items to wrap to 2 lines before the whole section wraps to 2 lines.
data of the last minute
current time marker is pointing at the right time.
- draw a simple scatter plot
maybe ie doesn't support this embedded audio control?
if it's not, we could just change the `bug` label to `notabug` and close it.
i opened this in firefox phofurl and it shows the audio controls.
but it doesn't work in ie 11 on the windows 2012 server vm i'm testing on.
the add and remove buttons should show the full text even if it has to clip the long field names more.
if user clicks on the arrow to collapse all filters - they should be hidden(?)
optimizing and caching browser bundles should succeed
it should open the add panel flyover
user should be able to click `add new visualization`, and then `save and add to dashboard`.
should not have overlapping elements
kibana should validate the step
i'm thinking it probably doesn't need a confirm dialog when i'm upgrading license levels?
page is working image phofimage image phofimage
the discover tab should show the information for the new index pattern.
the time picker should record the recent time ranges
kibana needs to clear the previous selection once you switch the type filter
it should not be possible to focus on elements behind the modal.
visualization for the process in the last 2 hours.
either cancel button needs to be disabled or if user presses on cancel - delete needs to be interrupted.
right now it's not sending the correct message.
kibana should either display - that
would expect it to load normally and show the histogram, rows, and be responsive.
1 email 1 comment but in kibana datatable visualization, i 'm seeing 1 comment to multiple emails.
irrespective of this setting global time filter should work
the apply button should be abled any time the configuration for a visualization is changes
i expect to see the numbers in the second y axis as numbers not percentage
when all kibana plugins are green, i feel it should let me use kibana ;)
the font-size became bigger when i open the kibana with chrome and still the same with firefox.
geo.coordinates recognized and selectable for visualization on map as described in tutorial
region map to properly paint the map while prefecture names are supplied from geolite2 dataset.
both reporting options should report the same coordinate map (including terrain and "points") you find attached here the two different report where it 's clear the issue i 'm reporting in this issue.
thanks for your so precious support, m. ## phofhyperlink phofhyperlink
when i configure the layers with `kibana.yml` as below, it properly works.
the - value should be 0 or disappear, so that i can order the table by this column.
the axis can display normally
the circle markers disappear although we don't need to refresh the web page
the http answer isn 't truncated and the hits are displayed in kibana
the selection should stay in the option list and not be reset, regardless of the size of the option list.
this test should pass unless someone broke the code
nodes should be ordered alphanumerically.
the search bar at the top of the discover page will be absent.
query results matching "leads-api", which are in elasticsearch, show up in kibana discover.
1. on select time dropdown shown full with of fields to be able select appropriate value 2. after select it truncated with some possibility see full (tooltip f.e.)
i would assume all these of these scenarios should result in the same thing.
though ideally, i would be able to install kibana through .deb so i am able to run it as a service.
each document is represented by a single line in the exported csv file.
there should be a search bar across the top of the page, but it's missing.
correct value of metrics and buckets aggregation.
the visualization should contain the result aggregated for all three index patterns, not only for the first two.
be able to only display values on pies independantly from labels
1. complete filter in the following: phofcode 2. result looks like this: phofcode
you should be able to enter the watcher ui to fix the issue, even though it really doesn 't seem to be an issue.
the filters should be pinned.
should this say "not found" instead?
no errors and a new index
i'd expect to be able to sort the last two columns to see the biggest/smallest indices
in the past, it's started up nearly immediately, even with large plugins installed (x-pack and others).
there was no significant delay.
kibana should go green and be usable once elasticsearch is accessible again.
for the request to not include the disabled bucket defs and the proper graphs to show
i would expect to be able to remove the old x-pack plugin using the plugin tool despite having upgraded.
telemetry banner needs to announce whats happening and the resulting action after we click it.
- `test_epochmilli_1` should work like `test_epochmilli_2`
a gauge stay a gauge vis
the rows with lengthy field are properly taken into consideration, and shown with truncated value
a new index pattern should be created.
the headers in the configuration should be sent to elasticsearch.
the original visualization should be overwritten.
details of document should be seen.
"add a filter": a data is listed, "click (+) icon" : no data
server should return a 404 for not found or a 200 response with an empty array.
plugin install should finish quickly
kibana needs to tell the user that he is saving the search with the same name.
kibana should revert back to a basic license without error.
i would expect to be brought to the status page and see a red status for the elasticsearch plugin.
we should either; 1. update the referenced doc to show the standard date format with the `t`.
2. change the link to point to some other doc (like one i mentioned above) which does show `t` 3. remove link and just show an example date string (i added `docs` label in case we do 1)
screenreader should announce the launch of flyout(am using eui term which i see in the console.
kibana should alert the user about action completion
there should be an alert announcing the full screen mode
screenreader needs to announce that user is on create new watch pop-up selection box.
new notifications need to be announced
the input-control should be visually over the same as normal behavior.
rewrite the config in the kibana.yml, and access the kibana dashboard successfully.
we need to either disable add filter or show a message to the user?
they should be better aligned and not break layouts
field names should wrap so layout is preserved.
names should truncate so layouts are not breaking
alert should update according to the new license info
filters should work on visualizations
the filter should be added to the request.
if the port is not specified and `http` schema is on the url, port should be 80 by default, which is the solution i figured out.
the previous `kibana.yml` file works if you modify the `elasticsearch.url` value to: phofcode plus, on verbose mode, kibana should be more specific with log to es.
currently is: phofcode maybe a message kind of `connecting to phofurl ....` could help to catch this kind of errors.
the appstatus should not change, the reporting control should remain active.
it should open the visualization you previously opened and not show any errors.
should remain vertically aligned in the pdf
@spalger believes the problem is that instead of the visualize link using the href to navigate to the long visualization url, it uses `ng-click="onclick({ $event: $event })"` and this has url length limit in ie which fails in this case.
in my particular case, when i 'm on a dashboard, visualize link in nav panel has this html (and href url itself is 2983 characters long); phofcode but i
add a label to the checkbox so screenreader knows whats the context
the json from export should be valid and should import back into kibana
screenreader needs to be able to tell the user the section under which they are on.
ranges option should update accordingly to total number of hosts.
but it is not doing anything.
range wont change from the predefined range of 0-50, 50-75, 75-100.
user should be able to know their license information while tabbing and using screenreader.
aria level should be added so screen reader knows how to read it
recently viewed needs to be screenreader accessible.
button should remain stationary and not hop ;)
svg errors should not get displayed
i would expect most apps in kibana to respect the existing timespan except in the case where a dashboard is saved with the timespan.
this * might * somehow be related to phofurl in that issue, we see the time interval of each timelion visualization added to a dashboard impacts all others.
it could be another indication that timelion app doesn't share timepicker with kibana app but tries to have it's own instance
color rules should work as expected when metric values meets the rules configured.
color of the gauge should change
there should be a clear button to reset the setting and kibana shouldn 't break the listing page
the column heading for median is written as "50th percentile of median".
i would have expected this to be written just as "median" which would be similar behavior to "mean".
no radio button should be checked.
note: while radio buttons are mutually exclusive once one is checked there are definite use cases for having none selected to start with and this behavior is allowed in: 1. html `<input type=radio>` 2. windows ux guide phofurl
devtools should perform normally without crash
webp image icon will be displayed in draging.
if a proxy is set electron is expected to handle the **407 proxy authentication required** from the server by raising the `login` event and if that event does not have a handler then to throw an error that a proxy authentication is required.
the menu that appears below the app title (the one with file, edit, view...) must dissappear.
microphone access for electron browser window in windows10( docs have support for macos).
different file:// paths should be treated as different origins, according to @marshallofsound 's post here phofhyperlink : > unique file:// urls are all considered on different origins for security reasons, this is the same behavior as a browser however, different files appear to be able to share localstorage.
i 've attached a simple demo project.
index.html: phofcode child.html (as iframe): phofcode we expect child.html, which has a different file:// location, to not be able read index.html 's localstorage values.
`browserwindow` created in fullscreen mode
building electron on macos 10.15 and later should result in an application that can also be run on macos 10.14

`request.write` adds a request body to the request.
i expected no text artefact to stay when changing workbenches.
in our application we use (...) => ...)` to select a client certificate for client authentication.
when the session is finished type: 'clientcertificate ', origin: '... ' })` is called to remove the auth credentials.
when an other session starts we expect the (...) => ...)` callback to be called again so we can potentially select a different certificate for logging in.
a save dialog with filter extension adds that to the path.
calling `unref()` on a timer as returned by `setinterval` should work.
phofcode should not allow the user to select a directory and open it, without the `opendirectory` property.
at worst, if opened, the `result.filepaths` should be an empty list (or `result.canceled` should be set to `true`).
tray icon with the specified image created.
when creating a request with `net`, it should be possible to set the `host` header arbitrarily.
when doing a request with `net` and the server responds with a status-code that signifies an error, the user can still read the response's body.
based on the documentation, i expect that navigating to `"about:blank"` will trigger the webcontent 's `will-navigate` event.
window should be visible immediately after window.show() call.
everything except parent of the modal window should be clickable.
when dragging a frameless, transparent window (using `-webkit-app-region: drag;`) out of screen bounds (when part of the window is outside the desktop viewable area), it should remain transparent when dragged back to the viewport.
the "spin" button from the example should show up
when creating a request with `net`, if you explicitly set a `content-length` header, electron should send the request with this `content-length` header.
it should not throw below error `typeerror: cannot set property 'origin' of undefined`
`npm install electron --save-dev --save-exact` should successfully install electron.
normal startup / working app.
when clicking tray icons using the voiceover screen reader, the tray click event should fire.
browserwindow is displayed as fullscreen on the secondary screen
window should remain docked to its original size and location
when using `session.setproxy`, subesquent requests done with the `net` api with the specified session should use the proxy configured.
after manually resizing my window or with electron api func like `maximize` or `setbounds` i would like the `-webkit-app-region: drag` property to keep on working on a title bar with fixed width or/and height.
can double click in open file dialog.
the function should be callabe the same as if the electron app runs from a local drive (e.g.
app should not crash when uploading files
according to the docs, one should be able to register a stream protocol handler which serves files from the file system.
the following code snippet is suggested by the docs phofhyperlink : phofcode the expected behavior is that electron should read from the stream and (assuming no read errors etc.)
serve a valid response for custom protocol request.
form fields should render as intended
parameter is being handled according to spec: phofurl
i wrote an application that send post request with ** formdata ** or ** json ** to **flask python** server.
when in developer mode, the request is always successful with header : _"multipart/formdata"_ or _"application/json"._
when an electron window is opened with `backgroundthrottling: false` set in `webpreferences` it shouldn't throttle `settimeout` while window is minimized, but it does throttle it.
ismaximised() and isfullscreen() should return true if the window is maximised or in fullscreen
starting an app with a proxy server should not lead to a crash, the `login` event should be emitted.
should change the default logging path
`browserwindow` with `alwaysontop` should remain above other windows even after losing focus.
websites should load from a custom http protocol normally.
user should be able to drag html component with `-webkit-app-region: drag` to move window around.
the response of the cors post request is not empty.
yarn add electron --dev (it should work)
when building my angular project and running electron i expect have the following path visible in the sources tab in chrome developer tools (webpack:// > .
- open react devtools profiler - click "reload and start profiling" - await reload - do actions click "stop profiling" see profiler results
load react dev tools extension when opening developers tools and having react site loaded in browserwindow.
`backdrop-filter` has effect on the whole page.
window should stay always on top after setting it with setalwaysontop method, then hiding it and showing it again.
`electron-quick-start` / "hello world" application should run (and not crash).

app should remain working as normal, continue working as it should.
modals, file selectors, dialogs should be interactive (closable, movable, clickable, etc.)
the maximize() function maximizes the window as it would any other window.
the app should keep the same window size after those exact operations: 1. window not maximized // for example let's say the window is in the middle of the screen 2. window maximize // now window takes all screen space 3. window minimize // now window is hidden 4. window reopen clicking icon on taskbar // now is like in step 2 5. unmaximize now should be same size as in step 1

opening an electron application should not interfere with firefox.
when a browser window is opened as a modal to the primary renderer window, i would expect screen readers, such as nvda, to say something like "title dialog first or top level elements focus button".
for example, if i click the all categories... menu item in microsoft outlook, screen readers will announce "color categories dialog to assign... important checkbox not checked ".
here, "color categories" is the title bar, "to assign..." is the first descriptive element, and "important checkbox not checked" is element that receives focus first.
another example: if i select "define new bullet..." in microsoft word, screen readers will announce "define new bullet dialog bullet character preview ok button".
here, "define new bullet" title bar, "bullet character" and "preview" are top-level elements, and "ok" default dialog dismissal button.

electron should launch and display a window regardless of whether windows is in light or dark mode.
the documentation for the app events `browser-window-created` and `web-contents-created` state that the first parameter is an `event`.

the app should not crashed when use `window.open` in renderer process on electron5.0.x
electron apps should show their icon in systray settings of kde plasma desktop environment, like non-electron apps.
i 've created some simple code to replicate the issue: phofcode when the dialog shows up, the "cancel" button should be selected by default since `defaultid` is set to 1. however, the default button is "delete".
this is confirmed by pressing enter - in that case message `this button was pressed: 0` is displayed.

* mqtts protocol works * i am trying to upgrade an electron 2 app for windows.
one of the main things the app does is fork a process to listen to a message bus (mqtts).
it works in election 2 and 3 but not in any of the newer versions of election.
i need to upgrade the newest version of electron.
i would like to open a new child window and render content into it from script running in my `mainwindow`, rather than perform a navigation in the new child window.
this works when setting `nativewindowopen: true` for the main window and using `window.open('')` to open a window with location `about:blank`.
i would also like to load a preload script in the new window, so that i can configure the `webframe`.
in 4.1.5, setting preload script on main window caused preload script to also be loaded for child windows.
in 5.0.0, preload stopped loading for child window.
i would actually expect that providing in `new-window` event would work, as described here phofhyperlink and pointed out here phofhyperlink by @marshallofsound, but it doesn't.
i've tried various ways of using options that are passed into event, but none have worked: phofcode and phofcode phofcode
open a window with domain a via `window.open` et navigate to domain b in the opened window should keep the `window.opener` reference.

there should be a way to load a webview.src with http (so not https) as it is not required for this app https
i have an app that runs well on v3.1.8.
it is actually targeted for raspberry pi, so i kept on using that version, but now that v5.0.0 supports raspberry pi, i 've decided to start developing for it.
so, after testing it on my raspberry pi succesfully, i changed electron version to 5.0.0 in package.json on my mac 10.14 development machine, ran npm install and npm start.
i am calling the following require in my app index.html and using ipcrenderer to communicate with main.
the request should be logged including request/response headers just like a normal request.
normal chrome does the right thing in our webapp - just not in our desktop version.
when selecting a menu item, this should always count as a user gesture.
during mission control transitions or workspace transitions, the window should not flicker.
see the right window in the screenshot
a call to { types: 'screen '] })` should not cause the os to show the binoculars icon when the user locks the screen, this icon should only be shown when screen is being recorded.
as far as i know this icon is used to show that user is recording a screen.
[here phofhyperlink is explained this icon.
building the package should work as intended.
the app is able to use node modules.
the iframe is removed without causing any issue
the javascript code executed in the embedder frame (and not in the webview): phofcode should focus the embedder frame the javascript code executed in the embedder frame: phofcode should blur webview and focus embedder frame the javascript code executed in frame: phofcode should focus frame.
if i compile my app with electron 2.0.0 - 2.0.14, startup is fast - the browser window is created almost instantly.

when i started the electron project, it was called `paneer-app`.
i renamed it to `andrei-commander` and start time increased from 1 second to 5. i expect start time to be 1 second.
i can achieve that by setting `"name": "paneer-app"` in the `package.json` for the main (renderer does not matter)
`dialog.showmessagebox` would not block the process since it has got a `callback`.
it's stated in the docs phofhyperlink the following: > if a callback is passed, the dialog will not block process.
the api call will be asynchronous and result will be passed via callback(response).
the documentation for nativeimage phofhyperlink states that "you can put images with different sizes in the same folder and use the filename without dpi suffixes" to support displays with different dpis.
i have prepared files `name.png` and `name@2x.png`.
in the code i am using just `name.png` to refer to it.
i expected it to use the `@2x` version of a png when displaying on a macbook retina screen, and version without a suffix when displaying on an older external non-retina monitor.
display the video in full screen mode when the button "fullscreen" embeded in the video is clicked.
when using i expect to have a complete list of the applications that are open.
including if they are in full screen mode or not.
i am using `ipcrenderer` to send a filelist object from the renderer process to the main process so i can retrieve metadata from the files on the main process side.
here is code on renderer side that sends files: (my app is made with react + redux) phofcode and code on main process side to service event and grab files: phofcode i expect to receive a filelist object that looks something like this: phofcode

the testsuite passes on circleci 's `build-mac` workflow
my app used the windowmenu role for a menu template in electron v4 which worked as expected.
in v5 my app failed to compile as typescript alerted me to a change in expected values.
i see the docs now reflect window as the correct value for this functionality so i changed and recompiled, expecting it to work...
render process does not crash.
when i update electron from 2.0.9 to 4.1.3, i expect the ui performance to be the same (or better).

it should load the video properly.
electron help prints: phofcode from this help, i expect using a url instead of a directory to work the same way, but instead it just display the content of files.
expected behavior: * open electron window * display "we are using node.js 10.11.0, chromium and electron 4.1.1."
not expecting there to be any extra delay in the main process ' rest server to receive a message from the renderer process sending an http get to localhost when application first starts up.

when navigations occur, a new process should be created for the navigation.
i hope use robotjs in web worker
the browserwindow.isvisible phofhyperlink documentation specifies that the `isvisible` method should return whether the window is currently visible to the user.
when minimizing the window on mac, i can see that visibility is false.
i would expect same behavior on windows.
when using the `browserwindow` option `baseurlfordataurl` i expected consecutive reloads to have this base url be constant.
i developed a spa with react and use electron to make it a desktop app.
but i found that all my http:// request were transfer to file:// request, so i have to use to transfer original http:// request, **but all the post request seems like that lost the body parameter.
i 'm using a fork of this code : phofurl important part is : phofcode expected behavior : the executejavascript is run on dom-ready, resulting in a log output, and in my case the ipc send event to a useful function.
(namely : application icon change)

i do not know the underlying mechanisms that trigger this error, but i have a project in which i bundle all of `yarn.js` in order to install projects from within my electron app.
in electron v4.0.4, this no longer works for some native modules in node_modules, as their executables get left out.
for code that calls `.focus()` on a webview and then `.focus()` on another element, the other element should end up focused: phofcode
the tray menu displays the same speed as normal.
adding `<input type="checkbox" />` to the dom in a sandboxed renderer process should work.
** note: ** needs to be called in electron 4.0 and older.
if a window is minimised then restored, it retains its original size.
i'd expect that if a main window has a child, and that child window has a child (grandchild), then the grandchild also gets closed when the main/grandparent window is closed.
passing an url to an electron application with a custom protocol handler, like described in phofurl should preserve the colon in the url.
if the protocol was myelectronapp://, typing myelectronapp:// phofurl in another browser should open the electron application and pass phofurl as url argument in ** open-url ** event.
the application should start as normal

context isolation should be enabled in subframes when the option is provided.
according to the documentation, the isvisible method on a browserwindow instance should return, "whether the window is visible to the user.".
if window is not visible to user due to other application windows being in foreground, expected behavior is that `isvisible` will return false.
i 've written a menu handler that looks like this: phofcode i expect using the menu item to toggle the class on the '.nav ' element in every window.
setting a menuitem to `visible: false` will hide it from the menu but ** not ** disable it.
phofcode in nodejs v10.15.0 / nodejs v8 / nodejs v6 / electron v1.8.x / electron 2.x, the timeout function registered by will not trigger after download success.
and printfilesizesafterbuild will show optimization changes after gzip.
we expected one common css chunk with common css and chunks with specific component css
`npm run build` should collect and build the project into the `build` dir
an app should have been created.
i might be missing something, but i would expect that react-app-polyfill is loosely coupled to 'core-js', so should be using '~' or ''.
this would allow downstream consumers to collapse dependencies, assuming they provide a compatible version.
the app should have been created based on the template in the scoped package.
`yarn audit` should show no vulnerabilities
the opacity value should be minified as the same value in the source file.
i would expect it to run my react app as normally.
it should not be caught by eslint
the parameter does not have to be configurable at all.
it would be enough to generate a unique string at build time for the webpack config.
a build hash could do the trick.
alternatively, a configuration of the webpack output.webpackjsonp config to allow multiple cra apps on a single page would solve the issue.
consider a widget approach where each cra app will be widget on portal.
to load the svg as the documentation mentions
target directory is not created and no files are generated.
contrast should meet aa requirements (it _does_ in dark mode).
(write what you thought would happen.)
entire site is coverted into the dark theme with shades of black (or close to black)
`common.module.scss` will have its styles in the `<head>` of the page, and the scss variables would be preprocessed out to regular css.
the element will have the correct styles applied to it from common.module.scss.
it should look like this: <img width="487" alt="screenshot at 5 05 05 pm" src=" phofurl
(write what you thought would happen.)
can use svg like png image, like `impot svgimage from "./icon.svg"` i think only need to add `/ .svg$/` into url-loader for image above.
react build process will spit out a build folder with project files.
app is initialized and cra gitignore is appended to existing .gitignore
i expected to be taken to a page on making a progressive web app

i expected to just see my minimized/uglified code
expect it not to display the message again or not display it in the first place.
test should pass instead of failing.
it should import the local image files correctly
my fonts are found in phofurl
maybe we can got a warning, but the project should built succeed as always.
tests seem to pass for some prs and on master since a few days ago.
i wonder why i cannot run those tests locally or if it 's a "known" issue and if there 's some workaround that i can use.
no eslint failures since the variables are being used in the for .. of loops
(write what you thought would happen.)
the node module should be mocked.
css should update without refreshing the whole app.
i expected that the styles would be applied without reloading the application in the browser as the tool previously behaved.
i would expect the 1 test to run.
i would expect the `setupfilesafterenv` of the config to be merged with the cli arguments.
polyfill import should not throw an exception because of the missing window object.
(write what you thought would happen.)
i am aware of the solutions provided in #2549 phofhyperlink and #6068 phofhyperlink .
asking users to increase the limit only pushes the problem further without resolving it.
and in my opinion is a workaround for a bad design.
it also provides a less than ideal user experience and unnecessarily raises the bar for newbie developers.
the `npm start` script should either: 1. not watch all files in project by default, only project files.
the script can then ask user to restart app after updating dependencies and show info to how to enable watching `node_modules` if they want recompile automatically after updating dependencies.
from my experience it's better restart application after dependencies have been updated rather than rely on watch due problems with watching and compiling source files in linked npm modules (if used of course).
2. watch all files but detect when amount is beyond system limits.
the script can show a warning user telling them there is problem how resolve it, then fall back not watching `node_modules` until it's resolved.
detecting how many files is project quite quick: phofcode 3. watch all but there should be another script similar `start` that skips watching `node_modules`.
providing such script, say `quick-start`, could also serve as quick example how exclude certain folders from watcher should user opt do that.
in any case scripts documentation phofhyperlink and/or troubleshooting phofhyperlink and/or advanced configuration guide should mention that `start` will attempt automatically watch all project, including `node_modules`.
then it be documented enable or disable (depending on what's default behavior) specific folders, including enable or disable `node_modules`.
(write what you thought would happen.)
image's url should looks like : ` phofurl js url should looks like : ` phofurl css url should looks like : ` phofurl
i thought the build process would ignore files suffixed with `.test.
{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and not include them in the bundle.
since none of the test files are imported into any of the app 's code (they just sit along side it) i found it weird.
it should import the local image files correctly
it should look like this phofurl and the compiled stylesheet should something like this phofurl
no error and the function alongside react should run smoothly.
no eslint warnings should be shown.
editing the css module should be hot reloaded.
~the server to start~ edit: i expect to see an error about an invalid eslintrc.
perhaps suggesting that `react-app` needs to be extended.
the app to continue to be started.
at least in the case of an already existing app with already existing editor configuration.
mocks are picked up by jest
it should just accept eslint 6
i expected the test to pass.
when i paste the code line-by-line into my firefox console, i get the expected output: `[ "foo" ]`
i thought it would create a new react application for me
`promise.allsettled` should be polyfilled (output below from chrome): phofcode
no error occurs and app start sucessfully
`build/index.html` should contain the minified version of the entire snippet with `%node_env%` replaced with `production`.
react should give the proper value and not overriding its content because of special characters.
especially since i used double quotes and backslash expression to avoid the confusion when setting the variables.
this seems to be an issue with react when it redefines and filters the process.env object since i don 't have this issue with plain js or when running a node console.
for now i use dotenv to avoid that behavior but it is still an issue worthy of note.
display 404 path not found default error.
server should run with information about server access url
this worked fine for the past two weeks or so, but it doesn 't seem to work anymore today.
i expect it to proxy all traffic except for the sockjs-node endpoint as this breaks webpack-dev-server.
would prefer that package.json of react-scripts brings in a later version of webpack-dev-server such as 3.7.2. in that version, the live.bundle.js brings in the v3.4.1 version of jquery which is not vulnerable based on the cve above.
this should fix it for us and not give us a medium level vulnerability.
the `--coverage` flag should fail tests when the coverage threshold is not met.
redux-logger shouldn't be in the production bundle.
using the latest version of babel should not trigger github "known security vulnerabilities detected" warnings.
should 've compiled without errors.
should create a folder (react app) with name react-test-app
1. the browser should be updated with the changes you made to the component body 2. socket connection to `sockjs-node` should not fail.
3. there should be no errors/warnings in the console 4. it should not prevent custom socket connection
the built project should contain the image files, and they not be base64 encoded within the js bundle
i expected the react js would send a signal to the process, it will run and receive the appropiate response.
to ignore specified files from eslint checks and start the app.
talking here mostly about generated files which we cannot just modify with the comment to disable eslint.
the best course of action is to just ignore these.
quite an exhaustive issue phofurl talks about customizing eslint config, but not much of the mention of utilizing `.eslintignore` which isn't exactly huge customization and shouldn't be prohibited like that.
i can use a workaround with `cra-override`, but i don't want to disable a conflicting rule for a whole project when the only a bunch of generated files is affected.
start the application fine with the demo page in localhost.
(write what you thought would happen.)
should the installation commands read `npm install --save-dev xxxx` and `yarn add --dev xxxx` since there are dev dependencies instead of production dependencies
re-export should work and app 's behavior should be unchanged.
the breakpoint wouldn 't move and i would be able to hit it when i click the `add` button in my todo list.
hot reloading working, this particular websocket request not being forwarded to the proxy target.
i expected that i could try to import a file and fallback to the default if the file doesn 't exist.
i can, but only in the production build.
app should boot up in ie11 in dev mode with polyfills suggested here phofurl applied.
it should run the application without any errors.
user sees documentation on register a service worker.
i expect that the variables created from postcss-modules-values are available with module and non-module css/scss files.
because it behave exactly like this in my gatsby-project.
.env vars should change when i update or delete them.
give me some way to ignore specific files/directories from being linted, or give me an option turn errors into warnings so i can choose to ignore false positives.
the `title` of the page should be `callback page` after navigating to `callback.html`.
expected to create a react app
no error and the code gets formatted.
i expect to see `<script></script>` on the screen.
should render the page normally
both and side navbar render it correctly as `function1 [array<string>]`
dev server should start successfully.
autogenerated toc for the above heading should have the following markup: phofcode
styles should not be duplicated (re-injected) when moving to other pages.
escaping the `|` when using ` `
no compile errors, we see the link directly to the doc in the sidebar.
the theme of code blocks should be `nightowl`
`/docs` should render `docs/index.md` or redirect to a specificed document.
2. the navbar item remains active as long as you are in the `/docs` sectiono.
should not route to 'page not found'
we could seemingly swizzle component from utimately, we want to be able to use 2 different `logo.src`.
we could define a `logo.src.dark` & `logo.src.light` for example.
i expect for the title to show in in the right toc just as it would if i provided a `
> 1st block quotes > 2rd block quotes
refer accessibility docs to background and foreground colour contrast ratio (write what you thought would happen.)
the colour should be the same as if it was in light mode.
the generated `href` matches and works when clicked.
i would expect the algolia search results to be displayed correctly, without the big gap in the center
clicking on the search result that matches the page title should have taken me to that page anchored to the page title properly.
it should be displayed like this: image phofimage
the build would work the same way as it does when `--skip-next-release` option is not used.
the relative links should not be broken.
i expect that clicking on "go to inner2" from phofurl will open the inner2 page, just like on phofurl
docusaurus should include these meta tags same as phofurl my guess is that this issue is due to the latest release of docusaurus.
happy to provide more details if needed.
phofcode does not crash and produces docs
the correct page to be shown in both step 2 and 4.
the sidebar should be present in any new document created.
project is created inside test dir
it should start with the port and host specified
the requested host ip address should persists after reloads, this is important for live reload to work.
an alert should pop up, and output should appear in the console.
because of event.preventdefault(), page should not be refreshed.
i would hope when i type cleanurl, the matching page would show up only once, it is confusing to me as a newish user why i see double matches.
without exploring i asked "are they the same documents/copy?"
files in the build directory are copied to github.
navigation wouldn 't flicker and group wouldn 't animate unnecessarily.
versioned docs are saved by `yarn version`.
i believe that docusaurus should strip markdown out of page descriptions when generating them.
i expected that only css files from the `css` folder would be included in the css bundle.
just show `referencing site documents` image phofimage and not show `<span id="jump">` part when on real website.
the translation should be able to open, and the translation of title in sidebar and document should be used.
(write what you thought would happen.)
the footer renders consistently across all pages.
sidebas exhibit the same scroll behavior they do in chrome (write what you thought would happen.)
the code component should handle react elements for children gracefully.
there should be no errors in console and `.active` class should be toggled on links in toc
the `docusaurus-examples` script should copy the config files (listed in the docs here phofhyperlink ): phofcode
the server is suposed to start, and when i do changes inside the website folder, the webpage is suposed to reload with the new changes.
e.g when i change a label on the headerlinks section, changes are suposed to be visible.
being able to add a custom page similar to any other markdown page with the only difference the content is written using react.
table of content should render that header as `/<context>/status` (write what you thought would happen.)
the expected behavior is that the heading will see its child anchor and inherit the hash (`id`) from it instead of using its text content to generate the hash.
there would be a subcategory present with the links to the subdirectory as declared.
go to the general page phofhyperlink .
(write what you thought would happen.)
a leaf node (page title like "cheatsheet") or the next-highest heading ("dom testing library") should be shown at the top <img width="537" alt="screen shot at 11 44 02 am" src=" phofurl <img width="534" alt="screen shot at 11 43 51 am" src=" phofurl
the page mentioned above should have the same content as which located in ** ** .
generated page of en-us phofhyperlink but obviously there are less content in the zh-cn document.
generated page of zh-cn phofhyperlink
(write what you thought would happen.)
i expect to get all the demo files after running `docusaurus-init` command i.e.
this directory structure root-directory doc1.md doc2.md doc3.md exampledoc4.md exampledoc5.md website core footer.js package.json pages sidebars.json siteconfig.js static
jump to the `#foo_bar` section.
i expected to see the new page rendered in my dev server as well as the sidebar updated while previously released version docs are unchanged.
**example #1:** expected "do that" to be #2 **example #2:** expected code tabs to be properly indented and nested inside the numbered list.
the above steps should generates a proper link to `doc2.html` in both dev server and also when the site is built for publishing
should have `html` tab: image phofimage
(write what you thought would happen.)
the title and sidebar label of the first page of the docs for the versioned docs are accurate.
(write what you thought would happen.)
the open menu should have closed.
everything is all good so i can run `npm start`.
show logo as usual (write what you thought would happen.)
i 'd expect the default initial setup to be slick.
for example, this does not happen in the prettier phofhyperlink docs.
the header should contain: phofcode
it should automatically show a scrollbar in the table of contents if there are too many items.
if you put directly the link without reference.
this is how it should render in all systems phofurl phofhyperlink .
images are rendered even when `docsurl: ''` configuration is used.
that, if an issue with a link arose, the new website would not be published
image should be displayed in the default location.
i expect document id, path, sidebar reference and url to follow a consistent pattern, instead of four different ones.
i would expect something like this: phofcode _i would also expect the versioned url to be available immediately, not only when the next version is published.
but that's also another issue._
when running the website locally, the image should be shown.
clicking on the "documentation" link would take me to the pages that are created when clicking on the docs link from the top navigation bar.
not sure what to expect from "release notes" link because i can 't find any related configurations in previous steps or in `siteconfig.js`
output should be an `<h2>` followed by `<ul>...</ul>`
there's no gap in the header.
the build should pass without error and the website should be able to render.
simple markdown file links would resolve correctly to the generated page urls.
- i expected the title / content to change after restarting the dev server.
- i expected to see the new page in the side bar.
website running correct, show my docs
the sidebar should not contain broken links.
the build should succeed with versioning enabled even if ids are not unique, but in different folders.
i took the code from the example above, made all ids unique, and it works.
you can check it out like this: 1.
`git checkout -b reproduceme2` 3.
`npm run version 1.0.0` 7.
`npm run version 2.0.0` 9.
phofurl should show the left toc just like: phofurl
page should refresh regardless of how many times.
it should still use the page title instead of the generic "previous/next".
in my opinion, it could be way more user-friendly if we could show to the user potentially as much of clear text as possible.
so from example described in actual behavior part of this issue, i think that rendered og:description can look like: phofcode
this to be hosted on github pages: image phofimage
the site would be published
expected to see the image, or text of the * rendered * markdown, now the raw markdown text.
a balanced padding underneath the algolia / docsearch logo
search results with a good ux.
site works both locally and when published.
sidebar title and page title should be displayed as:- image phofimage
run prod, see that the custom highlighting should be picked up
a sample site running in port 3000
a normally formatted post: <img width="1920" alt="screen shot at 1 54 40 pm 2" src=" phofurl
i expected all files in all subdirectories of website/static to be copied into the corresponding subdirectores of website/build.
is this a correct assumption?
should i put doxygen-generated files under website/pages instead?
bash-3.2$ diff ~/api.files ~/build.files 26d25 < doxygen.css 54d52 < tabs.css
demos folder will be part of the build folder
the title of the page and label on the sidebar are expected to be different.
live website should be in sync with markdown files in the repo
errors should not be thrown
the urls should be like ` phofurl
when setting cleanurl to `true`, docusaurus generates correct asset links to parent directory, where `asset` directory is located.
i would expect the output to be highlighted differently between `text` and `js` code blocks, like this: phofcode phofcode
then image should show up.
css should load fine and styles should be applied to the static pages.
images put under /website/static/img should load.
no error in the console (write what you thought would happen.)
i think renaming doc files should be supported.
this test should run and should be ok.
jest should close the express server in the afterall hook and not leave any open handles
the same behavior as with `toequal()` where only the different `value` property is reported.
note that when the value is not different both `tomatchobject()` and `toequal()` pass the test with no differences detected.
the page scrolls to the heading you selected.
ideally a memo component would render as it did prior to react 16.12
all tests should be passed successfully without any errors such as `syntaxerror: cannot use 'import.meta' outside a module`
something in the output says that jest failed the test because it can 't guarantee that the promise rejection will be handled.
for instance, instead of: phofcode something like: phofcode
ideally it should be possible to install @types/expect or import only expect types from @types/jest
the validation to proceed as expected
re-importing the library works just fine.
the test case names should not be displayed in the console.
i expect this test... phofcode ...to succeed.
instead it fails with: phofcode
no error should be displayed and the test should pass or fail as expected.
running a piece of code through `babel-node` and through `jest` should have the same behavior.
settimeout to run after a promise resolves.
no left-pad to appear as a dependency
jest is able to locate `jest.setup.js` files via a normal glob pattern to enable monorepo workflows.
consistent behavior between `jest-jasmine` and `jest-circus`
i 'd expect output something like the following: phofcode
as documented phofhyperlink : it should return `42`
it is expected to return different value depending on exact module name.
all the text, code excepted, should be in portuguese.
i'm willing to do the translation and make a pull request myself, i'm just not sure where in the repo the files for internationalized docs are
by default, it should only use half of the available cores of the machine to ensure that it is unobtrusive.
documentation for `clearmocks`, `resetmocks` and `restoremocks` should use word "before" instead of "between"
jest should throw an exception saying that step declaration it wrong.
is this happening because of jest considering ** then ** before step definitions is not an error?
an exception is thrown so i can catch it like this is done for other matchers.
i expected to successfully create snapshots, because value satisfy the property matcher constrains.
instead i get the follwing error.
i 'm expecting the given test data to be printed to the console phofcode
it should generate valid paths such as
instead, the following error message is provided: phofcode this is based on my `jest.config.js`.
note that if i comment out the line that aliases out the `static` folder path, the test runs fine.
i expect it to be described so the functionality created can be used.
#6649 i am happy to update the documentation if required
the document should not be null.
that it uses the resolved mock data i provide and not even remotely touch the real fetch that's wrapped up in a helper
i am able to mock a static method on an es6 class while still being able to use instance methods and it's constructor
test.todo should work as expected and issue a report of todo tests
i expect all the tests to be found and run
the tests are expected to run faster with mocked classes than usual code execution
no error, jest should support private class fields with the `#` syntax, since they can be used in node.js 12 without flags or transpilers.
the test runs without problems
no failure with the cli option.
"yarn test" should work without errors.
only the tests in the `describe` block containing the `test.only` call should be skipped.
otherwise, test.only is a kill switch for the entire test file.
i could spy on component
the `original error` is printed in a console.log and is outputed as the error failing the test.
the `some uncaught error later` is outputted as an uncaught error produced by the test.
i think the message is supposed to say: `unrecognized option "u".
i 'd expect jest to add some overhead and could live with it being 2, even up to 10 times, slower than node.
but 150 times slower is unworkable.
jest should not throw any error as this is just import of import.
system: os: windows 10 cpu: (8) x64 intel(r) core(tm) i7-8650u cpu @ 1.90ghz binaries: node: 10.9.0 - c: program files odejs ode.exe yarn: 1.17.3 - pm yarn.cmd npm: 6.2.0 - c: program files odejs pm.cmd npmpackages: jest: 24.8.0 => 24.9.0
`datatransfer` is available globally and test passes.
the command should calculate and cache initial test results for and coverage information **for all files** and then on next iteration the coverage and test results should be updated only for changed files / tests.
since everything but the `% funcs` are at `100%` i would also expect the `% funcs` to be at `100%`
redis should be mocked and test should pass successfully
is should only collect util.js , but it collect react components, i set react components test phofcode is this impact collectcoveragefrom
watch should run as expected.
the tests should run very quickly.
only the single test should be in the output.
does not crash with phofcode
when both fields are uncommented should not highlight `ts` as wrong but `userid` should
i expect jest.requireactual to follow the rules from babel like jest.mock does
both `expect()` assertions shoudl fail (as they do) but show `"received: serializes to the same string` for the field `foo`.
should be able to read the documentation and quickly see how to mock a named export as well as a default export.
i should be able to test my stub as intended
the content of the first test should be in the second snapshot the content of the second test should be in the second snapshot
`--detectopenhandles` should not show a warning for this interval, but it does.
should fail the test, but not throw range error
in the demo project 's test case at if toggle the default imports with this one: phofcode then the tests will pass.
it seems that the static property initializations are incompatible with jest: phofcode
the coverage should complete this with 100% coverage.
however, my first method appears to covered, but the second method, in this case "rebuildlisttwo" appears to not be covered, even though they are.
`require()` in jest should behave the same as `require()` in vanilla node.js, especially if using the node test environment.
the spiedon method should be called regardless of the spy
test of module `./a` is run when running `jest --only-changed`.
the success of the test depends on changes of the mock file - so changing the mock should trigger the test - same way as changing `./b` directly does.
the scenario is not uncommon - could happen when someone is extending functionality of `./b`, or works on another module that depends on it.
jest runs with the appropriate testurl as part of the configuration
but the result is phofcode
`core.ls` gets compiled using `jest.ls.transformer` and there is no error.
the promise is resolved or rejected with an objected describing the failed test
"jest-config" correctly read the configs when there is only one project specified in root 's jest.config.js
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
1. create `sum.js` phofcode 2. create `sum.test.js` phofcode 3. modify package.json phofcode 4. run `npm run test` phofcode
memory heap usage should not increase or at least not as much.
the number of terminal-notifier processes should not increase towards infinity with each notification, and cpu usage should be negligible.
not to show the notify window when `notifymode` is `failure` and all tests pass.
it show a diff instead of throwing an error.
instead, it fails because it is unable to find the class name associated with the div.
** samplecomponent.tsx: ** phofcode ** ** phofcode **test output:** phofcode jest.config.js: phofcode
`afterall` should be called after `aftereach` finishes, i.e.
after it prints `'aftereach ending'` interestingly, if you `throw` inside the test itself (and not on the `request` callback), it works.
when ran in a non-jest environment (i.e.
node cli), both promise.resolve and promise.all resolve into an array for which === array.prototype` is true.
when ran with `testenvironment` set to `jsdom` both tests pass.
i'm expecting it to be the case for `testenvironment: node`.
this is the reason why i'm reporting it here.
it could still be an issue with something else, so any help investigating is very much welcome.
i expect the error to tell me that one of my `roots` item does not exist.
but ideally, this should just skip the non-existent folder and continue searching through the existing ones.
project level config can define / override `collectcoveragefrom`, `coveragethreshold` and other options.
exact filename and line number where logger is called is displayed e.g.
console.log ` console console.log console - i logged something too console.log {"message":"winston - i logged something too","level":"info"} console.log console - i logged something before failure {"message":"winston - i logged something before
error message should accurately report the timeout limit phofcode
throws, because `{}` does not have a property `a
the output for the fourth case should include the thrown object, just as in the second case.
note that the fourth case incorrectly reports a line number at start of function, so it's not helpful (if we could get line number of incorrect `throw` that would be ideal, but i understand that that's probably not possible).
i ran into this with a throw that occurred deep in a series of libraries so it was very difficult to track down.
i expect this test case to fail, however it will pass.
should ignore the files in console in the screenshot,
i expect the tests to pass as well when not run in band.
if `testpathignorepatterns` is not defined in the project, i expect the root `testpathignorepatterns` to take effect.
i expect unit tests to work after upgrading babel-jest
`jest-circus` works in a browser environment either by not using node specific packages or by, in the source, catching and preventing errors for non-node environments.
stack trace should contain full filenames.
fyi: i've inspected the code of package, and it indeed supplies inline source maps.
include an additional field for the _source_ file in #/testresults/n
paste the results here: following is the error when i am importing and using phofcode
jest.fn((a,b) => 1) //returns a function of length 2.
=> 1) //returns a function of length 2.
=> 1))(1) //returns a function expecting one param (length 1) => 1))(1) //returns a function expecting one param (length 1)
i'd expect if package.json changes, to give up changedsince and run all tests.
maybe instead of package.json you could use package-lock.json.
ideally, there should be another way to pass environment options to jest worker, worker compatible.
if it is not possible, jest should at least try to detect attempts to pass classes as `testenvironmentoptions` and raise an error or warning clearly stating the problem.
i want to get a response in the on tag event of the script tag, in fact the onload event is not fired.
i expect the relative path `./data/rules.json` not to be mapped using the rule `"data/(.
*)": "<rootdir>/src/data/$1"` so that the `psl` package can function properly.
ideally, while code coverage requires all this markup in the source maps, the source maps would be generated anew after the code coverage has completed so as to enable a smooth debugging experience.
it should pass the test run but it is showing syntax error
not use try catch if not needed
i expect run smoothly because already defined locales in modulename mapper jest setup
the failure should show up with the same speed regardless of datatypes, possibly by truncating values, as `console.log` does when there is deep nesting.
in the above example, i 'd expect both `expect()`-chains to return `undefined` and not throw anything (since `obj` is a valid subset of itself).
test should not timeout, e.g.
it doesn 't happen if `jest-circus` runner is used.
the test linked above should pass since the `withancestor` option should return both the current changes and the changes in the last commit.
currently, pattern we use to specify a `revset` errors because pattern specifies an empty range.
**i managed to solve this locally myself, by using `ancestors(.
)::0` as argument for `--revset`, but i'm not sure whether this solution covers all necessary edge-cases**.
since i don't use `mercurial` myself i thought it was better to open an issue and see what other mercurial users think of this solution.
if this is a satisfactory solution i can open a pr as i already have these changes commited to branch phofhyperlink .
the "expected a string" error should not occur.
a properly aligned table (the vs code integrated terminal does not have this issue):.
the above test should pass.
no unnecessary typescript files when downloading jest packages.
all js files being covered (green), no coverage errors
it's expected to pass, but it's failing with error: > typeerror: is not a function the same code run by node.js works just fine and returns 'element'
jest and babel work together to transpile `user.js` properly.
mock restoration should work regardless of whether the method is defined higher up on the prototype chain or not.
if is false, when `jest.spyon(b, 'test ')` is restored, jest should just delete `b.test` rather than assign a value that might have existed only on b 's prototype.
none of the `console.log` should be called.
the correct behavior of the `beforeeach` should also be applied to `beforeall`.
the variable should be defined.
should only runs tests related to the changes since the provided branch
this syntax is supported by commonjs for requiring the index of a folder and should be supported by jest as well.
the test shouldn't fail when is testing projects which import css
same result when running individually test and the suite.
all the generated snapshots have the same indentation.
jest does not print warning when ran with `--passwithnotests`
there should be no error, commenting the _react_ import line allows the test to run and pass as normal.
the codebase seems have a convention of using `diffstring` to contain the `diff()` result phofhyperlink , would be a good idea to update the code example to consistently use `diffstring` instead (i.e.
replace all instances of `difference` to `diffstring`).
importing `expect` in a ts project does not augment global interfaces with jest-specific type declarations.
the coverage report file should contain the code coverage values and the code coverage results should still be outputted to the console as occurs when "coveragereporters" is omitted.
jest should fail with exit code 1 as the coverage limits are set to 50% and the test returned 0%.
it should use only 20% of my cpus
in my original code, i wanted to see how well typescript's tests covered the typescript compiler.
i should see three executed test cases, but see only one test we run <img width="451" alt="screen shot at 11 44 41 am" src=" phofurl
should work, but doesn 't
`jest --onlychanged` should re-run the tes
the paths that are on a separate drive should not be resolved relatively to the rootdir, but should be taken as is.
we're using a patch that does this and that seems to solve the issue.
should be the values given in `./jest.config.js`
just like the cli-option the configuration option is documented too.
`.stryker-tmp` renamed to `stryker-tmp` and result is ok. phofcode
put a disclaimer of the problem into documentation, both into callbacks async phofhyperlink and each phofhyperlink sections
test file path with previous i mentioned should work correctly
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
jest should not find any tests, since `foo2` isn't a match for `foo`.
i would 've expected either the correct test to be blamed or an uncaught promise rejection warning, with an additional note to the user that uncaught promise rejections may cause the wrong test to be blamed.
if a test succeeds when running the test using `test.only()` the test should also succeed when running all tests with the option `--runinband`.
i'd expect the following output: phofcode or phofcode in both cases, the given mock name is present, making the output easy to reason about.
i think it is passed
jest should ignore the snapshot because it has a different signature + ava files are binary files.
// jest snapshot v1 ``
tests run and at the very worst, fail.
coverage info shows up when i edit a file after starting watch mode, and when i press 'a' to show all tests.
should run fine without errors on macos upgrading the dependency should hopefully fix the issue without creating problems.
note: i tried to use the resolutions block in my package.json file but it doesn't work with optionaldependencies like fsevents.
thanks in advance for your hard work
one line of "testenvironment setup!"
i would expect that the beforeeach execution should never start while an aftereach execution is still in progress.
the testenvironment file is transformed.
as documented here phofhyperlink , > use .tomatchobject to check that a javascript object matches a subset of the properties of an object.
it will match received objects with properties that are not in the expected object.
since the `expected` objects is a subset of `received` objects, i expect my test to pass.
test passes with no issues
tests should run without any errors
test title ought to be "clear test title" as it is on node.js v8 and v10.
when a beforeeach times out, it would be nice if it was clearly stated that the problem happened within the beforeeach.
i would also expect the tests that depend on the beforeeach not to be executed.
jest should not say there are obsolete snapshots, or else it should be able to delete them if they exist
it is expected for jest to know about globals.
the imported json file should be json.parsed like before with 24.7.1 per default.
if someone needs custom transformation, providing a transformation file is fine, but it should not be a requirement.
inline snapshots should stay put.
i expect the console.error output to be visible in the terminal.
instead, i see this: image phofimage
given we already produced the snapshot corresponding to this test, re-running it should succeed with no error.
current behavior is the follwoing: phofcode
provide a mock without failing.
the tests run as they should.
i would have expected the assertion to fail with the first variant above.
snapshot of the test(s) matching the pattern should be updated.
all other snapshots should remain intact
the test should run with no issues.
if babel-loader can run it then babel-jest should.
the mocked module behaves the same with `requireactual` as it would without being mocked.
`jest` works as expected, shows coverage info phofcode `jest --watch` does not show any coverage phofcode
execution order must be same
should be able to watch the tests for changes
all the tests pass, as they would if you use `mockreturn` instead of `mockreturnonce`.
expecting both consoles will be printed before executing the test.
but it is not printing it, instead runs the test case itself
i preferred the @types/jest as their test function has the third time out argument, which caused the error.
jest tells me that the error happened, in the same manner it does when i run the `describe` block.
jest also shouldn 't complain about a describe callback shouldn 't have a return value (which it does *even if* i 'm running the `describe` block - let me know if you 'd like me to make a separate issue for this)
mocking returning value not cause error.
i expect a passing test, or a test error.
i would expect that when coverage is set to true, and collectcoverage is passed a glob for all files in the repo, that the generated coverage report would be for all files.
i would expect this behavior to be consistent.
i would expect jest to not go beyond a certain number of workers if the argument is not specified
the test above should fail, the async assertion should be ignored towards the assertion count.
the promise chain, where the expect is executing is not part of the test.
we can tell that because test is not marked as failing even with a blatantly broken assertion.
when expect runs test is "complete" and should not be counted as part of `assertioncount` in jest.
i 'd expect `this.equals` to be defined in both invocations.
each of the configs, when `require`d, will have `rootdir` set to the directory where the `jest.config.js` is.
because the configs don't specify them.
jest should inform the developer that **the beforeall() function** timed out.
other properties are evaluated when object is iterable.
like when removing the iterators from above code: phofcode
i expect `tothrow` and `tothrowerror` to work consistently in both typescript and babel environment.
when i run the tests, i would expect the material-ui/core/es files to be transformed and then the tests to run without issue.
**note that importing without `core/es/` works.
** : the regex seems to be ok: phofurl
jest shouldn't try to run that test
a resolved promise is returned it passes.
i expected a text summary of code coverage at the end, which would list total percentages of covered lines, etc.
there should be a predictable way to catch any `warning` events on the current process in node.js.
to keep the issue simple, i am only mentioning `warning`, but the same issue happens with `multipleresolves` and `rejectionhandled` process events.
jest 24 should transpile test and src files using babel 6
i expect the repl to succeed.
instead, the repl throws "javascript heap out of memory" by jest.
it should match only the relative path.
instead matching phofcode it should match phofcode
2. the test fails saying variable is undefined.
stops test or retries beforeall x amount of times defined.
for jest to understand how construct a template string.
npm install runs without error.
using `jest` with the same number of workers than cores should always equal or improve the execution time of `jest --maxworkers=1`.
the app.js test should pass.
async functions should work in describe block so that we can group the things
test should pass as lodash.foo() returns 5, as specified in `__mock__/lodash.js`
i expected the following two objects to be equal: const foo = {a:_in=>_in} const bar = {a:_in=>_in}
the test should be found when using the symlinked path
i would expect both tests to pass.
a jest.fn() being returned does not appear to satisfy the condition `[k in keyof t]: t[k] extends (...args: any[]) => any` in if it is necessary to explicitly cast jest.fn() return from mocks, this should be reflected in the documentation.
it change path and can correct require file
as you can see, where i was expecting something like `memo(mainmenu)`, i 'm getting `<component />`.
what 's worse is, that if i replace the render in app to, instead of using `<mainmenu />`, to use another memoized component, the snapshot will still pass because it won 't notice the difference.
tests should work as before.
i want coverage reports to output
it should run, but what happens is it throws errors and warnings.
all tests should pass, but in fact all tests fail
i should work the same way as the previous assertion or if this is expected behavior, the output message should explain what 's wrong.
i 'd expect `await to work just like `await for the same reason it does work on the syncronous version.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
if you are using internationalization then it should show the correct language.
jest tests should not fail and run flawlessly
that either: * the babel options sanitisation not change in a minor version * (or if this is seen as an internal implementation detail that we shouldn't have been replying upon) for the jest changelog to perhaps mention the change many thanks :-)
expected `jest` to be defined, but it 's undefined.
expected jest to look like this: phofcode
in the sample files, when jest app.test.js is run i expect "new foo" to be printed.
however, "original foo" is printed instead.
note that if the import in app.js is changed to const m = require( './module '); and the function is called with m.foo(), then everything works as expected.
this kind of a blocking issue since the world moving toward destructured imports for everything.
jest behaves the same in all versions of node.
jest should make that test fail and continue with the rest, eventually finishing
jest should run my tests.
* the file paths in the coverage report should reflect working directory where the jest test was ran from.
* rootdir should be set to the project root in the current working directory path (not location of source folder drive is mapped from.)
the stored snapshot would be the string `"wibble wibble"`.
instead, it is stored -- and matched -- as an object like this: exports[`basic should match: base 1`] = ` object { "0": "w", "1": "i", "10": "b", "11": "l", "12": "e", "2": "b", "3": "b", "4": "l", "5": "e", "6": " ", "7": "w", "8": "i", "9": "b", } `; note that during testing, when there is a snapshot mismatch, even in the string, the reverse happens.
a simple string like `"wobble wobble"` shows as an object, with characters out of order.
this is applied to the received value, making debugging with longer strings very hard.
`done()` finishes an async test immediately
here's a screenshot with jest at 24.1 image phofimage and here's running the same test suite with jest at master.
note that i built it with a console log to verify which console is being used.
expected the test run to succeed with exit code 0.
tests are running no matter where they are invoked from phofcode
i would expect all tests to run when typing `a`.
mapped module should be loaded without error
i want to be able to use coverage with my code based on `vm.runincontext`.
i expect jest to run tests.
it should be faster than this.
proper coverage report with the puppeteer evaluate code excluded.
otherwise some kind of configuration option to exclude remotely executed code.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
mockresolvedvalue() should be able to return an array
the diff output should only report non-matching fields as incorrect like in the example below.
i would have expect jest to succeed to distinguish 0 from 5e-324.
the following assertion should not fail: phofcode indeed `{a: undefined}` is not `{}`.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the expectation is to have much slighter increase in the number of packages in dependencies.
(i would expect only a few thousands maybe)
the style length of the child element (created in by setting innerhtml) should be 0: phofcode
- `yarn audit` does not report any issues related to phofurl
if a sync function is passed to `exampleconfig`, async functions should pass.
if an async function is passed to `exampleconfig`, sync functions should pass.
i expect to obtain notification when finished (appers, but long after finished), and a clean output with the coverage summary.
instead, i obtain the error message.
and when removing the notification option, i obtain a clean output, but no coverage summary (not sure if the missing summary is related, but both appear at same time).
this is output with __jest@24.1.0__, same error, and no coverage summary: screenshot 11 45 00 phofimage this is output with __jest@23.6.0__, same error, but with coverage summary: screenshot 11 34 24 phofimage this is output __jest@22.4.4__, no error and summary (but i needed to add `testurl: ' phofurl to config file to pass tests): screenshot 11 30 27 phofimage
maybe a list of what is called with?
something like the failure output for the tobecalled() matcher
i would expect the component name in the snapshot to be something like `<memo(componentname)>`.
i expect to be able to run them from intellij idea interface
each test file should take the same amount of memory (give or take)
tests to run as they did with babel 6/babel-jest 23.
i suppose it should still work as per documentation
expected the coverage data to be collected and put out to the console.
`testscheduler` should follow the order in projects.
after clicking the menu and choosing a section, the menu should close and we should be at that part of the page.
assertions inside synchronous subscribe should work.
this issue phofhyperlink doesn't help because the test is synchronous.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i would expect `jest-circus` and `jest-jasmine2` to run the same set of tests, unless this is an intentional difference :smile:
i would expect that mocked files do not bring any imports with them
i expect the promises returned by map to finish and log the values from the global object, the program to console.log "done", then to disconnect from mongoose.
the console.log( 'done ') never happens and promises never finish their console.logs.
all console.log 's outside of promises get printed, however (e.g.
console.log( 'checking: ' + collections)).
test coverage should be 100% due to having a test around resolves, await, and rejects.
if the async value is removed the coverage is 100%, but the function needs to be async for the .then() in it.
appears to be happening on all of our async functions.
test coverage should be 100% due to having a test around resolves, await, and rejects.
if the async value is removed the coverage is 100%, but the function needs to be async for the .then() in it.
i expect jest to either throw an error or warning saying that length of time is too long and then ignore my setting _or_ actually wait for
all the tests should pass.
while i would expect some overhead for module resolution.
i would not expect such a drastic difference in speeds.
if this is expected is it documented somewhere?
jest v24 running performance matches v23.
full coverage report by each components.
from the discussion in #7443, i guess that non enumerable symbolic properties were omitted from the snapshot to reduce the snapshot size and remove unimportant information.
however in case of enzyme, all the properties in shallow-ly wrapped component instance are non-enumerable props: phofurl -> phofurl as such, i'm unsure if you would like to consider this as a bug in jest or something that enzyme should be fixing.
jest ignores type info and any type-related keywords
it should always check that `element` or any other host object is defined before it is used - so the test above should be green.
i expect the files to be transformed correctly and for `babel-jest` not to throw an error.
behavior should be the same as running jest in the project 's dir, e.g.
you can reproduce the expected behavior using node@8.15. again, we expect a state change after awaiting an async function, and this time the function is awaited: phofcode
all existing tests should pass with `yarn jest --no-cache --runinband` .
expecting a coverage of my code but got the errors indicated and this file | % stmts | % branch | % funcs | % lines uncovered line #s all files 14.29 0 0 14.29 index.js 14.29 0 0 14.29 |... test suites: 1 passed, 1 total tests: 1 passed, 1 total snapshots: total time: 15.854s ran all test suites.
jest should either skip `beforeall` for the skipped test suites, or run `afterall` for all the skipped test suites.
i don 't get warned
it should start jest in watch mode.
the console output has a coverage summary that includes file test coverage data and "all files" aggregates that aren 't all 0
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
jest 24.0.0 should not be 67% slower than jest 23.6.0 for the same set of tests.
jest reads both `setupfilesafterenv` and from a preset.
link should point to phofurl
with a response header including multiple cookies (e.g.
"foo=bar" and "bar=foo"), expect the response object from `request` to have a header value for `set-cookie` to be an array of those cookies (e.g.
however with jest, the example header value would be `["foo=bar,bar=foo"]`.
i'd like the examples to work on my machine.
those two tests should be equivalent.
also, i found the error message a bit confusing: screen shot at 10 45 23 phofimage
in ts to solve this error you usually declare a global module for the global names: example phofcode but jest doesn't seem to pick those up.
it's expected that the documentation would contain instructions on how to handle this common situation
i would expect that the same module, when both statically and dynamically imported, is referentially equal, while preserving the intended behavior of `resetmodules`.
ci tests not to be so slow.
it should stop the calls to `shouldruntestsuite()` when the first plugin returns `false` or `promise<false>`.
since jest does not perform any checks related to typings, it makes sense to me that type information should be stripped (and other babel plugins should be applied) before mocks are hoisted.
as jest claims i reference an out-of-scope "variable" (actually a type), this does not seem to be the case.
to me (and @simenb, who looked at this after i gave up), this seems like a bug.
it should be lightning fast.
i would expect both outputs to be the same.
the library should be mocked with no issues.
jest either passes running my unit tests or it fails from running my unit tests.
(it currently fails from not running my unit tests)
`fetch-mock` (both the local and node_modules versions) should successfully mock `node-fetch` and be able to invoke the helper from the original implementation
the `json()` function is called twice.
the first time the line fails.
but because it is in a promise, it does not fail the test.
the execution is resumed in the `.catch` and the 'notok ', err});` is called.
all expects in second call of `res.json` are true so test pass.
in general if an `expect` fails, error should be logged and test needs to fail
i would expect the paths relative to the project folder.
a workaround is as follows phofcode
jest cache should depend on babel version and should be busted when babel version changes.
i have traced the file into `script_transformer.js`.
the code is not transpiled, despite the fact that `willtransform` equals true.
so `transformsource` is returning untransformed content: phofcode both `transformedsource.code` and `content` are the same.
i expect the result to be in es5, but it's not.
i expect that the return value defined in the module factory is kept even though i use `resetmocks`.
especially i expect that the factory function is called again at each test.
but maybe this is a wrong assertion...
this is the expected error message: phofcode
there should be no error.
both tests should pass or both tests should fail - design decision
i would expect the test to run.
i know i could use something like `.tothrow(err.message)` to pass it, but i want to check the error type also.
the script should echo (a) blank line(s), i.e.
the `jest` process should not maintain watches at all.
note that strictly speaking, i think this defective behavior still satisfies its behavior as documented in that the watched files still do not trigger a re-run of tests when updated, though i did not test this behavior.
`xmlserializer` should work as expected.
support for it was added to jsdom in v13 phofhyperlink .
jest should be able to produce a clean diff which identifies the asymmetric matcher as: but instead the `expect` package fails to build a diff and errors out with `typeerror: cannot convert a symbol value to a string`
i'd expect the invocationcallorder in the 2nd test to be [1] and [2].
it seems like the mock state is reset but not the counter, this means tests will only have expected callorders if they're first tests run in file.
it also means you can't run a single test as values will be different.
expect the tests to pass so tests can be run for multiple platforms
i expect my test to smoothly pass :)
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the above code is valid and works without issue when transformed by `babel-jest` without the `--watch` flag.
i expect it to work without issue with `--watch` set as well.
however, i currently get the following error from jest (which in turn doesn 't run, due to a non-existent file): phofcode this clearly means that `babel-jest` is not resolving the template string within the require, and is rather treating template string as a normal string.
when changing above code to following, `babel-jest` transforms without issue with `--watch` mode: phofcode
`.rejects.tothrow();` correct detects the thrown excection
the tests for the specified project should be executed with the project 's jest config, the way it would be executed if there were multiple projects.
as illustration shows, one would expect a proper error message to be displayed.
no error related to module loading
no errors i am using `package.json` phofcode relevant `.babelrc` file phofcode file used for jest transform inside "jest.config.json" phofcode
no errors i am using `package.json` phofcode relevant `.babelrc` file phofcode file used for jest transform inside "jest.config.json" phofcode
the test should be executed successfully.
coverage report should read like: coverage summary statements : 3.6% ( ) branches : 0.96% ( ) functions : 1.59% ( ) lines : 5.6% ( )
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it should work properly with react-navigation scrollview class.
to fail the test run when the threshold is not respected.
according to @mweststrate of mobx: `the problem is that it should ignore non-enumerable (symbolic) members.
it was fixed a while ago for toequal, but not yet for snapshots` link to mobx issue phofhyperlink
sidebar is shown on left side
i expect the last step above to acknowledge `src/index.js` has been deleted and subsequently run the `src/index.spec.js` file (due to the file `require`-ing it).
jest cli should run this test and output the testing result.
i expected to understand - [x] does `modulenamemapper` transformation happens before `transform`?
- [x] does `transform` runs on files matched by `modulenamemapper`?
- [x] does the order of the `transform` keys matter for the pattern matching?
if so - [x] does the file gets apply all matching transformers or just first matching as `modulenamemapper` works?
i expect to be able to run the projects just like if they were defined in a config file (which does work).
log message should be displayed before the program gets into infinite loop
the example on the official guide should be updated to latest one.
the provided path will be used for prettier.
i expect the default mock behavior to be restored after the test with the mockimplementationonce has completed.
jest will point to right line that caused error.
the tests should complete without error with the --coverage option enabled.
i expect all setupfiles to be sourced from the exact same location.
there shouldn 't be an infinite loop, or how can i avoid it?
i think `pretty-format` should fail the test with an informative message instead of letting the jest/node process die if the serialisation is about to fill the heap.
one way to do this could be to abort object serialisation when when test would otherwise time out.
it takes (much) longer than default test timeout of 5 seconds to run out of memory on my late 2013 macbook pro: phofcode
it should be rendered as an emoji :smile
2 different blobs instances are not eqaul.
the test should be able to include mixins as subclass
> note: testenvironment is sandboxed.
each test suite will trigger setup/teardown in their own testenvironment.
while using 23.5.0 repo, it determines the test and continues.
paste the results here: phofcode
* i expect the number of workers between normal runs and watch mode to be equal.
* i expect the cli doc for `--maxworkers` to reflect the actual defaults.
* i expect a run of all tests in watch mode vs normal runs to be much closer to each other in run time.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i think the proper behavior would be to tear down environments after a test file each test file is done and allow garbage collector to do it 's job.
the test is being executed without throwing an unexpected token.
the empty coverage for `brandtable.jsx` is incorrect.
jest should update code when after running with `--updatesnapshot` phofcode
excecpted jest to stop and return to my console.
as i am awaiting the submitform and in turn the authenticateasync is being awaited, i expect both of these to resolve before the rest of the code is executed.
however, onsuccessfulsigninspy is never called.
these tests passed with node.js 8.12.0 i have found a way to get these to pass: replace mockimplementation with: false});` therefore removing one of async methods.
forcing expectation to happen only have next process tick has occured.
test finish and script exits
per the docs phofhyperlink i was hoping to see in the console the snapshot options.
if i change one of the components for example, i dont see diff in console or option to update snapshot
`modulenamemapper` patterns should be applied to the * resolved * filepath, not the raw file path found in the source code: phofcode
global environment built-ins are not mutated as a side effect of mock generation
using the following `package.json`: phofcode phofcode using the following `package.json`: phofcode phofcode
my code coverage, on most files should be 100% in all categories.
it should keep the new line characters on the generated snapshot, something like this: phofcode
i would expect that the snapshot files that *just got written to* wouldn 't be considered instantly obsolete.
speculation: it looks like the custom snapshotresolver isn 't invoked when analyzing obsolete snapshots, so jest doesn 't know that these files were actually written to, or something else is weird.
debugger should be attached and tests executed.
no error should be thrown and a coverage report should be generated.
the test above should pass, since `process.domain` should be set to the actual domain object in which the code is being run.
see phofurl running the test in `mocha` + `chai` (with the relevant changes to test * only * - requiring `expect` from `chai` and changing matcher to `not.to.be.null`) results in a passing test.
`jest` should execute correctly when generating coverage with the `testregex` config param.
since it works with me manually running `yarn test` and it'll transpile and tests correctly, the other cases should do that aswell, i.e.
anything else than me running the jest command.
the test name pattern works the same with and without snapshot names
jest-worker using at least one worker in the default case.
i can get `env` value in `beforeall` hook and each `test` case.
but can not get `env` value in `describe` block.
as you can see the `stdout` - ` a - describe scope env: undefined` expect get `env` value in `describe` block.
per the setupfile documentation, i would expect the setupfile to run once per test, instead of once per test file.
instead it prints this error: phofcode
coverage report should be the same with or without the exclusion pattern.
i expect the tests to run and jest not to blow up when someone requires a .json file in some dependency 's random dependency without specifying the extension.
apparently some it is supposed to work...
it should log: - promise - timer - end this is because `runalltimers` should trigger the async promise handler first, then the timeout delayed by 100ms, then return control.
i would expect for the first test to pass and the second test to fail... because the mock should have been cleared.
i don't expect jest to re-run tests when only the access time changes.
i would expect it to re-run tests when the modified time changes or new files are added, etc.
both ** should ** produce the same snapshot, as writing it either way won 't fail the actual test(for `wrapper.text()`).
however the result shows that they produce different snapshots.
this should work with babel 7?
documented approaches such as: `const spy = jest.spyon(video, 'play');` would no longer work if this isn't resolved.
i would expect anything in test file would be executed after the globalsetup is resolved.
should not throw and expose a global `expect` object.
if you detect that there 's no `module` but a `window` instead, doing `window.expect = expect` makes everything work perfectly

see above for more details.
documentation exists that guides how to properly configure jest to address this use-case.
the `beforeall` block should run before a parameterized test, in order to match the behavior in non-parameterized tests.
i expect jest to use `babel-jest` and transform my local es6 module into a syntax it can understand.
the source code line phofcode should stay untouched.
tests should work as locally because all my snapshots are checked in the source control.
`this.expand` should work as intended.
i expect jest to work with babel 7.
the required module resolves and the test passes.
the above test should pass.
the test should pass as is does in jsdom environment or running the following code in node: phofcode
when i run my tests with the `--watch` flag, jest just hangs with the message: `determining test suites to run...` phofcode here is my `setuptests.js` file: phofcode
the jest documentation accurately describes the behavior of mock reset/restore functionality and what is or is not possible when mocking.
a pointer to the source and the message highlighted correctly.
no error should be thrown.
the environment should by default be already resolved, so that the `require` call in `jest-runner` would be a noop (i 'm not sure where this default configuration is set, but basically it should be `testenvironment ||= rather than `testenvironment ||=
i would expect the test to succeed because the second call matches the expectation.
if i use `tohavebeenlastcalled` in the previous code then test is green, so matching as such seems to be accurate.
function coverage should be 100%
test fails with `"done" called multiple times` or some such message
at step 10, jest should print a success message saying that all snapshots have been written.
phofcode - if you remove snapshot names `snapshot 1` and `snapshot 2` and go through the same steps above, jest will behave correctly at step 10.
- it seems to work if the test file `my.test.js` contains only one `test` block : phofcode
the file system is not crawled => faster test run.
the message should say e.g.
`since * commit/branch * `
the expected behavior is that the wrapper should look like below: phofcode note the " ** has-error ** " but using jest v22 (or later), with everything else the same, it looks like below: phofcode
test should pass, correct mocks should be cleared
the command should run all my tests.
expect the test to run.
when i down grade to babel 6.x it works as expected.
when i try to use babel 7, it fails.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when i run `npm t` i get the following error: phofcode
there should be no leakage in jest
the behavior should yield the same result as the local run with the same node and npm version, where it passes.
i expect not to get the above error message
a note in the contribution guide should tell me that before.
the second promise should be resolved after the second timer advance.
also both of them should be resolved if i call the `advancetimersbytime` function once with 20 ms param.
jest should be able to use `babel-jest` and transform es6 and process it.
no error throws with the second config.
the automock should work for []` or if it should not work for some reason the docs should be updated.
i expect the environment variables to persist.
debugger stops at line 2
i expected jest to run tests using the dynamic babel configuration without issue.
after running jest test, i do not receive a mock warning of duplicate errorutils.js, but a fail/pass of my tests.
i saw various issues that had similar problems, tried their solutions with no success.
phofcode a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
no open handles should be left.
a better error message, that points to the problem:
phofcode for the above to not throw an error
test should run for all elements loaded into the table after execution of `beforeall`
this repo phofhyperlink configures jest with two projects (one has `browser: true` and tests `*.browser.js` files and the other has `browser:false` and tests `*.node.js` files.
phofcode there are 22 tests (because more than 20 tests are required to trigger concurrent mode).
11 (named a.browser.js through k.browser.js) run in the browser project and look like this: phofcode 11 (named a.node.js through k.node.js) run in node project look like this: phofcode all should pass.
the window property should take the new defined value.
should install without issues the first time
a few options: - move babel-specific config logic from `jest-config` into `babel-jest`.
- adjust the way `jest-config` uses `babel-jest` to be a require wrapped in a `try/catch` with graceful fail logic.
- maybe move `babel-jest` to `peerdependencies`?
although, this isn't quite the correct use case for peer deps.
the filename should be displayed correctly.
**all properties added to the object are checked strictly** and not just `message`.
acceptance criteria: - phofurl **must fail** - phofurl **must pass**
not seeing this error message despite the test case passing.
the error should not happen.
no error should be thrown, since `setitem` is called during the test.
15 test to have said passed, but at least expecting 14 pass and 1 fail
my jest test: phofcode result: is always `/`.
note: typescript complains about `property 'jsdom ' does not exist on type 'global '.`
only one `<option>` element is present, so the test should fail with a message saying something along the lines of `expected <array of domfragments> to have length 2`
tests should show as failed, or at least have some sort of cleaner output.
i would expect the error message to say something along the lines of `describe expects <n> arguments to be utilised` or similar
the test files in `packages` should be transpiled
i expect both `jest` and `jest --coverage` to output similar results.
to open i18n page or english page.
test run without any message or warning.
but this is what i get : phofcode
hoping to fix so there is no leak.
this unfortunately is preventing us from moving to jest as we cannot run the suite on our memory bound ci (even with multiple workers to try to spread the leak).
i 'm hoping the reproduction is usefuli spent some time trying fix with some basic guesses at closures but ultimately am in over my head with the codebase.
you can see huge closure in memory analysis so i 'm inclined think it 's some closure capture over `require` implementation and/or jasmine async function (promise).
<img width="1390" alt="screen shot at 6 52 50 pm" src=" phofurl <img width="1504" alt="screen shot at 4 45 32 pm" src=" phofurl <img width="1390" alt="screen shot at 7 13 23 pm" src=" phofurl some leak suspects: * closures (section 4) phofhyperlink * wondering if this or other similar code in here is a closure capture that v8 can 't break phofurl * promises (async generator) leaking phofhyperlink * wondering if promise / asynctogenerator babel capturing scope with `next`, preventing it from releasing?
global data (section 1) phofhyperlink capturing too much global console?
these are educated guesses, but there are quite a few closures within runtime / runner / jasmine packages though so it 's very difficult (as least for me being new codebase) pinpoint where capture lies.
i 'm hoping that there 's a specific point and that each closure in runtime would not present same issue.
jest should be working with pnpm.
it should throw a error of threshold too, even if i put it inside the projects of jest configure.
it would ideally add a note about how it 's checking object identity and not key/value equality.
expect the `style.background` to be `grey`.
i expect the jest test to execute succesfully in the same way the mocha tests currently do.
the method should be available for spying.
data types should not change.
an appropriate error message that suggests that the problem is in the `aftereach` line so that as a developer i can know what went wrong and fix it, without manually guessing which of my 100 lines of test code is problematic.
the memory heap decreases after a jest
each config must be isolated; order of entries in `projects` should not change behavior
i'd like to be able to pass my tests
the test should pass and the extended class should be defined.
see typescript example to see it work.
running flow from the command line also works: phofcode
the code from a `beforeall` should not be executed when the describe it is part of is skipped.
it should show the diff between the expected and actual values.
mock function should return the inner function instead of `undefined`.
the package should be added.
it is expected to break on first line and in debugger statements or breakpoints
the test should fail and show the diff between the objects.
it should retry `n` times when `jest.retrytimes(n)` is set.
the test run should exit with an error message instead of continuing indefinitely.
additionally, it would be great with feedback on why the test failed via something like @simenb's pr phofurl
`require.cache` should not be affected, e.g.
above module when run directly via node.js will log _module_ instance.
i would expect that since projects can specify resolvers per project, that jest would not cache between them i will try working on a pr since this is a feature i need.
in our codebase we compile multiple variants of our app and we use a string in the import statements to differentiate between the apps.
i want to make it so that spec.a.js and spec.b.js resolve with preference to .a.
respectively.. and apart from this hurdle it seems to work.
run coverage after the test suites, every time.
observable in node v6: phofcode
jest tests should run properly.
would expect the ts files to be covered by `jest --coverage`
i would expect no duplicate files in coverage
every file inside `src` should be reported on `jest --coverage`
jest and codepen example should behave the same way in regard to selectors.
the original snapshot on disk should be deleted.
when jest is run the second time, the previous cache entries are not re-used, and the changed babel config is seen in the results.
--- i'll open a pr to update `getcachekey()`: phofurl
jest should report that the `beforeall()` failed, and bail phofhyperlink the `describe` scope without executing further tests in it.
if it's somehow intended behavior that all tests should still be execute, and still marked as failed (which i find odd), this should be documented under `beforeall` phofhyperlink and in the setup and teardown guide phofhyperlink .
other tests in the file, outside of failing block, should still be executed.
running tests through jest should ideally be as fast as running them through jasmine.
the test suite should fail, like it does if the error were thrown in a top-level `afterall`.
the message should be clear that `testpathignorepatterns` is causing files to be ignored.
also i suggest mentioning either that testpathignorepatterns can match the parent folder and/or that `<rootdir>` can avoid that problem.
also, why does jest print `pattern: - 0 matches`?
**suggested output:** no tests found in c: dev ignored 2 files checked.
testmatch: ** /__tests__/ ** / * .js?
(x), ** - 1 match testpathignorepatterns: ignore.
* - 1 ignored caution: testpathignorepatterns does not begin with <rootdir> so it is potentially matched against the name of a parent directory.
either match on the name as well as the message, or strip out the name from the test failure report
my tests should run properly.
the passed in object should not be mutated.
i would expect debugging to work with --watch
with jest `22.4.4` (or above) in the `package.json` file, `docker-compose run test` should find test files and run them.
if the error does not occur, the output is "no tests found"
expect the mock to continue to work and not reset during test run.
test coverage should not contain test files
running `jest` should be able to run the test, which includes an `import` statement.
the `babel-node` command of the minimal repo executes the import successfully.
it should work in both the scenarios.
jest should fail on obsolete snapshots and remove them with `jest -u`.
we expect the alternate syntax for file type to be allowed.
any in the worker should be visible at the end and not cause the whole test to fail.
it should pass the behavior should be the same as using phofcode
i wouldn 't expect to see open handles for `require()` calls
the test runner doesn 't crash # actual behavior phofcode
even if it sounds weird to expect a date to be invalid, it shouldn't fail to create a snapshot with an invalid one.
it should serialize it as `invalid-date` for example ( ** not ** `nan` since we need to know that it's a date type in the snapshot).
as an example of use, i experienced this while creating tests for a serializer/deserializer where i needed save and restore invalid dates...
the previous behavior should be restored.
the error message thrown by the class method should be thrown
link should land on phofurl
the first test should fail with a timeout error.
the second test should pass.
i expect the test report to give the real argument the mock was called with.
test.each() should run tests by passed cases.
under 23.1.0, it finds test files.
under 23.2.0, it does not.
`jest_worker_id` should increment with each test suite.
import should work as expected.
i would expect the spy on method to track accurately track the amount of times a method is called, regardless of where it is invoked throughout the application.
the links should redirect to the webpage they refer to.
for `"testnamepattern": "$a"` phofcode for `"testnamepattern": "suite a"` phofcode
i only wanted to specify `snapshotname`.
the docs say it 's the second argument: phofurl i have no idea what "property matchers" are and am not currently interested in them.
(the docs fail to mention their format.)
i passed `null` because i don 't know what their default value is (the docs fail to mention that too).
couldn 't figure out for quite some time why my tests were failing.
expected `null` to be treated as a "missing" value for `propertymatchers` instead of trying treat it as some kind of a shape.
test files should be found.
error objects with custom fields should be deep checked.
it should be able to execute tests.
btw should not this be covered in tests to avoid bad publish builds?
or is there something else i am missing?
jest should run the tests without any `babel` transpile failures.
once the test-results have been written to the output file, the runner should load and interpret it.
currently the runner assumes filename, so it might as well use a file-watcher as a primary method to detect completion of tests.
tests to succeed (which is happening now) and coverage to be 100% everywhere.
it should show only the matches that truly failed.
the result should be the same with both implementations.
tests found and executed like in 23.1.0
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
expect lines `4` and `7` to be listed as "uncovered" (either red or yellow).
since we have this kind of behavior with uncovered single line branches (e.g.
: uncovered ternary expression conditions or default params), i would expect those lines to be listed as uncovered as well.
> ** note: ** the `% funcs` is reported correctly (25%).
all test should pass with or without coverage .
problem is at when jest applies the babel-plugin-istanbul parseropts options need to be `strictmode : false`.
i found it through stack trace if you add phofcode at all tests will pass with or without coverage.
i would expect this to not throw an error.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the test should be marked as failed.
i don 't get linked to a 404 page by both google and phofurl
jest's code coverage reporting, when using the multi-project runner, should be identical, regardless of whether caching or run-in-band is enabled or disabled.
phofcode is not obsoleted (it 's convenient to use --testnamepattern to update snapshot only for single test block)
using this.result should not make tests fail.
if in the event there is failure, it should say why exactly it is failing - in this case, it should say this.result object is a reserved object, that cannot be used.
i expect the default jest test included with create-react-app will run without error.
manual mocks should allow json files.
a single failed test is rerun.
i expect the jest to import the antd component like any other module and execute the tests on it.
i would expect that the global would remain defined through the entire test suite and allow chaining of its methods, as it does in the mocha and `jest-mocha-runner` environments.
expected the following snapshot to be generated: phofcode
the formatting of snapshots in each environments should match when using the same package.json for dependencies.
currently using: - "types/jest": "22.2.3", - "jest": "22.4.4", (sub-dependency to pretty-format "version": "22.4.3") - "jest-junit": "3.6.0", - "ts-jest": "22.4.3" but also tried updating to (with no change in result): "types/jest": "23.0.2", "jest": "23.1.0", "pretty-format": "23.0.1", "jest-junit": "5.0.0", "ts-jest": "22.4.6"
to see only test success message.
ability to import default export properly
i have a package that relies on process.on("exit") to clean up after itself.
i don 't want to have to replicate that behavior in teardown()
in a reporter, `testresult.console` should be populated for all test run scenarios (at least optionally).
with the steps above, `test.noop.js` **should not** be executed, but it is.
should pass; instead, fails with: phofcode
it should change component state like it works with regular timers phofcode
0 tests passed 0 tests failed 1 test skippe
the error stack should be correctly reported.
the expected urls (that work) should be: - phofurl - phofurl
v23 to skip test suites that have no tests in them that match the `-t` patter, rather than error.
coverage to stay consistent and not change for the files that are not changed.
i should see a `console.log()` with a string of the mongo uri in the output but i get `undefined` when running with phofcode
i expected this bare-bones babel config to have no effect on jest, and for jest to continue working as it did previously.
non-enumerable symbolic properties should be treated the same as non-enumerable non-symbolic properties when running `toequal`.
either both should be included, or excluded.
given that symbolic properties are lot more exotic, i think the behavior of string properties should be followed and non-enumerable symbolic should be excluded from deep equality.
i am willing to file a pr myself
i expect the function to be called and the test to pass.
when i test in the browser it works as expected.
passing tests as `jest --no-cache` provides.
before `23.0.0` a test that had no body would automatically be skipped and would not throw an error in the test report.
`jest` should pick up the file change for the transpiled js file and figure out that it corresponds to the source ts file which is tracked and modified in git.
it then should run the tests for that file.
test passes, writes a snapshot
expected jest to understand paths... i have a ngrx platform example app using jest and also using paths and they work fine, but they refer to librarires (@ngrx/effects instead of ../../ngrx/effects) for example.
the order in which tests run, running separately or all test suites should not influence the outcome of the tests.
- test should be runing
open the right link phofurl notice that it should end with a slash.
less proliferation of the inconvenience that is the backslash!
expect to have successfull test
jest should catch the stat error and, seeing that it 's for an "uninteresting" path, continue with normal operations
notifications are only shown when tests are run * jest 23.1.0 * node 8.11.2 * macos 10.13.
`--projects` should work with the specified projects config and only run the projects with the display names given to the option.
jest tests to work even though the package name has a `:` in its name.
the expected behavior is that this would produce an informative error about the substring being contained within the "how are you?"
string when it is expected not to be.
snapshots should look the same as in in jest 22
the objects should be equal to each other
i would expect the coverage output to appear as normal and not produce a syntax error.
tests without a callback are marked as "pending" and do not throw errors.
--- we very, very commonly write out test cases before implementing the tests.
these serve as reminders, or as a plan, of what the functional code we are going to write should actually do.
with the latest changes in jest 23, all of these throw errors now and our test suite fails.
please revert this change or make this behavior toggleable
when dealing with a typed array, that array's `buffer` property should always be `instanceof arraybuffer`.
the test runs during coverage collection should use the `displayname` set by the babel plugin.
the test should pass, adding the code block is, by documentation, intended to simulate a node environment, where neither `window` nor `document` should be defined: phofcode
when babel-jest is used to transpile es-modules using packages like lodash-es it should transpile the imports to commonjs so they work with jest.
practically i believe it should be sufficient to add to the plugins list that `babel-jest` uses when the filename is a `node_modules` file and babel 7 is used.
this would also fix the fact that it 's not good practice for project 's `.babelrc` (which may also include plugins for non-standard things like jsx and flow) be used just transpile es6 / modules code in packages.
it should be added to line coverage.
i created a new constants namespace for my repo.
configuration loading works even if `projects` is set to only a single project phofcode
i expected jest to update the failed snapshots from the previous run.
no syntax error should be thrown from adding newlines.
the idea that globalsetup runs before "everything" is not practical.
setup will generally require some configuration options for things to work.
the tests should be passed and `m` module should be `123` which set by `domock`.
because the `m` module is not `123`.
- `f` should always map "to only run failed tests."
- `a` should always map "to run all tests."
jest should return an error leading user to the right direction, instead of saying "no tests found" and exist with 1. most user will likely start to adjust `testmatch` or `testregex` which is the wrong direction of debugging.
`process.env` should be recreated for each project with `process.cwd()` set as `rootdir` for that particular project.
a simple and clear error like "no tests found", or simply skipping coverage, or coverage report as usual (and failed 100%).
sort order does not matter.
they should be consistent with one another
it should be ignored or logged instead of crashing
if `interface fastifyerror extends errnoexception` then we needn't cast error.
expect the fastify server to accept all requests, no matter how long the server has been running already.
i wouldn 't expect a 404. with a plain server, the url is: phofcode phofcode
the server should start, console output should appear.
paste the results here: nothing!
i would like the result to be the detailed contents... phofcode
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
paste the results here: phofcode
the route should register and resolve references correctly.
paste the results here: phofcode
it should work the same way both ways, especially with fastify's default options.
otherwise, it should be documented that it only works with the default instance of ajv.
paste the results here: phofcode
the response is sent successfully so i 'd not expect any errors here, especially a 404. paste the results here: phofcode
i expected to be able to use `fastify.register` inside the after function without exception on the 2.x series of fastify.
the exception result is listed below.
no warning printed at all
the handler should not get called.
i would expect that fastify loads the plugins as expected but will continue to allow route registration until `listen` is called.
i expected that the error logs should be the same but, they are different phofcode
`curl -l localhost:3000` 2. the handler for the `/` route should not be called.
child should be present in type logger.
expecting this ** would ** work: phofcode fyi: i want to use the same object schema for body and response.
expected parse the `hello` to [item]
`schema.query` to work as `schema.querystring`.
the request body in the logs: phofcode
the error should propagate to custom `errorhandler` and respond with 401 in this case.
avvio must stop loading the plugin and throwing `assertionerror [err_assertion]: method 'get' already declared for route '/v1/attendances/'` error.
adding the defaults to `routeoptions` the error goes away.
i think this is the desirable behavior.
paste the results here: phofcode
on aws lambda plugins should as expected.
i expect `fastify` to not mutate the data i put into it, especially when the subject are json schema definitions (as one would most probably like to reuse them as much as possible).
it should not crash paste the results here: phofcode
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
paste the results here: phofcode
i've expected throwing is `async` and normal functions to work the same way - i.e.
passing the error to `seterrorhandler` function and not crashing the app.
the console should output: phofcode what happens instead: phofcode
the response should contain the remoteaddress.
for prehandler1, i would expect to see "abc" returned as a reply.
i looked at the async hook unit tests and they check for reply.send and throw, but i don 't see any async hooks tests that check for return at all.
i don 't think am doing anything unexpected, so hopefully just a bug that can be squashed quickly.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
paste the results here: phofcode
npm package only contains the files to support runtime and development time (like *.d.ts).
unrelated files should not be published.
i expect to get in my fastify route request from `/users/4abc2` a `request.param.id` to be `{}` instead of `{id: '4abc2 '}` paste the results here: phofcode
error message implies that the default 404 handler should deal with it.
not sure if it 's a bug but it seems we should have multiple header entries for each cookie if we are calling reply.header multiple times for setting the cookies.
more details are given in this link.
phofurl this may fix the issue.
i don 't expect the thrown 's error.
the `$schema` is raccomended by the standard phofhyperlink so, maybe i 'm missing something or this field should be ignored?
if i remove the `$schema` field, all is working: phofcode
`get /abc/` should work and return `{ result: 1 }`
i expect that: - fastify returns a server error automatically, on validation error.
or - sent isn 't set to true until the response i really sent
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
paste the results here: phofcode
opening `/prefixed/bar` should work, but only `/bar` works.
we expect the icons to appear and look consistent across all browsers.
how would you like this to work instead?
i would expected the fontawesome pro to be found in the npm registry and be installed.
to not 404 and let me install my dependency
the mentioned icons should be colored with only one color, or have a totally different approach, for example like pause phofhyperlink .
a different argument is inconsistency with other mathematic symbols that are not bicolored.
how would you like this to work instead?
both font icon and svg sprite should be the same size.
how would you like this to work instead?
i would expect the unicode to work, but be able to type words
a tooltip based on an existing title element would appear when hovering over the fontawesome icon using all major browsers, including internet explorer.
the "hand peace" sign should have the palm face the viewer instead.
license declaration for package and actual license text should match.
i 'd like to see the same thing like in the example.
the facebook and google icon should be visible.
for all other icon classes (.fa, .fas, .far ...) there is a margin-left / -right of .3em.
the "fa-calculator" icon should have the same svg viewbox in solid and duotone sets.
how would you like this to work instead?
i guess this happens because shadow dom isn't affected by external css files, such as using external files is also discouraged by litelement guidelines phofhyperlink .
a correct approach would be providing a css module to be imported and included in the custom elements styles, e.g.
phofcode and then js static get styles() { return [ styles, // <- imported from fontawesome-svg-core css` :host { display: flex; } ` ]; } ``
i expect to see the duotone icon to replace the standard ul bullet point.
should be like in the gallery: phofurl
the icon should point to the top.
explanation in readme or a guide "how to use fa in amp pages"
how would you like this to work instead?
i need the circular version of the facebook logo as shown on the website.
works fine in chrome: image phofimage works fine if getting rid of the second resource loaded with subresource integrity check: image phofimage
all the icons should work.
fa should load just the font version i 've specified.
could be something like "error: you 're missing this element on your page"
i expect to be able to submit my lessons and have them counted toward my certification
the background colour should cover the icon perfectly.
image phofimage i added the following styles and it came out like what you see above.
when a text is selected or the editor has multiple cursors, pressing esc should only deselect or exit the multi cursor mode and not exit to navigation mode.
add success message in addition to color change on success state, or add common semantic icon such as green check icon beside the label.
for `new email` field in `email settings`, error state should be triggered instead of warning state.
there should only be two states for an email address.
success state is when it is a valid and reachable email address.
error state is when it is an invalid and unreachable email address.
for all fields in `your internet presence`.
success state when it a valid and reachable url.
error when it an invalid and unreachable url.
i think it should always look like a button, since clicking on it modifies the page rather than takes you to a new one.
the border should fit with the current colour scheme.
the code blocks in the output should be the same as the suite.
it should direct me back to freecodecamp.org.
expected behavior: print the values entered in the form element.
i should be able to scroll challenge description with keyboard navigation (up and down keys).
this should only happen when the text field is not in focus.
the description should wrap at the boundary of div.
it should solve the current challenge and present the following one.
the url should direct me to this rep
the modal should be closed every time you leave a challenge.
response with user data should be returned.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i expected to accept the my changing in a code by github.
that the markdown gets parsed the second way.
namely backticks become `<code>` tags and an empty line is needed to start a new paragraph
i expect the 'go to the coding curriculum' button to redirect me to learn.freecodecamp.org
previously this code was saved and you could check your work to help with future problems.
if you log out, this is still the behavior you get but then you obviously can 't save long term progress or completion.
seeing the page for "open source for goods" projects - which i can see at this link: phofurl (sorry for the title, that was typo and can 't change it
expected to be signed in to my old account.
typing "e" in the search bar should input an "e" into the search string while maintaining focus on the search bar.
you should see the certificate if you have it or be redirected to settings and informed `looks like user developmentuser is not responsive web design certified` if you don't.
should maybe reject any non-codepen/github links?
i know individual project checking is not done, but at least this adds a bit of integrity to these 'final projects '.
there should not be any white space and the green should transition straight to dark grey.
(unless this is a design choice, but i don't think so as the same white space is not visible on other pages.)
i expected the dark theme to load as usual with a dark grey background, but it fails to load or the color of the background is wrong.
when zoom is at 100%, we should be able to see the most recent progress.
i would expect a search page populated with relevant results to what i typed into the search bar.
the typed in text should still be in the search bar.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
in editor challenges, the shortcut works for phofcode (on a mac), which is preferred and acceptable in non-editor challenges, the shortcut works for actually phofcode (mac) at the congratulatory dialog box, both * ctrl * and * cmd * shortcuts work by convention shortcuts with windows' ctrl maps to mac's cmd.
no errors are supposed to show, it is supposed to load and when i go to phofurl the fcc curriculum should show.
should throw an error or should not render invalid code
this should be tackled as chrome appends "/" by default to any domain url you copy, so people who would copy url from search bars will get urls appended with "/" hence producing wrong results.
1. the line number should display well.
2. the code select should works fine.
navigating to any new page should leave the main nav menu closed or close it if it was open.
all the tests pass since i didnt change anything in the code
* search results should come under the search bar * width should be same or less than the search bar.
(disabling position: absolute; works but breaks in full search bar)
expected to see my progress on the heat map
in step 3, the browser should reload, mirroring the changed markdown.
according to the guide, i should be able to visit both phofurl and phofurl however, i'm only able to see the client side and nothing loads on port 3000.
the page should not scroll down when loading.
the scrollbar should go away when not needed.
once we get to the phofurl site and press enter, we expect the query to remain and receive a list of results instead of a blank.
the query should not have any trailing quotation marks.
the button should expand appropriately and text should not overflow
the test suite should run
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
to be signed into curriculum when you are signed into the rest of fcc.
test should pass with correct solution
it would be good to test the submitted solution to insure that it is realy the expected one.
it should return instead it returns 'undefined'.
i've tested it on both chrome (official build) (64-bit) and firefox 64.0 (64-bit)
1. when i change my username, save it, and then switch on night mode, a theme should change to dark, night mode "on" state should be active and night mode "off" state should be inactive.
2. when i am using dark mode, i change my username and then switch off night mode, the theme should change to bright, mode "on" state be inactive and mode "off" state be active.
we should have only one username per email address
the code should finish running: `async` and `await` should be supported.
in fact, it is the babel transform that is causing the problem.
the above would run in most modern browsers.
no error should appear and i assume redirect to `localhost:8000` should happen
recieved should be spelled received
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i would expect something like "attempted to modify immutable string object" in the output of console, rather than a silent failure
showing brackets in the console.
the separator should be clicked very easy.
second, third, and fourth paragraphs need ending quotes.
pr should pass all the builds to allow qas to merge prs to repo.
there shouldn't be a horizontal scroll bar and site width should be reduce
the search auto-complete dropdown should be displayed properly
button should be fully readable.
the heat map should render properly, displaying three blocks of different colors (as of writing this issue) instead of being empty.
since we dont need to sign up or sign in to view faq page and it is very helpful for beginners, it 's better to also put it directly on the homepage of freecodecamp website so that people can see it easily.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it seems like typeahead should work on the learn platform to avoid opening a series of tabs.
also, pressing return on a query on the search platform should probably just do nothing, instead of clearing your typeahead results.
- the correct url is: phofurl - the url linked to the search result is: phofurl from several searches that i've done, it seems like this problem is true for every single item within the coding interview prep section of the curriculum.
it seems that when the urls changed, they were not properly re-indexed for search.
filename should be truncated to match the length restrictions on ms windows.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the screen reader mode should have stayed enabled across lessons.
i expected the pull request title to be escaped and the request to be handled like any other pull request would be.
i think that the 404 web pages should not update the `redirect_to` cookie.
while logged out, i think that 404 should not be redirected to login page.
the `redirect_to` cookie should only get values from actual gogs web interfaces.
the pr creation screen should appear and default to the repo 's default branch, even if it 's not named master.
have an init script for entware supported systems.
delivery should happen to the given url.
an image link should appear in the markdown.
for example, if the markdown were: phofcode i would expect this to produce the same structure as github: phofcode
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i expect to be able to push or pull.
repositories should be pulled with no error.
gogs works fine and i can access my repository created before in the last container since i keep the /root/gogs volume
it should not exist, as it can cause security issue
expected both http:// to https:// change and port :3000 to :<customport> change to stick after install, neither did.
see middle section of screenshots in #1415 / #1416
a new pr is created.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when network connectivity is lost and then regain, gogs should rebind itself to it's ports.
expect gogs to read the correct config path provided by the arg `--config`
installation should occur with no errors.
being able to login again after 1st login.
a list of the repositories of the given user.
both should have width of 150px.
result is that relative path doesn 't.

- gogs version (or commit ref): v0.11.86 - git version: - operating system: k8s - database (replace `[ ]` with `[x]`): [x] postgresql
the auth source should be set to local after the 200 response
repo and organization creation - gogs version: - git version: 2.11.0 - operating system: raspi2_armv6 - database (replace `[ ]` with `[x]`):
pr redirect to repository a
instead of the error above, the repository should be checked out.
no error message as it 's a valid email address.
imo, if the gogs admin user wants to enter complete gibberish into the email address field for a manually created account, so be it.
it 's their install and that decision and its consequences are on them.
an option to disable the email address field validation, especially when registration is disabled in the config, would be quite useful.
any use of the token should be reflected in the tokens last used timestamp.
the server should check when someone is uploading orphans attachment (attachments not bounded to a valid repository and release) and refuse to save files for invalid repositories/releases and for unauthenticated users
i would expect some "your registration was successful with new record in user table.
a 202 http status is returned
i would expect after removing the file, updating the history, and force pushing to the phofcode branch, that gogs would acknowledge the changes made.
gogs should update repo size (unless i 'm missing something crucial, which is highly possible.)
packager.io builds should have the same feature set as binary builds
list collaborator api can retrun permission information
not auto-scroll at first cell.

the text field should become active, and a toolbar should appear above the keyboard.
user message content should not shown up on the keyboard untill user sets .onetimecode to the textfield
focus should go into textfields that are into nested stack views ### versions
it should move to the next field.
the keyboard should not flash down from the top of the screen, ever.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
this odd gap must not be there.
black screen will not be there and my view goes up inside the navigation bar which will not happen
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
collectionviewcell need to move down to previous place.
next/previous button can't work correctly
tool should never leak memory.
this causes the app to crash over prolonged usage.
ui should go back from the top to the original position.
it should show toolbar done button and focus the selected textfield point ### versions
at a minimum it shouldn 't say button twice.
apple 's apps also don 't seem to mention toolbars.
so i 'd recommend these labels become "previous", "next", "title", and "done" respectively.
when iqkeyboardmanager is disabled, the top of the uitableview remains pinned to the bottom of the uisearchbar / uinavigationbar.
this behavior should be consistent with iqkeyboardmanager enabled.
in this sort of view, it is not necessary to specify layout constraints manually.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
expect spacing to be like it was in 5.0.8
i would expect the kb to dismiss and stay dismissed.
based on the debug showlog(), it appears that the kb is hidden (dismissed?)
the search bar should stay at the top of the view until the user dismisses it with a 'done' or similar.
empty spaces should not appear.
alertcontroller will be shown ### versions
the keyboard should come all the way up and the screen scroll upward.
done button should display in the toolbar
the safe area insets should be unchanged in this case, so the view doesn't snap under the notch.
showing and dismissing keyboard leaving no black screen.
the whole view should be keep below the bottom base line navigation bar.
this should not be happen ideally.
last textfield should have a blue "done" button or for our german keyboard "fertig".
expected for the uicollectionview or its container to shift vertically to make room for the keyboard so that the uitextfield would be shown while editing
keyboard accessory show as well.
i expected the view to offset such that the cursor would be visible above the keyboard and would then scroll and/or offset to keep the cursor in view as i type.
the output field returns the complete curl command with " " within the csr field, so i can copy the complete command and rerun it anywhere else.
same behavior, regardless how the option is passed to vault.
working: phofcode not working: phofcode
i expect the metrics to be seen in prometheus format when `format=prometheus` is specified
nvda announces auth method dropdown changes.
i expect that the template functionality in vault agent would use the same ca cert that vault agent uses.
token created from the aws iam role should have the policy applied and be able to access data as per policy in a similar manner to `userpass`.
there should be two rendered templates: * * `/tmp/agent/render-user` only one of the two will render (it seems to be random which gets rendered).
the vault container should behave in a way where it identifies the region according to getordefaultregion phofurl
login into the ui should succeed
i was able to get this to succeed by using the same password without an exclamation point on the end.
unfortunately, i do not have a say what this password should be, so it must support special characters.
no debug info in vault agent logs
vault agent should continue executing the template without errors and pod failure.
i 'd like to be able to delete this entry somehow.
redirect uri should be set to `callback.example.com`
vault should present the new certificate after a `sighup` reload, as specified in the documentation regarding the [tls_cert_file and tls_key_file options][doc].
i expect the data to be written to vault and i get a success message.
i 'd expect all credentials to be revoked but maximum revoke attempts will be reached leaving plenty of dangling sql users and vault leases
either adding an auth backend should correctly trim the path or prepending the auth backend name with `%20` should disable the backend correctly
root should be signed using the correct algorithm for the configured private key.
in the example above, the ec root should be cross-signed with vault root 's rsa key and
the login should be successful and all groups should be returned in the query response so authentication will succeed.
the build should pass with no issues.
the page should 'move down' to respective chapter
able to log in with ldap
latest version of the secret should be visible
be able to run vault agent as a windows service like in case of consul: phofcode
i should have permissions to all vhosts under '/ ' so i would expect tosee output like the following: phofcode
vault server works without any panic errors.
there could be error but it should be back online soon
both vault cli and web ui should allow users to create their own secrets in the shared environment while not being able to see each others secrets or pathing.
have a valid signed certificates starting from the current system date
add <:lease_id> to documentation for the `/sys/leases/revoke` command as optional to make clear it can be used.
the 'vault server' command exits with a non-zero exit code.
expect the password to rotate once the ttl reaches 0.
`my_file.file` should * only * contain dataa, just like it does when vault outputs to stdout
an error explaining that `-key-shares=0` makes no sense
vault should unseal and initialise as per the documentation.
the new token should have the policies attached.
the workaround is to assign `policy`instead of `token_policy` and ignore the deprecation warning.
[info] log messages should be sent to `stdout` and not `stderr`.
all the keypairs in the key to be output on screen
the role is created (quickly).
k8s auth backend should get created.
as i understand the tidy operation must be running automatically and delete the revoked certificates and tokens.
`cat payload.json { "safety_buffer": "48h", "tidy_revoked_certs": true, "tidy_cert_store": true }` `curl --header "x-vault-token: $vault_token" --request post --data @payload.json phofurl
vault read and vault kv get works on approle ids this effectively translates to reads on working with a policy that gives access to that path.
should use the region from the configured endpoint (or us-east-1 if not configured?)
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
vault cli commands to work without certificate signing errors.
if everything else is in place - eg vault server has aws credentials, role exists in vault, iam role of instance configured for access to the role, login should succeed
expect token to be printed completely
vault on hitting an error, should have recovered and continued to provide other services.
the root login or any entity logged in at same time with the allowed permissions should be able to see this policy the entity has created without refreshing manually.
other users of a group could be working at same time using the web ui.
i expected the keys to be copied to the destination backend.
1) should be connected to gcp account via proxy and service account gets created
expected all operations after enabling the audit device to generate log files.
they are all logged, except the `vault operator unseal` succesful command.
the operation `vault opeartion unseal` with a wrong unseal key generates an audit log.
token renewal should work without side effects.
that prometheus metrics should be returned.
expect to see the self-signed ca added to vault pki enabled mount path
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i expected setting the boolean query parameter to false to result in the behavior reflecting it be false, not true.
the call should be successful and does not hang.
lines of text should not wrap unexpectedly
swagger specifications match the api docs
either the vault cli command should run the agent without the `auto_auth` option being provided, or the documentation should state that `auto_auth` option is not optional.
i should be able to log in via this enpoint as in previous version 1.0.3
shows configuration for that approle / allows login via approle.
i expect it to trust the unknown authority and join the cluster
i suppose that the pgp form part should not disappear and the pgp key be taken in account for initialization.
vault should have started successfully and further operations should have been successful.
should return the secret as array
the endpoint should return counter data, instead it returns 500 because the request can 't be audited.
i expect the vault to unseal.
if any keys are invalid, i would either expect _all_ of them to be invalid or _none_ of them: i initialize, seal and unseal using a number of shell scripts, have done so many times in e.g.
the last six months, this used to work until a couple of weeks ago; the issue occurs for the first time today, with new versions v1.1.5 and v.1.2.0.
i am reasonably certain there are no copy & paste or other trivial errors involved.
the failover should work as expected without corrupting the acls
vault would work normally as expected the client 's ip (instead of loadbalancer ip) would be visible in the vault audit logs
the form input used to be multi-line (or file selection?
), which allowed multi-line input.
this allowed the certificate data to save properly.
vault binary installed in $gobin
explanation of what active/standby high availability means in the world of vault, especially when using non-consul backends.
the documentation is very vague and does not discuss why this is useful or define the terms within the document.
the above redirect_uri should reference the remote server `<vault ip>` , the intended behavior is that the browser is redirected back to vault, not localhost.
service should be able to handle and not crash with 503 error
if a token has permissions to list the entities in vault, the ui should (1) display the "entities" entry in the sidebar navigation for "access" and (2) display list of entities when "entities" page is active.
be able to unseal vault after init.
vault should successfully init and automatically unseal.
secrets path should be enabled by default
go get successfully retrieves the vault go module
api call should return the entity
vault should return "204 no content" when providing a dash in the end of the key.
authentication should happen - token returned.
vault should not get sealed.
when reading a single k/v secret and auditing to the `/dev/null` device, i expect to see relatively high cpu utilization and high throughput of requests served.
under this configuration however, it is not possible to exceed around 30% cpu utilization on our hardware.
i think the client_secret should be able to be retrieved.
vault should start up and should be able to retried data from backend etcd storage.
when a new consul leader is elected the alive vault should be able to reply to request.
the `nuclear-reactor` policy should be visible in the ui against the entity with corresponding okta alias `user1`.
signed cert ttl should be what you set previously.
the error response url should be not malformed.
standby node become active shortly after active node is down.
the response suggested by the documentation
unseal keys retrieved from backup
ability to use postgresql 11 as a storage backend.
i also expect the storage documentation to list what versions of the storage applications are working/supported.
the full configuration options should be available via the web interface similar to the cli for users who prefer that or want to learn the product easier.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
vault should get unsealed when integrated with aws-kms.
`entity_id` field is included in the output of the `vault write --format=json auth/approle/login ...` too.
should not getting the error, instead of, should list the created secret name.
either vault should delete empty folders so they won 't get listed beforehand or executing the list command on an empty folder should give an empty answer, stating that there is no item in it.
standby servers should provide their own metrics instead of forwarding the metrics call to active server.
this would make more sense from monitoring perspective.
`go get` should get the dependencies and throw no errors.
`vault kv list kv/mydir` should list the keys in the directory when pointing to a vault agent
according to the api docs phofurl there is no way to update just a value, so maybe vault performs two requests when calling the vault kv patch, one for reading and one for updating.. anyways the generated command
i would expect to see an empty json object: phofcode
roles can be definied universally and assigned to all database or selected database after role creation statement and previus the database creation statement
1. vault must always fail creation of duplicated secret engine mounts at same path.
even if the secret engine delete operation failed and is leaving inconsistent mount points.
2. terraform pki secret engine destroy must fail if vault delete operation is not successful (this could also be a bug in the terraform vault provider).
my postgresql allows me symbol `#` in password.
i spent a lot of time finding what exactly broken my config :)
expect to be issued a token
query parameters should be supported by the agent.
after receiving a request from a non-whitelisted ip, vault should continue accepting http requests from whitelisted ips.
i would expect the token to be renewed or an error to be presented.
trim leading/trailing whitespaces in keys.
if this is not desired, consider to alert the user in the web ui in such cases.
also consider to alert the user if there are leading/trailing whitespaces in the corresponding value.
however, trimming value may not be beneficial (in general, modifying/normalizing passwords automatically is a bad idea).
approle logins should always work even during background tidy up processes.
an approach that works around the current race condition but doesn 't require locking during the entire cleanup process can be seen in my pull request #6252
i expect a better error message indicating the problem.
the message is about an enterprise feature of vault and misleading.
optionally, i would like to have this handled by the vault cli.
i want to make a * new * login, so the * previous * login should not play a role.
well, any valid path should be valid to store my ca.crt on.
the `key-shares` and `key-threshold` will be the same as i input, and the screen will show new key, just like documents: phofurl
wouldn 't expect to see the logs around no "tls config found", nor the gcs api errors around "connection reset by peer"
it appears to be a bug with postgres, would be nice to have an option to turn verify off to bypass check
graceful step down from old leader to a stable new one.
the api documentation to match the api ouput
see the content of the secret
this api endpoint should not hang and return 500 errors during a failover allowing services to authenticate with vault.
i would think a sane default would allow users to update their own passwords.
if there is a way to do this with policies, i 've been unable to determine how.
i have tried using something like the following, but it allows all users to update all other users ' passwords (expected, because of the wildcard).
also, seems the policy paths for userpass don 't support phofcode
the leader to be stable and change in response to a failed server or other unhealthy state.
policy with wildcard path should allow "read" secret-id-accessor as hardcoded does
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
we get a certificate with `tls web client authentication` extended usage with a cn value of `cn=foo,`
the preflight check should succeed.
either an updated documentation, or, preferably, to have the deprecated function removed from code.
being connected within the session of the token provided through the $vault_token environment variable when i execute _vault login_ or _vault login token=<different value than $vault_token>_ as described in warning message and documentation.
it is expected that the external group is populated with the user.
since the ttl has not passed as the configuration, vault is supposed to provide old password.
when wrapping is enabled, the cache should still work.
the above code would yield: phofcode
vault to respect the configured ttl values, the lease renewals and revoke leases only after the ttls expire.
vault should try to connect to the host pointed at by the `vault` host.
in our case this is resolved to private ip through consul.
instead, vault attempts to connect ` phofurl as indicated by the error message: phofcode
if `vault_namespace` is available to the running command it should be used without the need to call
i would expect the 1.1.0 version to honor the same env configuration as 1.0.3, and would expect any modifications to be present in the upgrade guide.
all upper case in `service_tags` should not been converted in low case.
vault should validate the string store it, and then it'll get passed along to the totplib unmodified.
the role should be deleted, and should see `success!
data deleted (if it existed) at: ssh/roles/everyone` on stdout
it should login success and return the access token
catch the empty (or otherwise non-printable) key in the list returned by list() and print a descriptive error to stdout and move on to the next key.
vault runs with mlock support and no warnings, whether using official hc binary or ports-compiled freebsd version.
ssh connection to the target server.
once `megakoresh@memes.co` logs in, they should have full access to `/sys/leases`.
users in the admin group can see and edit policies in the ui.
i expect stream redirection to redirect error output
the api should not fail, i suspect it is because the request result is not paginated, so the syslog size increases with time, making the api fail as well.
configuration from the ui and vault ci should result in identical configurations.
it should return a set of dynamic alicloud ram credentials
3. vault kv list 'secret/1 /' phofcode
the secret to be successfully created
the given method in api docs works.
engine should be configured with the shown 30 minutes default ttl or the menu should show 0 as a default.
i would like to see only headers i set, or default headers and headers i set.
i would like to have ability remove headers without delete cors config and set config
expected `refresh_interval` to appear in the cli output.
expected the same values in the output when using `-format=json` vs `format=table`
log into vault ui using okta and okta verify app - token should stay valid for it 's ttl and then request renewal and okta verify mfa prompt.
the test should pass since according to another existing test case phofhyperlink in the same test file, path should match if optionalparamregex is not present in the url.
similarly `a/b/foo` should also have matched the pattern `"a/b/" + genericnameregex("val") + with val capturing foo.
map the service account and read the password with ad read ad/credes/poc.test
sample output should reflect real output to assist in developing clients.
i would expect the `data` field in the response from `/decrypt/key` to look like: phofcode however, it actually looks like: phofcode
the usual response delivering the client_token, as is perfectly working when using iam without infering ec2 instances.
show the user his root token or recovery keys as normally.
appropriate groups should be returned
vault starts up and uses the database
setup postgres plugin at the mount path that was setup
displaying the object returned from the cli
user should have `users_metadata` policy assigned.
an array or indexed list of assigned policies
the client token written by the container to `/root/.vault-token` is reflected in the bind-mounted file `foo`.
if the there are errors during the root password rotation, everything should be rolled back and continue to work.
vault should start up successfull
the correct aws region should be detected from the ec2 instance profile.
the `list_secrets` should work as expected with the given policy and also since, `read_secret_version` seems to be functioning without any issues.
you should be able to edit anything under secret/devops
the renewable token must always stay the same.
both certificates should contain an `othername` field.
the parent token should not get a `permission denied` error for operations that its child tokens are allowed to perform.
configuration file include "port" property
temporary credentials may be passed in via the environment.
this is useful when testing vault on a desktop and using federated saml-based logins to aws.
1. token expiration for cubbyhole should ideally remove all the entries from database associated with that cubbyhole.
in the example, the final count of db entries should be
vault should be able to connect to the etcd3 cluster via the grpc-proxy.
- approle documentation is easily accessible via the vault website
an error message to the requesting user or within vault's logging that the role either isn't allowed on that database or the database configuration doesn't allow that role.
i expected vault to start up and let me unseal it like all previous upgrades.
the github auth method should work.
docs and actual behavior should be consistent.
vault can handle many credentials being created and revoked at the same time.
a confirmation dialog should appear asking for the policy deletion
connected rds mssql users who have their lease expired/revoked have their access revoked and are disconnected from the database.
web ui cli shoud fill whole web page.
do not show "revoke" in dropdown when cert is already revoked.
the output should contain the new temporary iam credentials which can be used to login to aws cli.
vault process should release any socket in close_wait state.
i expect consistency between the two csr.
i think the answer should be consistent in both cases, for authenticated and non-authenticated clients as well.
it should return `200` with an empty list.
i expected the result of step 6 (above) to be exactly the same as step 7.
batchwriterecords should check the response from batchwriteitem for unprocessed items and include them in the next request.
ideally it would also implement and increasingly large backoff algorithm to make it more likely that requests will not be throttled
all save should be successful
either do not show the "more points" (...) or show the contents of the dropdown menu (<nav class="menu">).
<img width="666" alt="screen shot at 17 33 10" src=" phofurl
in the case of the vault agent, i would like it handles the failure.
the code here phofhyperlink panics because of the nil value of `secret`.
patch could be: phofcode but this manages only case of vault agent as all clients should be impacted because this code phofhyperlink .
the secret should be created without error.
returned token id for given role id
no empty line at the beginning.
the website documentation and path-help mention list operation.
i'm not sure if vault team is willing to break client interface, since it's 1.0.0
1. vault should prompt for an mfa code.
2. vault should use credentials of the assumed role to generate signed payloads for the login action.
3. in theory, the login should succeed and you should be able to access vault, but i haven 't reached this point yet.
first all service account keys should be removed, then the service accounts disabled and then the secret backend.
test is running without panic on setting variable on empty resource
memory goes down again or plateaus.
the receiving entity should only have one reference to the alias.
`increase` value added to original `ttl` value
integers or booleans should be converted to a string form and returned in the map[string]string response.
should auth succesfully or fail gracefully
successful setup of totp key under jzarnett%40example.com
vault should be checking existence of a policy name that is attached to a role - or log anything to the main log in case it can 't resolve policy name
`create new version` should work the same if json is toggled on or off
vault can be install using homebrew on macos with cgo enabled so connections can be made to vault servers using vpn connections.
can read and write keys where policy is pointing to
modest memory growth as a function of inherited groups.
i would expect even hundreds of inherited groups to be supported.
i had expected the identities to be reaped when the associated tokens expired.
or alternatively that it would not create a new identity entity for each new machine authenticating.
the key `prefix/` should either be not listable and not readable, or listable and readble when using `prefix/*` policy.
use test as expected (possibly i missunderstood something)
it signs the certificate with the requested lifespan
for the lease to be renewed
the host header of the http request should be as specified by the url typed by the user this would allow loadbalancers behind srv records to be able to route properly requests to their backend
on prior to 0.11.2, those tokens stay getting renewed properly: phofcode now they just keep getting regenerated somehow: phofcode
i'd expect to be able to see all entities, no matter if they have or haven't logged in at least once.
the `not before:` field should be set to the current date of certificate generation.
i expected the mount to be cleanly removed.
it is now a schrodinger mount.
after removing the 'child group' from 'parent group' it should no longer be in the 'parent group'
the token is successfully revoked.
a certificate should be issued under the pki using the oid specified in `other_sans`
i expected vault to present the new cert.
an error if this is not a supported operation on old secrets instances.
limited increase in latency and no errors
token should have been properly stored with a deprecation warning against the use of an old key or documentation should be updated accordingly.
a firm warning of silly behavior.
it is expected that if the token is valid for use on the cli or via api, that it would also be valid for use with the ui.
the vault container should remain up.
* an error should be thrown when a second group alias is created with the same canonical id.
* (optional) a flag should be provided to allow skipping the current canonical_id against an existing group checks when updating or deleting a group-alias.
i expected * vault * to perform a clear * http * connection, rather than https vault server configuration file(s): phofcode
according to the doc, we should get a 200 and the following response: phofcode
aliases should get loaded properly
the ui should redirect to the first auth method with "list method when unauthenticated" option
vault is unsealed and available but instead it restarts and is sealed again.
vault logs "error 503: backend error" instead of "invalid request"
the output says `version: 0.11.0`
vault always returns correct info about mounts (including mount_accessor)
vault acknowledges that the account does not exist (for example by checking the response the iam api gives) and stops trying to remove the account.
or alternatively have a way that you can stop vault from trying to revoke accounts.
it is expected that the vault process would pass the os environment(including ld_library_path) into the secondary plugin process so that it can find the client libraries outside of standard library paths.
1. token is able able to list all resources in `secret` 2. token is not allowed to list the content of `secret/notvisible` as the documentation phofhyperlink states that the more specific path takes precedence.
i expect vault to either * reject * my json if it is not compatible or malformed, or accept it *without modification*.
the final command to create a token with policy=root should fail as the approle only has policies `bug` and `default`
the list of secret should be sorted alphabetically like in kv v2 secret store.
the s3 backend should work, and also all the unit tests of s3 backend should pass.
works in 0.9.6 with no changes to any terraform versions, modules, etc.
expecting to be able to read secrets in kv version 2. it doesn 't work with ui but it works with api.
they should be filled with the correct data
the only vault services that should appear in the catalog are actual vault nodes.
we expect to get a list of configured certificate names.
as mentioned here phofurl phofcode
ui login should work in new lowercase "favorited" ldap.
the leader should die or step down.
expected path to be usable.
if the data has been returned to the client, it should be returned.
* db backend handles nil interface in role config safely / doesn 't allow invalid config to be written * vault doesn 't attempt to revoke token when revocation statement is not present.
i would expect vault to continue to function and respond to api requests, without interruption, in the event of losing an etcd unit.
in `plugin.server`, set the max receive size to a value similar to or the same as the max send size, which would align to the changes made for #4843. alternately, allow both send and receive values to be configurable via `plugin.serveopts`.
the secret id access should always be successful like in the example above after the vault restart.
i expected the client to ssh to the host machine please help me fix this issue.
i tried the work around mentioned in the document ( phofurl still it doesn 't work.
gcp storage backend should allow login by unregistered users.
it should roll back to display the previous version of the secret.
_json_ switch should work for all test cases as it does for secrets strings.
a clear explanation of how the most basic operation works.
the token should be unwrapped and returned
1. i think it should be impossible to add the root ca 's serial number to the crl.
2. if for some reason it * should * be possible, then it would be nice to be able to remove certificates from the crl if you, for example, accidentally revoked your root ca.
3. i 'm not sure, but i don 't think the root ca should even listed under `pki/certs`, is it there for a reason?
i thought only certs you issued would show up there.
* vault server version 0.10.3
the value of the boolvar flag should be correctly populated from the environment.
i expected a 503 to be returned.
all aliases are tied to the entity.
the ability to specify my own configuration without having to use `defaultconfig`
vault server should at least start.
in 0.10.3 the server bounces and re-seals
file > 4mb should have the same behavior.
switch on the legacy forwarding creates issue with https support
v1 of the secret should be returned.
i 'm unable to check via cli as there 's no example and i 've been unable to guess the format thus far in case there is one!
the list of secret should be sorted alphabetically.
but it works fine via vault cli phofcode
i would expect an error in the plugin (perhaps crashing the plugin) and an error response from the api call that triggered the problem, not vault itself crashing.
the folders should be navigable just as if i had navigated to that path from the root secret path.
all ok with deprecated postgres plugin: phofcode
to get the same options as when auth method was enabled.
if the values of the stored fields cannot be retrieved, then the fields should be displayed with contents of '<unable to retrieve>' or similar.
i was expecting, after rekey operation, the status to be updated among all instances; and no problems when unsealing that instance.
fixes to prevent this from happening altogether, or depending on the cause, graceful degradation / recovery.
i expect vault to shut down.
i should receive the original secret.
should be checked as on chrome.
i can make it work if i run `vault kv get -wrap-ttl=10m secret/data/foo`.
note that i inserted * data * prefix in the path, then vault unwrap returns valid data: phofcode i would expect `vault kv get -wrap-ttl=10m secret/foo` work as before (like kv 1), to keep it consistent with other vault kv command?
see the actual error (which in our case was a permission error)
vault ssh should respect the users ssh_config and not append default values which should be handled by the ssh client.
the `-o userknownhostsfile=` flag should only be appended to the ssh command if `-user-known-hosts-file` has been set.
from a technical point of view this would mean removing the default value for `-user-known-hosts-file` and only appending it when `flaguserknownhostsfile != ""`
it returns the correct entries
tidy should never delete unexpired certificates.
i should see a token generated and returned to the vault client instead of an error, plus i should see the plugin log the passed arguments to either stdout or the server 's log file
operations running without the delay.
consul leader is chosen, vault leader chosen, and expected write to be successful, and listing of the same to be successful.
i did not expect the following capabilities to required in my policy.
the mysql user should be of less than 16 char or there should be other way to specify the number of character
1. default is `key_type = any` 2. if not default, at least setting it should be possible.
that the model begins training.
i expect the tokenizers to output identical tokenizations so that fine-tuning is consistent with pre-training.
i expect the tokenizer to handle double spaces.
it should be `text with percentage%`, which treats the symbol in the word as one word.
the expected output of this script is below: [sep] 50258 [pad] 50257 all special tokens: ['<|endoftext|>', '[pad]', '[sep]'] all special ids: [50256, 50257, 50258] the actual output is: [sep] 50258 [pad] 50257 all special tokens: ['<|endoftext|>', '[pad]', '[sep]'] all special ids: [50256, 50256, 50256] as you can see, ids do not match the actual ids of the [sep] and [pad] token.
not sure why this is the case.
am i misunderstanding something about how add_special_tokens works?
you should see an error stating that tf2.0 does not has a mean function.
file line 442: ``output = tf.mean(hidden_states, axis=1)`` should be ``output = axis=1)`` phofcode
since it finishes training and evaluation of the first few checkpoints with the aforementioned setting, i would expect it to be able to evaluate every checkpoint without error.
however, it seems that there is a bug in the evaluation code.
i assume it is not properly clearing the memory after testing each checkpoint.
the crash does not occur with the default `--length 20`.
i 'm trying to make this work for faster generation speed.
so i tested the change with a smaller length that does not crash, but i observe the speed with caching is slightly slower than without.
the expected behavior is that loss should not be nan.
fine-tuning bert on mnli 3/unknown - 4s 1s/step - loss: nan - accuracy: 0.2031
the script should train on glue when using tfroberta just as it trains when using tfbert.
the script should run just as `run_tf_glue.py`
the script should run the same as tf_run_glue.py
successfully load the pretrained model.
should produce a robertatokenizer instance, which can also be used for `distilroberta-base`.
i have try the implementation from github, it seems to be fine : def """runs basic whitespace cleaning and splitting on a piece of text."""
text = text.strip() if not text: return [] tokens = text.split() return tokens def tokenize(text): output_tokens = [] for token in chars = list(token) if len(chars) > 100: continue is_bad false start 0 sub_tokens [] while start < len(chars): end len(chars) cur_substr none while start < end: substr if start > 0: substr "
i expect to be able to type in a prompt and see text generated.
when the model is downloaded from s3, it is stored to default cache directory in directory, instead to `./cache`, as specified in `--cache_dir` argument.
seems like `--cache_dir` argument isn't used in `.from_pretrained()` methods in lines 472, 473 and 477 the run_lm_finetuning.py script.
passing in `past` should not throw an error and should speed up generation
pretrained weights should load just fine.
the speed probably should stay the same.
warning-free training, or a warning that 's easy to interpret for the user.
the expectation is that [sep] is output from the `decode` function.
i did not expect this behavior to require pytorch
* [ ] handle all glue datasets from `tensorflow_datasets` correctly p.s.
: a colleague and i are currently working on a fix and will submit a pr for this issue in the next couple of minutes.
training to complete without error.
while using language model finetuning for roberta-base, i got an error cublas runtime error : resource allocation failed at when i checked the tokenized dataset, i observed that it had 514 tokens, i.e.
512 coming from max_len_single_sentence plus 2 special tokens.
roberta tokenizer should have max_len_single_sentence set to 510 just like the one in bert.
max_len_single_sentence = max_len - 2
decode method of the tokenizer should return a string and not a list.
not sure if init_weights should be inherited or if it 's a type (there is _init_weights phofhyperlink in the distilberttokenizer class)
i expect the decoder to return the string `"special token"`
i expect phofcode to initialize a tokenizer with the same behavior as phofcode .
-> not give the error.
and work like it is supposed to,
i expect `autotokenizer` to return a `robertatokenizer` object initialized with the `vocab.json` and `merges.txt` file from
text generation like using "gpt2" as `model_name_or_path`.
at evaluation time, the tokenizer should also be cased, but because it's loading from a path and not using a model name, the `from_pretrained` method in `berttokenizer` fails to identify casing information, and the `basictokenizer` defaults to uncased (`do_lower_case=true`).
expected to get eval results and for the script to exit with 0.
get all datapoints of the last 30 mins.
would expect the values of the tag "host" to be delivered.
up until recent builds there was an add member button in the header of the members tab.
a warning notifying the user that a bucket is needed to generate a configuration
i guess i should log in, and be able to do stuff.
i've never used influxdb before :(
describe what you expected to happen.
the `_variable` field should display the mapped value (`10s`)
cloned cell should be same size as original
expecting four tables, each with data for the individual tag, grouped by day.
data should be restored into the temp db.
all the fields are selectable
the task should be created without sleeping.
should be able to input single digit bin sizes after deleting the existing bin size
the write should have just succeeded.
i don 't expect a successful build with an incorrect version but it was a dependency i didn 't check before hand.
stats returned by array cursor iterator should be one of (i am unsure of the desired behavior): - the accumulated stats for all observed cursors - the current in-focus cursor (i have assumed this one so far)
if all values are correct expect to see a notification that the configuration was successfully saved
i would expect this query to return two field columns, the raw value, and the difference between subsequent values.
describe what you expected to happen.
would expect the derivative select to return a list with the time and values,
cpu usage is the same between point 4 and 6
i 'd expect `insert test` and `insert "test"` to write to the same measurement.
it should work fine and write data into the database as normal.
when select "modified", expect dashboards to sort by modified in asc/desc order
the form to be empty
expected the label to be created and added to the template card.
this is the behavior of a similar process for adding labels to telegrafs.
expect to see reliably (99.9% of the time) the template just uploaded.
the result of the query provided above should look like this output: phofcode
expected that the template view would remain on "user templates" list and that the new template card would be immediately visible.
it makes little sense to switch to static templates from the upload, since it appears all uploaded templates are "user templates".
a valid answer from influxdb api.
nb : i did the exact same steps on my laptop (ubuntu, x86_64) and it works as expected.
that the value in the urls field will be validated and if valid, the wizard will return to the review step.
if invalid an error message would be supplied.
previously it returned to review step and plugin was red, green or grey depending on validity or existence of plugin urls value.
dashboard list view to populate with my dashboards
resultset returns data with inserted row
i expected the data recovery to ingest to the database.
flux query should just work
expecting to see saved data
* all time slices are filled if there are no gaps in data collection.
* timestamps returned on a limit of time >= $sometime returns only times with a value larger than $sometime
should restore all shards without warnings.
be able to edit buckets that token can read from / write to, or at least be able to re-use token for a bucket with same name.
expected that the full value would remain visible and that a color swatch sample would appear beside the input.
describe what you expected to happen.
ui buttons at top of window should scale or render in multiple rows.
horizontal scrolling would be minimum behavior.
get the same output with the 2 queries.
i want to query something like: > select id,asset_id from my_table where ( (time > and time < or (time > and time < ) for return 2 rows
a graph with the date, without "undefined" suffix
see tags in data explorer
that the telegraf cards would be sorted alphanumerically based on the bucket names
that the set of resource cards displayed would be reduced to match the filter term as applied to the resource card names.
cell contents, same behavior as selecting the green check in cell configuration mode.
min and max values to be populated
expect controls to redraw themselves smoothly and in proportion with the browser window dimensions.
describe what you expected to happen.
the newly created check should be saved.
the `notificationrule` should be validated before its create.
view telegraf configuration or settings
data should have been written in chunk as well.
describe what you expected to happen.
looking at the results from the rest endpoint it appears that retention policies are now reported as an array of object {type: "expire", everyseconds: long}.
i do not see a name property associated with retention policies, so i would expect the retention policy sort to work by the length of policy.
without a name, an alphanumeric sort makes little sense.
expected sort from current example: 1.
1 hours = 3600s 1.
12 hours = 43200s 1.
1 days = 86400s 1.
1 days 12 hours = 3 days 28 days
accord between number and unit(s) should be grammatically correct.
expected bucket to be created.
the original owner should be removed successfully.
and the api response should be a 204.
that the wizard would lead me to a useful page in the ui.
expected to be able to enter the full bucket name and to be able to review all field values before continuing.
when telegraf shuts down, influx closes open connections
error message stating:" not defined"
describe what you expected to happen.
describe what you expected to happen.
when a task is created the task create action needs to pass through the task stack in order to be scheduled.
more specifically a task create has to pass thought the coordinator.
this allow's task's to be added and removed from the scheduler as well as enforcement of ownership limit's.
the first rule continues to match, so the "system.loadavg" measurement continues to be populated.
result should be the same whether using single or double quotes.
detailed error which explains that : `could not retrieve buckets for query.spec: option "task " redeclared at 7:1-13:2` once this is removed and resaved: detail error which explains that the `to()` is missing an `org:` option.
once this is removed and resaved: detailed error which explains the buckets do not exist if not already created.
that generated functions added to the pipeline should not lead to errors based on parameter naming or type mismatch.
this is expected to create a new bucket "my-bucket" in org "my-org" with a retention period of nanoseconds
i expect only mymetric_2m measurement would have indexed data : phofcode
expected to have old data cleared off
the query returns within a reasonable time (seconds at most), and the server doesn 't crash.

a messagepack response is returned.
response should be " "
an error regarding the missing time unit or similar to without using `aggregatewindow` and no significant increase in memory usage.
i expect to see clean logs.
the query process(es) should see data that is only few (on average less than 50) ms old (since new data is being inserted regularly)
i expect a new authorization (orgid, userid, permissions) where userid is the one i pass via
describe what you expected to happen.
gauge should add negative numbers to the the tick-marks
i was expecting either an error message, or perhaps just the columns that were correct to be shown
the literal gets pushed down to storage for more efficient behavior by using the constant value in the variable.
should see keys instead of values.
screen shot at 1 35 19 pm phofimage
measurement and its data is only deleted from one retention policy
that the frame for popup and similar dialog windows should remain within the view port along with their controls.
behavior in v1.4.2: new measurement `test2` is created with data filled from the oldest timestamp and grouped by 1 day.
the points should be saved in the measurement with the correct rp.
it should look closer to templates.
expected that sorting by description should work by alpha, whether ascending or descending, based on values in the description field.
expected that the required field name would be flagged or highlighted and that the user would be notified that a required field was empty/had an invalid value.
or that the submit button should be grayed until all required fields are filled.
expected that the label asdf would remain visible and the other labels would be hidden.
i expect an update to a task to either fail to update if the task can no longer run because of permissions issues, or for it to update the token allow for it run
being able to query and write to influxdb, not restarting all the time
the label should show no offset after its removed.
`feature requests` point to ` phofurl and `report a bug` point to ` phofurl
yum verify should complete without error.
expected influxdb to start successfully
if i select a csv or map type, the variable list should say `csv` or `map` not `query`
describe what you expected to happen.
the `math.abs` function and many others are not pipe-forwardable (they don't accept input tables `<-` as one of their parameters) so they should not be put in the script with a pipe-forward operator `|>`.
load the remote bucket information
records with tags vaue >= '11 ' should be deleted or if operator is not supported, query should be ignored.
[what you expected to happen] select mean(value),host from "measurement1" where ("host" =~ /aa./) and time >= now() - 30d group by host the sql above should not response err.
the queries should return in approx the same time
influxdb would start up correctly
return list of authorizations for the authenticated user
[n specifies the number of series to return]
no measurements to be returned because there is no point in the `cpu` measurement with tagset `t1=1,t2=1`.
time should be set to epoch time of last cq run
system worked well till i did update to the latest version around mid december (last time i updated was in july 2018.
a graph is shown with values from the last 30 days.
[memory should not be allocated forever when running queries]
[what you expected to happen] expect the 2nd step to complete in a reasonable amount of time & memory.
but it runs out of memory.
within a minute or two.
same behavior even when the memory is increased up to 12g.
so, then modified the side loading statement to use a single measurement such as "cpu", which has about 14 million endpoints.
but it still runs out of memory select count(*) from cpu shows about points then, we reduced the number of points be imported be much smaller time windows, something like this.
this finally completed but after several minutes (close 7 8 min) > select * into telegraf..:measurement from /.

[what you expected to happen] not seeing an error
** it should reduce the db size once we deleted data **
[what you expected to happen] - select operation have no effect on insert - cpu not too high
[what you expected to happen] i am able to type flux commands into the window as i would any other repl environment.
after some time the system should behave approximately the same as before the change.
in particular compactions should be leveled: newly snapshotted `tsm` files are compacted in `level=1`, which are in turn merged in `level=2`.
[what you expected to happen] reduce memory usage
file should be imported correctly.
deleting a measurement for a given timeperiod should only affect shard for that time period.
this will make it much faster.
the series index should only be rebuilt when we actually delete data.
result should be the same whether using single or double quotes.
> select mean(count) from channel_site_count where site and time > time group by time(2m), site fill(previous) name: channel_site_count tags: phofcode name: channel_site_count tags: site=sip%%730 phofcode
it should eventually stop compaction which does not seem to progress.
[what you expected to happen] only version is reported phofcode
a cq that runs every 3 seconds
i would expect that if the field `stddev_temp` in `weather_daily` is created at all, it should be created with a numeric type, as it would be if the number of items in the bucket was anything other than 1.
(since it seems phofhyperlink influxdb includes bessel 's correction and influxdb does not support nan or infinity, not being created at all seems most natural to me.)
time max 20671 20671 20671 20671
since the data is identical, the merge should complete without any errors
error status with `failed to create physical plan: invalid time bounds from procedure from: bounds contain zero time` as the error.
backup is restored on the remote instance
points should be added to database
i don't expect influxdb to use this much variable memory, or i expect some way to control it.
at the least i should have a way to diagnose what uses all that memory.
i am not sure but may be influxdb should * warn * that this time format incorrect according phofurl or query engine should understand that you need limit grouping only for existed measurement (several days) not a time range since 1 january 1970 ideally it will be great to limit somehow globally that i have all metrics **only > for example and nor any adhoc query by other users nor time range variable from grafana phofurl **don 't crash** influxdb server

i expect the first time interval to be the intuitive or
[what you expected to happen] the query result
same value for the calculated integral, compared to a regular phofcode query.
[what you expected to happen] image pull succeeds.
all queries show the same results
there are six intervals and the first interval is at the start time chosen.
after step 7 i expected nothing would be printed
retention policy should be created
the number of points reported by dumptsm and the number of points identified by the query are the same.
no errors, prometheus is able to read and write to influxdb
queries should "union" both values by "0" timestamp image phofimage
all 3 queries should have returned data in similar range
[what you expected to happen] service should restart and be available on both http and unix socket.
in our eyes, this should be the correct output: phofcode
[what you expected to happen] fail to set password if it contains characters that influx db doesn 't not allow in the password field.
no oom happens and service is not disrupted.
influxdb installs without requiring shadow-utils for useradd
the migration of 37gb data from a csv file should be fairly fast.
after upgrading and changing config influx should use tsi
i would have expected the database "sensors" to be found, since it was listed before.
i only get measurements for which the last recorded value (in time space) is prior to the 19th of july
no `"partial": true` flag in json response
the write-ahead-log is being compressed into tsm files.
having a base measurement with this structure: phofcode i want to use a continuous query to group by `time(1h)`, `appcodename` and `host`.
so that the result should be a downsampling like: phofcode
the versioning scheme should be the same on both platform
[what you expected to happen] javascript code worked.
no data get 's lost
[what you expected to happen] some sort of error indicating bad ilp
at this point, i expected to see: restoring offline from backup /tmp/recent/mydb.

results returned as per previously successful operation.
i expect to have the percentile i requested at step 2 and 3.
i expect to see rows in the table like this: phofcode
i would expect that authentication settings do not affect query performance.
only the part within the outer query range is returned, but taken from the inner query so there are no nulls: phofcode
every time the query response time should be around 160 seconds.
[what you expected to happen] should return all measurements where the measurement name matches the regular expression.
data should be returned for whatever exists in the table
when starting influxdb again, some data is lost but the database is still operational
the measurement is still available even if influxd is killed.
4 and 6 should delete all series from tag value
the database `test` is restored as `test_bak`
the newline character should be escaped before writing the line protocol statement, like if it was in a field value.
the query should return the same number of points as the tsm file.
faster results as was the case in version 1.4.3
field c: windows is created
[what you expected to happen]
[what you expected to happen] influx start successful
`show measurements` shows measurement name with spaces and no backslashes
tags not to be renamed
[what you expected to happen]
all data should have been persisted and be available after restart.
should return log2 values for associated field values.
get the mean value back
the query should return field values for all field keys that match the regular expression.
`top()` pulls the greatest field values.
in that context, most people expect the results will be sorted by value, not timestamp.
[what you expected to happen] move broken files out of data storage dir and start new, or fix broken file automatically.
[what you expected to happen] data written into write database
influxdb should consume about 1.2 gb of ram, as it was with 1.4.2 version
same http response for both cases
[what you expected to happen] influxdb should not crash.
the where-clause of the newly created continuous query should be "where utcoffsettag = \'+0400 \'"
result of first query is ` {time, price, price} 9447 9462 9448 9463 ` i expect result os second query to be ` {time, price} 9447 9448 9462 9463 `
to get this as output: phofcode
the query should return the number of distinct values for tag `database` that have data for the last day.
at above step 3: phofcode i would expect `membytes` to increase twice as fast with the cq because old, resampled data doesn 't differ from previously inserted data.
all data from measurement deleted
database `test` is restored along with user that has grants on the db.
full(metastore, databases) backup is created.
[what you expected to happen] upgrade to latest version
influxdb is exactly the same after a restore, as before i destroyed it.
[what you expected to happen] - influx page should display
to return the records in very less time
heap memory consumption should be less than without tsi.
[what you expected to happen] in both calculations the integral for the timestamp should be
[what you expected to happen]
rpm installation processing without error
the remote backup should work because there is no documented requirement of the remote and the client being the same version.
other database command line tools are also not very picky with regards to the server version being used.
[what you expected to happen] if i do a where host =~ /edge.
*fqdn.com$/ it used to work up until upgrading to 1.5.
influxdb should start and load databases without crashing
list all tag values with key "host"
`grant read on _internal` is executed successfully.
[what you expected to happen] same startup time in all versions
write continues in v1.4.2 influx to the same database without any errors
values of tag key "uniq" where tag `
the query should return 1 measurement and 1 series.
[i expect a row count of ]
[what you expected to happen] two fast queries.
normal cpu usage, and some cpu spikes.
get the result with null values like so: phofcode
one point for every week is returned.
[what you expected to happen] it should have generated a backup locally
the release date (in the changelog) for v1.4.3 in the 1.4 branch should be in 2018.
all data should be returned.
the script shall change the admin password to `val`
[what you expected to happen] same number of records produced by first, max, min and last
influxdb to insert new data for each metric
[what you expected to happen] phofcode
values to be sorted before `difference` applies so i get phofcode
i expected `influxdb` to log to
points have been fully restored from the export files
influx should not try to open .tsm files that was never created.
the content of the tar.gz file should be tar gzipped content with pprof data.
intuitively, i expect `select [whatever] where field=value` to be slow because fields aren 't indexed, but once the point with that field=value was found, the whole point was found.
therefore, select 'ing just the field, or the field and tags, should be as fast.
host should push data into influxdb.
and host should be visible in influx db.
the same as in the previous versions, i.e.
the expression which can be reduced to a constant during ast processing is accepted and correctly evaluated.
` 'a '= 'a '` would be equivalent to `true`, `count * (1 / 1)` would be the same as `count * 1`
we select only the `by_duration` field, for which all values have the `duration` tag, so i dont understand why we 're getting this group returned.
i have tried to confirm that we dont have a record causing issues, by adding clauses like `where "duration" != ""` and `where "duration" != null` and neither seems to have any effect.
i 'm unclear how empty values are handled, and if these types of where clauses are even a valid approach; i also tried to find such records like `select * from "account_winbacks" where "duration" = ""` and got no records, so it appears this isnt the correct approach.
it looks like this is a bug in the way grouping by tag is handled when using multiple series in a measure, but i may be missing something.
would love any additional feedback or troubleshooting steps.
the counts, or, at worst, `err: query-timeout limit exceeded`
a value is quickly returned
[what you expected to happen]
full compaction should always give non-overlapping blocks for a given measurement/field/tag combination.
the index should start on either 0 or 1 in both index and block section.
the second derivative entry should not exist at all - it should be ignored as clearly erroneous (as the negative derivative is).
it would not be unexpected (but not desirable) if it is some utterly enormous number (~infinity) it is very unclear where this current number comes from; presumably some function of the maximum value of a data structure and the precise way its being calculated.
influxdb should not crash, each query should return after a few 100 ms. memory consumption for the query should be <1 mb.
i hope that performance will improve, at least remain stable
[the setting should help with the issue]
step 2 should come back with a consistent response from a query of data0's count.
step 3 should not timeout.
log events that x meta servers are non responsive.
issuing influxd-ctl commands should return error output that the cluster isn 't working due to to few meta nodes
influxdb should return a response code of `4xx`
all queries should get an proper result.
if server-error occur they should be logged in the journal and counted in the _internal,http measurement.
only the deleted times and series are deleted.
points will be added with nano percision since my retention policy is for the current year and point are new.
[what you expected to happen] concat path with e.g.
results grouped by days, offset to current time.
have similar performance between 1.3.7 and 1.4.1
[what you expected to happen] i would expect these queries to take about the same amount of time
when upgrading influxdb in the past, things just worked without requiring explicit backup and restore of the database.
this included moving to the tsi index from the inmen index in 1.3.x.
have tag values according to actual data
i want to put the min fixed string into result set.
influxd should begin running in the background
influxql should not require a space after the regex operator
after influxdb instance crashes data integrity should not be affected, as the data exists but not recovered correctly (an assumption on my behalf).
influxdb should recover once nfs share is back online
the full query should reduce the result set from the sub query using the where clause, so only outdated series are eturned.
the performance should be similar.
the line protocol series is added on influxdb.
i expected there to either be an error returned, or that the result would be consistent with `select field1 as new_name, field2 as new_name from m`
i expect the data to be returned to have the correct timestamp as in the database, regardless of the time used in aggregation function.
error message indicating an issue with communicating with the influxdb server
generated configuration file should parse without errors.
log message suggests to set your license via either config file or environment variables ** ** or ** ** .
writes continue and data is persisted for 10 years in line with the retention policy (and the expiration date of the shards).
[what you expected to happen] subscriber should receive all points on a single connection in the same order they were sent to influxdb
influx cli can connect to remote host behind the proxy.
responsive cluster, application should handle that situation or show a specific error in logs.
an output containing all measurements with all values.
(just a dump from my database).
the same results as: select p51 + p55 + p57 as p from l11
if the query is valid, return results, else return clear and actionable error messages.
this might be a configuration issue or a syntax issue, but in any case a clear message must be returned.
authenticate and operate with database
the duration returned by show retention policies should be a valid formated duration, which can be used in a alter retention policy query
influxdb to log the the
a parse error should be returned when not single quoting a tag values.
the first and last query above parse successfully and return no results which is confusing.
the executed query is actually trying to compare a tag with another tag that does not exist.
this functionality is not currently supported.
database "with space" created, ability to use it in cli queries
use around the same amount of memory between versions for the same dataset.
one field shall always have the same data type
this statement works fine: phofcode phofcode i would expect to change the query by adding one additional aggregate column on the inner select and have that also rolled up into a single table in the outer select... similar to this: phofcode
[what you expected to happen] no errors
i expcted all cqs to run and the two downsampling retentions to have data.
[what you expected to happen] all queried aggregates should be grouped into one result per group-set.
two result rows should occur.
when limiting two rows are presented: `select mean("rtt") as "avg.
", min("rtt") as "min", max("rtt") as "max", count(rtt), last(rtt), stddev("rtt") as "std.
", median("rtt") "median", percentile("rtt",95) "95% percentile", percentile("rtt",99) "99% percentile" from "fping-measurement" where "host" =~ /smokeping-fra1/ group by "producer", "host" limit 300` screen shot at 11 16 06 phofimage
the data is completely exported according to the given command line options
i expected to see dumptsi listed as one of the commands because it is documented as one of the commands.
an error would be returned.
either the password must be rejected while creating user (or while setting password) or it should be properly authenticated.
when losing an hour, the time advances from 2:00 am to 3:00 am.
i expect the interval starting at 12:00 am to go to 3:00 am (since 2 am advances to 3 immediately) and i expect the 2 interval go from 3 4 am.
the time zone should influence when the cq gets run so you get the data in the correct time zone.
database should back up normally.
all databases not starting with an underscore character back up without any issues.
[what you expected to happen] measurement named `a =b` created
influxdb should be able to accept all the data pushed to it
if i get an error - i should have some context to know what was the issue
expect that any datapoint that is submitted via http post and logged via http write-tracing would make it into the measurement and be query-able.
[what you expected to happen] the continuous query should run with a time range from thursday - thursday as this is how the 7d period is grouped (based on epoch time)
[what you expected to happen] not see errors in the log.
[what you expected to happen] reduce disk usage
i expected to see the restored telegraf database
[what you expected to happen] receive complete points with all fields populated.
data with the given tag deletes
if it starts throwing error 500 's should likely have other logging to track down the root issue
we expect the returned result to be have a "serial" tag value of " ** ** "
not to find any duplicate points in the select results (at any time)
would dump 2 small test databases.
/var/lib/influxdb only consumes 145m of disk space in my testing environment.
when i restrict the exports by use of the `-database <dbname>` argument, my resulting dumps are both less than 2mb.
i am expecting influxdb to return; 1. a valid json 2. a data set containing the linear interpolated result
i would expect both of these queries to return similar types of responses.
results should be returned grouped by `host_name` aliased as `host`.
[what you expected to happen] phofcode
i expected the `bottom()` queries in steps two and three to return results.
normal process output should be printed as stdout, not stderr
i tried to insert more data with another characters, such as !, $, =, :, _ and so on, and all of them are shown when checking measurements.
i thougth that would be the case for #.
* would see unique values
expected is to have one measurement df with values stored in fileds named "used" and "free".
at least it 's how it 's described on mailing list: phofurl phofhyperlink
these errors should not appear disk space usage seems exagerated in one of the databases (telegraf-dev, the one with highest usage)
[what you expected to happen] influxdb should not try to allocate all available memory
we try to obtain the top 6 virtual machine with more broadcasttx .
no error message about missing .tsm.tmp files.
[what you expected to happen] i would expect to have data with both query as the only difference is the time range (1m difference on a range of around 40 minutes)
compactions run without exhausting available disk space.
i would expect the second point to have a null value for 'b ' as it does in the json response: phofcode
for the deleted data to always be absent
[what you expected to happen] all databases restore as exist on the instance the backup was taken from.
when doing a "show series" in a user database the _internal series should not appear.
all values meeting the criteria should have been deleted.
* data is uploaded to influxdb
i would imagine it gives me the correct answer too, but not necessarily.
identical shape of results i.e one row with sum and percentile values both having timestamp
i would expect influxdb to only group time ranges that fully fit the into the queried time range (in this case, time ranges that have already passed) example: - the last time covered by the query (`now()`) is - the last query result covers the range - - _(i'm unsure if `time` field of result should be or
i expected to see the difference between two sets of counter based data.
results should be returned from both measurements: phofcode
[what you expected to happen] zeroes must be overwritten
you are back at your original bash session, the influx shell process is backgrounded and it shows up in the `jobs` listing.
* ** orange ** should be associated with ** apple ** tag * bar should be associated with **a foo** tag
[what you expected to happen] influxdb stores data sent by collectd in the specified table
time series should be sorted ascending and difference should be done after.
no parse error, the same result as with: > select * from my_measurement where time > now()- 1m and db='mydb'; or > select * from my_measurement where time > now() - 1m and db='mydb';
same result as with this select statement that uses a sub-query instead of nesting: select derivative(x, 1m) from (select as x from measurement where $timefilter group by $interval)
[what you expected to happen] expected to see the report.
both selects should return the same mean value for processcpuload.
- influxdb will start with the default cfg (or some manually edited cfg) - installed packages should not start unless manually enabled by the administrator or via some config mgmt solution.
error that the db does not exist.
i expected data to be inserted properly with the retention policy.
if user root has privileges to create database, and this function works perfectly well in influxdb cli or with curl, it should also work in this client lib.
i have 4 routers data in 2 sites, trying to aggregate this data based on some tag/keys.
this works fine when using the cli but the json data is incorrect.
i 'm expecting 4 sets of data coming back.
proper outout like below - which works properly in my current influxdb 1.0.0~rc1-1 phofcode
maybe i missed something but it seems that
both queries should return the same results
when my_value finally gets new data i expect it to calculate the difference between the imputed/filled data, 10, with the new data, 11, not the difference between 0 and new data.
meaning difference(my_value) should yield: [10, 0, 0 ** 1 ** ].
i 'd expect consistent microsecond syntax across everything.
this could just be a docs issue - i, maybe incorrectly, thought everything adhered to phofurl i do think having a consistent syntax would make influxdb easier to use.
get http status 204 response and have the new data written, or get a 4xx response when no data is written for whatever reason
i 'd expect the query in step 4 to return the average value of `toads` calculated across values of `toad` that are greater than three: phofcode
the data contained in the measurement
return the same thing before/after reboot, or restrict names to reduce usable character set (probably too late for that).
expect to have a running influxdb
response holds all values (> 10000) and does not return the key `"partial":true`
[what you expected to happen] phofcode
i expect to see time values ascending in order, and only positive values as this is an increasing time series data
last value timestamp should be in about one minute of last data phofcode
either: phofcode or the actual response (see bellow) to be in the documentation or a more precise documentation of the possible responses phofhyperlink or a more precise documentation of the influxdb 's versioning scheme and its compatibility guarantees.
[what you expected to happen] then many queries fail to render anything (including null values).
we need to see data in snapshots or chunks of time for all supported ranges in grafana (up to 5 years).
we were expecting data in tables/graphs show up for that point in time - even if null.
[what you expected to happen] i hope to write data to cli.
i 'd expect the request in step two to return the results that i got in step three.
the value 3 should be returned.
data is returned by query
the documentation says: > if you authenticate with both basic authentication and the url query parameters, the user credentials specified in the query parameters take precedence.
so the given http basic credentials (_foo/bar_) should be ignored.
existing shards still use `inmem` index.
only data with a time stamp newer than the given date "since" for backup should be visible.
the results should be sorted increased in time
mass calculation using group by should produce the same results as when specifying tags.
that it works with subqueries and will affect the proper level of query when it is used.
the query timeout is applied to the lifetime of the whole query.
the number of series is equal for 1.1.1. and 1.2.0 for all queries
[the value of the fields "a" and "b" are correctly selected in all queries]
i expect the sub query to only return the items that match the where clause, after the sub query sorts them and limits them to one.
[what you expected to happen]
i 'd expect this to return an error like it did in 1.1.
[what you expected to happen] influxd is set to start at boot
based on this discussion phofhyperlink i would have expected influxdb to treat `color` as a field in both of the main queries.
so i would have expected to get the result in the second step when i `group by *` and when i `group by color`.
[what you expected to happen] query: `select statuscode from response where time > now() - 30m` expected to see statuscode from response measurement for the last 30 minutes.
i expect the above offset to have minimal impact on query performance on an empty db.
i could sort of understand slower performance on the second query on a full db, but in this case the db has no data other than the hour being queried for.
return an error if no database name is provided.
the piped insert statement should work.
this used to work in 0.10.x series.
in both cases, t1 should be available to select.
a) the group by clause segments the returned rows into subsets with identical characteristics.
in this case each subset must have an identical t1.
hence t1 should be selectable and reported for each subset of rows.
b) by restricting all returned rows to a specific tag (in the case of the where clause), t1 has a constant value for the entire set of rows examined.
the set functions max and min return results about set of rows.
t1 is also a known fact about set rows.
influxdb should be able to decrypt the packets and log the data from collectd.
i expect there to be 4 total rows in the response, corresponding with the inserted data.
[what you expected to happen] it should return data until the current day
database would be dropped without error or warning
[what you expected to happen] inlfuxdb should load all shards.
run two graphite listeners on two ports, which i can set via env variables
expect it to read/write to docker-volum correctly
for influx to not take up all available disk space
[what you expected to happen] only points inside that range gets deleted
the shard info should be preserved through the restart
data should be imported by the influxdb.
database should be imported up correctly.
[what you expected to happen] phofcode
[what you expected to happen] i would expect the call to timerange to return min = max = 0 since the or causes the where clause to cover all times.
continuous query should calculate averages over 2 minute periods for every series in the measurement.
[what you expected to happen] return a sample for the string field.
i 'm actually not sure what i expect `sample()` with `*` to do.
i specified `1` point but i 'll end up with three points, technically.
password prompt would appear and output of query would be captured into file
web browser tab open going to the documentation of the same version as the package.
in my case, influxdb-data should have gone to influxdb v1.0 documentation phofhyperlink instead of 404 page phofhyperlink
database dropdown populated with single database in step 1, able to query it
the count of all individual datapoints is returned for each measurement.
limit with small value or grabbing the last two minutes of a large series should not consume large amount of memory
i'm not sure what i'd expect the query in step 2 to return; in a bare `select * from measurement` query influxdb returns all series so how would it paginate through series if it returns all of them by default?
i might expect to see an error about requiring an `slimit` clause.
i'd expect the query in step 3 to return what i get in step 4.
i'd expect the query in step 2 to return an error about needing `limit` or maybe the output below: phofcode
the cli commands are executed on the influxdb server, and queries are seen in the influxdb container logs.
[what you expected to happen] in 0.9.6 the query result is : `{ "results": [ { "series": [ { "name": "xxxxxxx", "tags": { "host": "host1" }, "columns": [ "time", "value" ], "values": [ "timexxxxxxxxxxxxx", 24 ] ] }, { "name": "xxxxxxx", "tags": "host": "host2" }, "columns": "time", "value" ], "values": "timexxxxxxxxxxx", 0 ] ] } } }`
i expected to see a single series when included `slimit 1` in the query without `group by *`.
[what you expected to happen] phofcode
i would have expected to get the same results for `show tag values on pluto with key=tagtag` and when i used `pluto` and ran `show tag values`.
this operation should run inside `ngzone` without necessarily forcing it.
ioninfinite in ion-infinite-scroll should be called when the user scroll to the bottom of the page.
the play store release apk should show the custom border color.
the `ios` mode to work the same in chrome and safari.
when using router to navigate between pages i expect the page containing the link to be unmounted.
we must be able to set the page as rootpage so that pressing back button wont go back to previous page.
navigate back without showing child tab page.
i expected to be able to import ionic 's react components in a next.js app without build errors : phofcode
ion-back-button should only be concerned with current ion-nav it resides in (it should only trigger ion-nav pop).
it should generate a release unsigned `apk` like : (this was the case until `5.4.6`)
color should changed based on background color on ios view: (on chrome) same as android 10 on essential phone phofurl elements on chrome: phofurl
the absolute divs should remain over top of the canvas even after the popover.present() function is called.
from testing, the disappearing happens only when the popover is actually presented, not during popover creation.
it happens with both ios and md modes when calling popover.
this isn't an issue at all on iphone or android, only on ipad with ios 13, which has a new desktop browsing engine.
it also doesn't happen on ionic 4.4 with ng 7. it happens both in native version and web-based pwa through safari.
this is part of a complex project with document annotation features... i've spent about 10 hours troubleshooting it and i'm having trouble recreating this issue in a standalone repo.
i'm wondering if something changed in overlay transition function (utils/overlay?)
that might be causing this unusual behavior.

able to make multiple changes.
the outlined button should have the left and right border.
the label shall be displayed with small font upper
get the currently selected tab.
no warnings would be displayed.
this becomes more pervasive as the test suite grows.
i see this warning numerous times throughout my real apps.
why is it there and how do we remove it?
is the generator setting up tests incorrectly?
these components should accept a ref.
the types, and the implementation support all four events.
shadow elements should have the 'parts ' attribute as well as the usage of new variables as in #19893
setting mode of 'ios' or setting the phofcode type attribute to 'reveal' or 'push' may change the behavior/appearance of the phofcode and phofcode , but they should still work.
if the option emitevent: false, ionchange must not run .
the text of the button should be always visible.
select label and value should align at the baseline.
setting the value of an `ion-input` should accept any string and update accordingly.

clicking the back button takes you back to the last url in the history.
inner circle should adapt to the respective height also by some way can i make toogle look like this?
the "to" value should always be the same, no matter how quickly the item is dragged to that position.
the ion-back-button should only be animated if its used in the start slot.
it works the same way no matter if its normal scrolling or overscrolling.
the drag event should consider the document zoom to correctly calculate the drag distance
the classname `"dark"` should be added to my action sheet.
it would be great if a useful error message could be thrown.
especially for new users getting started, it's easy to miss how the components depend on others.
it should not throw could not find cordova.js script tag.
plugin loading may fail error
the toast element should reappear when the isopen attribute is set to true.
virtual scroll displays gray colored vertical scroll bar on ios13
running application without exceptions and blank screen.
support for android 5.1 and 6.0.

while in the login page the side menu is disabled.
while anywhere else it is enabled.

when we navigate back using history.goback it should show pop animation instead of push.
background shouldn't scroll if an action sheet is present.
the icon should be displayed on android too.
html canvas should show same content no matter the way it is built.
i couldn't find any other meaningful way to pin my toolbar to top of the content, so that it doesn't scroll.
and since i pulled my layout straight from the docs, i assume it should animate like all the other pages, e.g.
`iontoolbar` should animate just like the `ioncontent`.
`ionviewdidenter` should also fire on the first page appearance.
fill the div.select-text as soon as the select's value is set.
this bug leads to users thinking they have not filled in the select yet, even if they did.
on application load, the ionic/core tabs.entry.js file code is executed.
the list of tabs is retrieved using the 'ion-tab ' selector which is not part of ionic 4.
the image should be shown properly
a) the user can apply a css class to the button inside of the toast.
styles can then be applied to the element based on the css class.
or b) the user is not able to add a css class to button inside of toast element and (ideally) additional css variables are exposed through ion-toast element similar `--button-color` variable allow controlling button styles.

the current scroll position does not change and user can continue scrolling down.
icons be displayed by setting up `name` property, like `<ionicon name="star" slot="start" />`
if access another page, `collapsible large titles` is work.
somehow, it would be possible to have a header above the tabs when the `iontabs` slot is set to `top`
it should pop the page and back to main page after the fullscreen mode
when releasing the picker column while holding still it should select the closest picker option, similar to the default ios behavior.

on android it looks like this: phofimage
cursor is visible on focus.
no flash of previous page after page-back animation
text inputs should render nothing when their value is `null` or `undefined`
the browser has to catch the on scroll event and hide the status bars.

screenshot at 17 35 10 phofimage
the menu should be visible after opening it and navigating to a page and back.
should ignore attributes with an assigned value.
navigate to new component and unload old component.
a mouseevent emitted from a component's onclick should be compatible with the 'event' prop on ionpopover.
it should not show first image
for example, setting the slot position to top from a variable in a component, the tab bar should be on the top.

the content should be pushed down by the safe-area amount.
change the layout of the segment menu depending on the `mode` property.
scrollassist work at page moved by push.
all pages of the swiper should be accessible
component containing "<ion -tab>" renders no matter what.
the opened page has a back button.
i expect to be able to reliably reorder custom components with full animation support.
should generate .xcarchive after build succeed
but by the docs phofhyperlink it should be `number` or `rangevalue` (`number | { lower: number; upper: number; }`)
during the build the for reference should also be replaced
when i select 'cancel ' button, i want ion-datetime to display the original value.
url should be available or made available via `rootparams` in an `ion-nav` element perhaps?
props should be populated in the child element via the route params.
so any child components attached to a child route should inherit its parent route props.
using a property with name `mode` should also work in production mode or at least behave in the same way as the development mode.
in case `mode` shall stay a reserved name there should be a build error or warning.
platform behavior would be same for desktop browser and device browser i.e.
platform should detect proper list of platforms from platform.platforms() phofhyperlink and should not list out "tablet" platform for desktop browser.
user should be able to scroll vertically without getting stuck.
support for it as it has been released since early september.
the toast bar is appearing with proper text without error.

styling works properly on ie11.
the only page rendered should be the first route that matches the url.
falling through should not happen in that case.
virtual scroll height should remain the same
ionic menu should have backdrop
window should resize before opening the alert, so that no blank space appears and also ion-virtual-scroll can calculate content size correctly.
should not show wrong image, instead should be empty image until the image is loaded
the `ion-app` element should be correctly resized when alert input is focused.
i create a quick hack to demonstrate that reflow the `ion-app` fix the issue: phofcode phofimage
the view beneath should be unaffected
standard html `button`s created with `type="submit"` will automatically attempt to submit the form when the user presses "enter" in an input field.
for accessibility, `ionbuttons` inside a form should do the same.
the `ionlabel` component should accept the `htmlfor` property and when provided, it should generate an html label with the `for` property to be associated with an input field with that same `id`.
the options should be supported or alternate solution provided.
when clicking on a fab button the activated property updates to the current state and the templates condition updates accordingly.
it should close the video full screen and go back to the previous screen.
<!-- if you are able to illustrate the bug or feature request with an example, please provide a sample application via one of the following means: a sample application via github stackblitz ( phofurl ionic angular stackblitz: phofurl plunker ( phofurl
it should dismiss when calling setshowloading(false); after http fetch
the searchbar component back icon (android only) should be the same as the custom back icon.
we expect the same performance for all the interfaces available in ion-select.
the component should be loaded and displayed if the route changes.
the same rendering speed and behavior as ios which doesn 't have any problem.
there should be an animation when going back.
the selected binding should work, with or without, the delay.
sliding should still be possible on all <ion-range> items in the list after reorder.
<ion-input> to be responsive/work when using google places autocomplete.
i believe that when an app is in a rtl direction mode, then an ion-fab positioned at a horizontal "start" should be on the right side of the screen.
show landscape when on landscape and show portrait when on portrait.
debug and release builds should be consistent
i am unable to slide the item when toggleing the ion-item inside it.
when i click on the map, the slides css should change and move downward.
`ion-tab-bar` doesn 't stay in the middle of the screen.
the rendering of the ion-content / ion-slides or any element should not be impacted by the delay of rendering of the ion-tabs or the keyboard toggle issues.
all buttons should display there
i should correctly show the css of the button, i don 't know if any of the console errors affect the operation of application
it should render all the text correctly without tap
the touch events should fire immediately after finishing scrolling.
same behavior if prerendered or not.
seamless and smooth swipe back navigation on ios with proper transitions.
segment button is checked initially
i would expect the modal to display without any animation.
the ionic app should resize on google chrome.
when i click on menu 2 'back ' button to return to menu 1, it returns and shows the first menu correctly, then we can click on 'go to menu 2 ' etc.
not to be stuck in an infinite loop.
all clickable ion-items should have a ripple effect.
no need for the ion-ripple-effect element.
if an item has a href attribut, it works.
this should also work for click-event etc.
if there is a case, you really do not want the ripple-effect on a specific ion-item with click-event, you should pass an attribute option.
but by default, every clickable item should have this material button feedback.
ion menu should close when clicking the backdrop.
i am not entirely sure what should be expected since obviously the font could reach too big of a size to display, but there still is room in many cases before ellipses are displayed, so perhaps use the available room?
or maybe hold the font size steady if possible (though the android font scaling does not seem to work that way as font size does actually stay same in css, so
ion-virtual-scroll should react to screen resizes even if its page is not the active one.
the tab should either switch to the newly long pressed tab or the current one should still be active ignoring the long pressed tab and only one single active color should be present.
when i use `animationdirection: 'back'` within a root navigation, the view should be animated like a back-navigation.
the component should not break.
i expect to see that the page i 'm leaving is removed from the route history and that the hardware back button is disabled when there is no route history.
it should dismiss when calling setshowloading(false); after http fetch
spinner stays in place even with absolute positioning
defining a gesture on an item should not break scrolling within a virtual scroll list.

i can input a date or time on an ipad pro.
the color attribut of `ion-card` should also affect to the background-color.
and the text color in contrast.
ionic textarea with autogrow must scroll to key input position,
the dropdown option should positioned to it earlier position
android: there should be footer above the keyboard on android platform.
ios: keyboard cursor definitely should not overlay form validation.
both: when keyboard is opened the content should be at least scrollable.
function 'keyboarddidshow ' should be fired when keyboard is shown.
i tried only on android and this is not working in landscape orientation.
i hope that the gesture slide back can work normally.
the clear button color must match the color set
the component should not change am/pm without user input, or at least have an option to disable this behavior if intended.
the background of the ion-toggle should be the color defined by the --background color variable.

in the previous beta versions (tested up til 0.0.7), there were animations.
smooth transition without the jump.
animation to works properly as on ionic 4.7.4

if by some reason, the `ionmodal` component is not rendered anymore, the frame becomes hidden or removed from the dom.
lab should work even with scss warnings
multiple `iontoast` components should appear one after the other and not overlap.
`iontoast` component should at least have a mode to display inside a custom wrapper component to have more control over its position;
passing false to ion-reorder-group 's complete should reset the position of the dragged ion-reorder component to its pre-dragged state.
intellij idea (ide) should stop complaining about the issue.
react wrappers should pass attributes along to the custom element.
the popover should be centered vertically
web components should incorporate all styles of parent components.
the problem for me: not incorporating the appcomponent style break all my web components.
ion-toolbar does not overlap with status bar
the link to the react readme file exists and is properly linked to.
same stackblitz but using `@ionic/react` 0.0.6: phofurl i expect there to be view transitions when you click the login button.
did i miss something during the migration or is there a bug?
as of @ionic/react@0.0.7, 'class ' and 'classname ' could both be used interchangeably.
the screen should be load as fullscreen
scrolling must continue until 1000 elements been diplayed phofcode phofcode ` $ionic info: phofcode
it should display the sanitized url, the same as the `htmimageelement`.

<img width="298" alt="screen shot at 18 31 18" src=" phofurl
it should build the apk or aab bundle file and pass check from google play.
the viewport resizes as per visible screen when keyboard opens up.
as you can see in the screenshot , the login form is vertically centered and it has been working flawlessly before this recent chrome update before phofimage
the loading animation should dismiss on android 's ionic devapp, just as it does on ios.

if there is a tab-bar under the footer, the padding-bottom should only be applied on the tab-bar.
drag & drop should work
ipad should show ios ui elements
the application starts and displays the home page on android 5, 5.1 and 6.
expected behavior would be being to open and close a modal and after that open another and repeat

navigating through the same app in android and ios should always include page transitions, regardless of client platform.
the options should be passed correctly while maintaining default behavior when not overriden.
no sha value for style csp changes.
ide should be aware of the property so it can be used in an action sheet.
- if my url contains a route, refreshing or accessing a bookmark shouldn 't crash ("not found"), it should rather display the right page/component/route.
- prod and prod release should both work
sample app shows and works as on desktop
the spinner should still rotate
the scroll animation would be smooth, having a bouncing effect from the edge as expected on ios devices
the knob of the ion-range should only change position if i tap the slider, or drag along the slider.
it should be unaffected if i just happen to touch the slider while doing a vertical swipe, since intent is clearly to scroll down page, not to interact with slider.
this is in line with how native apps function.
when sliding an `<ion-item>` within `<ion-item-sliding>`, i expect the only element that moves is the one i slide.
i should be able to click * on * the buttons/links and not * below * them to activate them.
for the appflow deploy updater to work regardless of wifi network type.
it should be clear and crispy.
if i type in `this is a test` i expect the output to be the same.
it should compile and run.
it should be able to import the component from the library without an error.
when the property is bound to the view and the "hardware back button" is subscribed the view should update its properties after subscribed event occured.
i expect to do as it says, and justify the _content_ within each column in the row.
`ion-datetime` should respect an dynamically changed `mode` attribute.
`<ionselect>` should provide the same behavior as when `multiple` attribute is not used.
the content should be fullscreen (expand behind the footer)
create out of the box app with no changes.
compile via cordova and run on device should work like normal with no errors.
every time a bound variable value changes the page should re-render.
this happens when the page is not placed in `ion-tabs`

the image should be shown immediately
it should work like `4.5.0`.
cordova plugins and platform can be injected in app_initializer factory without side effects.
to accept 'top ' as a valid location as it says here phofhyperlink
enter "32.5" without clear input.
it works with @ionic/angular 4.5.0
content (and iframe) should fill the area between header and footer tabs always.
i also did steps to reproduce using _blank_ starting template, and even though i imported
it used to work correctly with ionic 4.1 or something (don 't remember the exact version).
the slider should stop at the size of the items-option image phofimage
it should be possible to navigate from tabs to pages listed as subpages inside the `tabs.router.module.ts` file with router transition animations and back button support oob.
router links should continue to work even after the outlet/route they refer to has been navigated to and subsequently deactivated.
create project 'appname ' with
increase the speed of the speed page switch
can increase the speed of the speed page switch?
should return `ipad` and `tablet` and no `iphone` in the list, and the `is()` check should then return true.
the ripple-effect must be removed by onmouseout or should be activated on-click only (better behavior).
since `platform.resume` type of events come from the `@ionic/angular` package, i would expect them to be wrapped in a zone so that not everyone has to wrap it themselves.
especially since `platform.ready()` is wrapped in a zone, i really don 't see why `platform.resume` should not.
the scroll should work when the keyboard is visible.
when you move the slider and then leave the knob it should call the function directly.
ios can type non-english input correctly in ionic input.
the cursor should stay at the end like in every other platform.
the `ion-range` should work as expected when the menu component is pushed onto the map when then user enters street view
visiting a url should match to a route with that url.
to correct the positioning i have to change the values of popover-content: from: phofcode to: phofcode

the spellcheck is placed at right position.
they should not have a massive gap (was working fine in 4.5.0) screen shot at 8 17 17 pm phofimage
when adding additional slides, slides component should be updated to properly display those added slides.
the slides should be updated to reflect the correct number of slides, without causing any errors.
the selection box should be centered vertically similar to ion-input and ion-datetime
in this scenario, a list item should not have a red outline after un-sliding it.
to have an even margin
the `ion-select` should just take any available space, just like `ion-input` does.
it is somewhat fixable by setting in css: phofcode but it should by default just expand
ion footer should be shown image phofimage
the ion-input ion-searchbar should work normally with the different language inputs.
to trigger the event and listen to mutations
this should work or at least be documented that it is not supported, but i don 't see why it wouldnt work.
the idea is that i want the pages to have `/settings` for example instead of having `/tabs/settings`
i would expect the popover radio options to be updated to match the ion-select-options.
when a page is reused and it 's url changes, stackcontroller should update it 's url value
the textarea should reset to the height specified by `rows` or just 1 row.
the back button should not dissapear
the path of the icons shall be relative to the index.html.
ioninfinite in ion-infinite-scroll should be called when the user scroll to the bottom of the page.
prepend the base-href value to the get request when fetching icons: phofcode

able to inspect ionic 4 app on ios 12.3.1 device via chrome - i see webview content, source code etc in devtools window.
text should show up normally when typing in input fields.
i would expect that the ion-tab-button is recognized as selected.
it should display the image like it does in the browser
`ion-item` with `(click)` attribute have `ion-activatable ion-focusable` class
following the example above, i will expect the query params to be preserved when navigating back to the latest active view on tab a.
it should appear correctly on both safari and chrome.
`ion-refresher` should be visible when dragging content down, even if `content` has a `fullscreen` attribute.
the vertical scroll bar should not appear if the page content fits in the viewport
to be able to reassign a variable
per the documentation it should open the
as in _v.4.5.0_ the button should be displayed with an opacity of _0.5_
i was hoping isopen would respond to a boolean prop, and hide/show the ionloading ui component.
if this is not how the component is meant to be used i.e a duration is required etc, then it would be good if it could be adapted to this situation.
or i could be missing something here, if so, apologies for raising the issue.
the parent *should not* be responsable for child disability.
the app should not crash.
please execute the following command.
up to v 4.4.0 was displayed as below.
screen shot at 13 32 15 phofimage
phofcode this should behave like ios, falling back to a step color.
should be able to load ionicons.
this was working perfect when @ionic/angular@4.5.0. we had to downgrade to 4.5.0 :c
sample app runs without error
add pushed slide item to the end of the slides.
can create overlaycontroller instances with no options passed in
it is expected to do nothing when tapped like on other platforms.
clicking back button navigates to page which was active before we navigated to tabs.
ionic build/cordova prepare should add desired file including index.html to www folder which is not happening fo rreact-ionic app.
fast navigation should not bring the ion-router-outlet in a race condition.
the app should navigate without reloading
if it is, this behavior should be documented.
there should be no active indicator at the top
app should load and run instead of crashing.
navcontoller.pop() should be able to navigate to the correct page in nav stack as ion-back-button does.
not able to make android application by running the command
i want my modal to appear with a transparent background/overlay
should be able to change am/pm input in ion-datetime element.
should have the layout it has on bigger screens.
ionic small screen expected behavior phofimage
the ion-input gets the background color of the ion-item always edit: in android 5 you can upgrade the webview apk and that solves the problem, but in android 4.4 (webview version 34) that is not possible.
any idea to solve this problem?
back button should redirect user to the previous page which is page 3 in the previous example
the animation goes back like in other pages out of ion-tabs.
on the web, should be false.
and cordova_plugins.js should not be added automatically.
when there is no data the ionic-virtual-scroll should be updated, disappearing, not leaving the last used ionic-virtual-scroll image phofimage image phofimage
that had a padding left to 12 px as in version 4.4.2
on ``v4.4.2`` everything is working fine.
slot="start" and slot="end" should be in the same place wether the platform is web or android.
it works when i use a normal button but i wanted to use fab bc of the style and easily way to put it aligned in the page.
for `hasvalue()` to return `true` if the `ion-datetime` has a value, or `false` if not.
if keyboardresize is set to false, ion-content adds a keyboard-offset as padding-bottom so the content is bigger and content scrolling works.
color of label has the same color during input as without input
when app is opened using "in app browser", it display correctly header, footer and content.
the menu should be closed.
to be able to scroll to see overflow
open any page from any page and pressing back should lead to the first page.
the refresher should not impact the position behavior of other elements
test case needs to working fine
the header should be translucent.
the toolbar should have no border.
show the list of components in a list of 3 items per row
returning <redirect> should be acceptable and pass unit tests.
please make _padding-inline-end_ a variable: `--padding-inline-end`
the app shouldn 't reload/lag
ion-content should respect fullscreen property and take full height and also empty space beneath <ion-header>
this works when i set the variable --border-width: 0px;
navigation options must be always passed to angular router.
back button keeps visible, even if i add text.
`platform.is('mobile')` should be false in the situation described above
when the picker gets dismissed it should have the role parameter set.
when closing via a button with that button 's role.
so we can perform some action based on whether the user clicked the button or not
input's value is same as state.
1. input is handled by `onchange` method 2. input length is checked.
* if `length <= 5` then update state * else don't 3.
`<ioninput />`'s value is same as state
i would expect the color to be a variant of an existing variable that is modified.
such as using a step color based off the theme variables.
predictable error-less behavior for all `ion` elements
the correct tab should be marked as the active tab
the <ion-segment scrollable> component should support scorlling on web.
grow the textarea as long as needed for the text.
sending/receiving data should take place, i have been calling the apis from my browser and it worked just fine.
to run with the command "ionic cordova run android"
should return false in android app in android 4.4.4 device.
have the same behavior on components that blocks the screen with a backdrop (either both work or both breaks).
open and close a modal
doesn 't fail to compile
when i navigate back, with or without animation, the "old" page should correctly be cleared or hidden from the dom.
if hidden, the `z-index` of the new page should be higher than any other old pages.
should install node-modules and start the app
the desktop should be desktop, and detect the device correctly, as what they do in all website in the world and this phofurl
rxjs operators should have the same behavior on android apps
lab should be able to show show both md and ios styles.
that works the same as it works in the browser.
the ion-content ought to resize the same for ion-searchbar as it does for ion-input
when you change the hour field, the minute field should get updated to allow all values.
can edit contenteditable within ion-app for android and browser, but not ios mobile.
open camera should not change the innerheight.
hitting enter or spacebar on the keyboard when focus is on a tab button should activate/select the tab button, just like a click event.
this works for ion-button elements but does not work for ion-tab-button elements.
: this used to work in previous versions!
addition of query parameters in `defaulthref` should not break back navigation.
the element should just stay in the original position due we didnt dropped anywhere else.
have a proper css selector
the icon and the text of the button are shown.
setting the display property of the `<button>` element to `block` ensures the `<button>` fills the available space and ignores any white space between tags.
<img width="335" alt="screenshot at 22 31 04" src=" phofurl
adding aria landmark roles to ion-menu would be unnecessary; it would already have the most appropriate role for a component intended to be used as a navigation drawer : 'navigation '.
back button should appear and navigate you to the page you were before.
i would like the hardware button to keep working after i have had to intercept and do the redirect to the home page
i don 't expect to see doubled animations occasionally and i also don 't expect the app to get "stuck" on a page where i cannot route to a different page or even swipe to go back a page.
a user visits a tab, clicks a link which opens a page outside of the tab group.
then click another link in that page and goes to a child page.
navigation should be smooth and animated forward/back and should not skip pages
expected when i change the css class like this ion-select { --color: #7044ff!important; } or like .select-text { font-size: 17px!important; color: #7044ff!important; } the color should change but it does not
that the parent tab 's view will be updated by changes to properties it is bound to.
component doesn 't get removed but will be hidden.
`<ion-select>` should properly display the selected option when using observables to build the options list.
prior to 4.2, the `ion-datetime` would display that date in the timezone that the value is in: > 16 may 19 12:25 this is what i expect from it, since i would pass the `value` with a different timezone info if i wanted user to see it in that timezone.
i. e. if user switched their in-app timezone to `+02:00`, then `moment().format()` would print that same date as and only then would i want user to see time as `02:25`.
i don 't expect to see previous page content when swiping down from a refresh.
i expect to get the .apk file after running the command.
the .apk isn 't generated as it is when using the release flag.
also, no detailed information is displayed about the issue even when using verbose flag.
i have found some info on some stackoverflow threads about using ionic serve before running this command.
i tried this as well but with no luck.
components are rendered when scrolling down on android device
i expected the footer itself to be transparent and the components on it to stay visible
all unsafe evals should be removed to allow ionic to run in environments with strict csp.
the range slider works and parses number arguments.
ion-input height is the same with or without value
i want the animation to work.
should not disappear as previous versions
ionimg in android version 7.0 can load img
the modal content does not disappear.
it should be clear and crispy.
content in `ion-col` will word-wrap on default.
ion-button styling should match ion-card styling
i expect the validation to fail when the user is below min or above max, and therefor the parent ion-item to show a red border on the bottom.
android hardware back button must be disabled.
data shown should match the respective item.
by default when you add the *action-sheet
the `animation` property would be included in the `ion-router-outlet` directive in `@ionic/angular`
`console.log( 'received a notification ', notification);` should display log `data` from notification.
component should rerender, because redux-content did update.
it states in the docs that 'cache ' is a valid input
navigating back from tabs b to tabs a page should animate.
the event 'ionbackdroptap' should not be triggered within the same press action.
it should only trigger when the popover is fully displayed and a new user interaction happens.
i expect `ion-back-button` to behave the same way as `ion-icon` - see screenshots below.
in an external javascript, like my javascript file `test.js`, there 's no way to access the `toastcontroller` object.
the (click) event should be triggered on the first tap.
all the usual events should be fired when a page is loaded or reloaded upon a url change because data could have changed in the mean time.
i have checked the docs as well as open and closed issues on the repository.
this is a stencil pwa but relates to ion-router.
i think it 's to do with ion-nav stack of pages because previous page doesn 't seem to get unloaded.
... 5. when i call `push()` on an `ion-nav` it only affects the `ion-nav` it was called on.
it is expected that the application starts just like it does on an android device, where the app starts without problems.
what i would expect is that when you use pickeroptions, the format would still be in the iso-8601 format like when you are not using pickeroptions on a datetime, but this isn 't the case for me.
as for non-autofilled inputs, floating labels must stay entirely visible.
can make the sticky work
`classname` should be appended to any needed classes built in to ionic.
this would allow the use of css-in-js which is becoming more and more common.
also with some apps (like the one i 'm working on) we need to easily set variables via a network retrieved file that contains colors and other customizations.
after a secondary style window is hidden allow a hook to unmount the contents so the cleanup can occur.
opening a modal should unfocus controls in the background.
the app should focus on the `<ion-input>` element that has the property `autofocus` set to `true`.
the navigation should happen with a clean transition, not flickering to the previous page
i would assume that the background should be transparent somehow and i can see what is underneath it through
the property `--button-color` should work as advertised
available days should include all days from `min` value day to last day of the month and from first day of next month to `max` value day.
the grouped items should be dragged properly.
it should be possible to size a `<ion-spinner>` without making it blurry
switch between tabs and use the refresher normally without it stop working
after setting up any starter project, building it and running `www/index.html` in the browser it should start the app without any issues.
navigating from '/tabs/tab1 ' to '/settings ' would invoke ionviewwillleave on tab1page and navigating back would again invoke ionviewwillenter on tab1page.
the case of "menuinnerel === undefined" should be handeled for strange timing errors like this and not create an error, thereby not blocking user input
be able to pass `null` to component without breaking it.
i want to click back button navigates back prervious url query param is full
the expected behavior here is that, the images ought to have display after build and the images location in the apk should be something like:
using the markup at phofurl 1. the drag icon should be displayed 2. dragging the drag icon the item should be moving
the buttons would be the same size.
i would expect that npm packages excluded or marked as "external" are not bundled in the final product.
i expect ioninfinite to fire when more items can be shown on the page.
when the user uses the browser back button and navigation occurs, the modal should be dismissed.
while adding plugin, it should pull the latest code from the github repo.
the searchbar should get focus immediately after calling .focus() and the keyboard should be displayed.
the inset input highlight should not take up the full width.
this used to work, i 'm not sure at what point it broke.
as soon as dropdown backdrop is clicked without any option selected, it should dismiss dropdown and change control states without requiring an additional click.
menu can appear by sliding
in all version android direction icon is <-.
first tab is actived and when click on each item, they will be actived.
the label should stay on top when the input is invalid
when navigating to a page with navigateroot i would not expect to see the back button since there should be no pages in the history stack to go back to.
nb clicking the back button does not navigate away from the page so this is as expected since current page is now root page
normally, no zoom in and out of pictures
icon and text should be aligned.
when click on icon menu show side menu
ion-header is transparent,ion-content is fullscreen maybe,shadowdom is not supported, there are many problems with webview on android 6.0 and 5.x.
content are scrolled properly in all the ios devices.
i would expect that angular change detection is run when mutating the data and the view is updated.
should be focus on input and scroll view above keyboard in first time app open
we should be able to style `img` in `ion-img`
unnecessary change detection should not run while each ionic component 's element are created.
i expect to only be allows to scroll until the last item of the list is at the bottom of the view port, not top.
keep focus so a user can keep on typing in the same field they were just typing in.
targeting `"target": "es2015"` in tsconfig.json is safe when the app needs to run on browsers that only support es2015.
the keyboard should not hide after few seconds, because there is no other event of change focus or stop focus.
i expect that when i navigate back to cashed page ngoninit won't be called.
see some color change when changing the css variables
the app should looks and works like in google chrome or mozilla firefox.
i do not have any problems there.
does not float when no value
you can find code here: parent phofhyperlink component that update/ passes property child phofhyperlink component that contain ion-segment ion-segment phofimage @liamdebeasi
ion-refresher has to work if disabled property has value equal to false.
camera plugin should work as expected
it should select the proper tab every time.
being chrome, safe area shouldn 't be added since it 's alreade managed by chrome.
the back button on the ionbackbutton component should not throw this error and should navigate to the defaulthref if no history exists.
remove 'transform ' at the end.
expected behavior is that the footer resides on top of the keyboard all the way up and isn 't moving in steps.
it should render the same as when placed inside a plain div (see screenshot below): sidenav_plain_div phofimage
following an android run i expect the app to start at the home screen, be able to navigate to the modal and open and close it without bugs or errors
the vertical scroll is working
should as android 8 output: "mobile" , not "desktop"
component fire componentdidmount not only the first time
scrollable area increases correctly, according to keyboard height.
i want to prefix cdn domain before all *.svg file which is dynamically generating by ionic components so *.svg path will not be pointed to the hosted domain.
the safe-area should be respected similar to what 's happening on ios
field2 is updated when we type in field1
the component should be able to read its
`ion-content` with `fullscreen` attribute will behave like `ion-content` without the attribute, with `ion-title` and buttons fading/sliding smoothly.
according to this documentation, phofurl `propsdata` will be proxied to the vue component 's props i expect to access the props by phofcode
can set property animated of ionrouteroutlet to false
i expect the text inside the label to not wrap
icons placed in html with "ion-icon" are displayed.
for the button to be `disabled` and the visible effect of the button to indicate it is disabled.
the docs example code shows the `ionactionsheet` with no children.
you should not be able to swipe back from a page where a candeactivate guard returns `false`.
sliding should still be possible if the item is dragged up in the list
ionviewwillleave has to trigger when leaving the page
app scrolls content and/or doesn't freeze
datetime picker should be set to 0 instead of current time when value is 0.
ideally, the data should flow back to activatedroute.data and i should get the new resolved data when the page reloads.
it works fine in a pure angular project.
i would like to show ion-toast on full width (100% width) on screen, i can set --width: 100%; but there is left 8px setting which i'm not able to overwrite with any settings.
run oninit each time i have an app with angular.
it is a simple list of items, after clicking on an item opened item details page.
edit item page phofcode i use itemsservice -> get/save items.
phofcode phofcode in angular application, oninit lifecycle event working each time when i open these pages.
i should edit an item on itemdetailscomponent, and after clicking back to indexcomponent see new information.
changed `router-outlet` to `ion-router-outlet` same structure, same routing.
and now: - indexcomponent oninit working the only first time.
when back to this page from itemdetailscomponent - oninit not rerun.
ionic reuse indexcomponent, but need a new instance.
itemdetailscomponent working the only first time for each in the items list.
but if edit item, return back to indexcomponent, update items handly(click a button, because not work).
and open itemdetailscomponent again see old information because not firing this is old instance.
it should not cause flickering
when using `ion-input` the view is scrolled to show the field.
i think`ion-textarea` should behave the same way.
should be able to color the inner ion-radio using the exposed variable
when pressing in any other components padding area nothing should happened steps to reproduce:
an ionchange should occur even with a tap.
support of multiple and named router-outlets
plugins should work ( @angular/common/http https post/get..., ionic native qr reader...)
when swiping from left to right or vise versa, only icons from the side i`m sliding should be shown

worked perfectly in 4.0.x version
expected is to be able to select all months, and all days for current month when i change year to previous year.
sometimes it works and the "hydrated" class is added, sometimes not.
seems to be a timing issue when rendering the first page.
to be able to access the css property text-indent for any input as it 's common to use when using the input image background
if a multiple-value `ion-select` is initialized with a list of values, the specified values are selected and shown.
show the color from variable.scss, run the app on android 5 or 6.
when you go to import a mixin that is imported into the `global.scss` file, you would expect it to be used globally without having to manually import the mixin file into the component that you want to use it in.
this was how it worked in ionic v2, v3 but for whatever reason, it is not accessable in v4 without having manually import them everytime...
all the instances of the slides component should respond the same the screen resize events.
the popover would be able to be moved around in the code or as a argument throught the create method.
click on menu should dismiss any subpages and show root page.
a functioning test in the browser of the basic app
the position of the pager items should be above the save area.
the texts shouldn 't desappear.
text highlight selection have to stay on the selected region.
expected to work like on safari or other browser text selection
ionic component css styles applied.
should be able to reorder items even if `ion-reorder-group` is located within a shadow dom component.
console.log logs once api is called once so that one loan instance is created
if the slot is top or bottom the item should be on top of or below the label
`ionviewdidenter()` should be triggered any time a page is navigated to.
application behavior should be consistent regardless of which page is loaded first.
ionic & stencil component methods should invocable with expected behavior within at least one angular lifecycle hook that occurs during a "setup" phase.
perhaps introduce a new lifecycle hook, or monkey-patch an existing lifecycle hook to wait for ionic rendering.
i 'm not sure yet, but method calls shouldn 't fail in `afterviewinit`.
scroll position is preserved when navigating back in firefox (as it is in chrome).
menu is beeing displayed like expected.
this should be allowed and animated properly: phofcode
animation should work in all page transitions
all platforms behave in a consitent way.
i expect there to be no animation.
the page content should display correctly
back and forward buttons should work.
ripple effect fires once and completely without any flickering.
the callback should be executed after pop
the fab button should sit between footer and content, like it used to.
this used to work with beta13 and earlier.

enough padding is used so that the keyboard doesn't overlap the footer.
i expect route reuse strategy that try to attach/detach routes to work as designed for angular.
expect the time to be displayed as the local/offset time.
ie also picker should display the local time.

it should take at least twice less than it is now.
i don 't think, i faced this issue working with ionic 3.
should navigate to next page back and forth successfully everytime
scrolling to month (or year) higher than min but allow to select all days of month
navigation back and forth between sibling routes should always succeed.
ion-ripple-effect should work inside ion-item element.
i expected the instructions in the project readme phofhyperlink to work.
when you block the possibility to leave a page on ionviewwillleave (with a candeactivateguard) and a user swipes to go back, the page transition should not have started, because then the user is still able to swipe away the page.
by default, when i click a fab-button in a fab-list it is automatically closed, but if i do it programmatically it is opened again, while it should not.
it should trigger the ion-select on tap and opens a modal for selecting items.
i think ionic v4 should work with nextjs ,gatsbyjs or any react framework
title block pushes up the container if it needs more space ion-actionsheet-2 phofimage
ion-datetime default value should be local.
there should be no box appearing
testing with jest is an important part of any react project and it would be useful if either this just worked, or there was a documented method to work around this problem, particularly with _create-react-app_ which obviously has limitations on the configuration.
it should firing the click event of the clicked view instead of any other.
list update shouldn 't change the way sliding option works.
mixin is applied in production
i expect placeholder text and floating labels to live side by side in perfect harmony.
i would expect this to behave similar to the native range component.
if a value is out of range, set it to either the min or the max (whichever value is closer).
both single and dual knob renderings should update the knobs and emit `ionchange()` when the bound variable is changed.
notice that changes to both single and dual sliders results in logged data.
clicking on the single slider buttons logs twice (once from the button click and once from onchange event).
clicking on dual buttons only generates a single log entry from button click code.
no safe-area-inset-bottom padding on toolbar in ion-footer if there is ion-tab-bar on bottom already.
contrast color of my color variable is set to slotted ion-icon on android the same it is on ios.
when an ion-textarea has a value, the label should float properly.
when an ion-range is disabled, its knob is styled without its default css border.
the api request should works on the browser while ionic serve and on the real android device while ionic cordova build android.
it should not be adding the right parenthesis and not hang.
the `img` element should take all the `ion-img` element space.
click events should work accurately, it should fire the click events of my clicked button or view etc.
it should not flicker when we update the list with the latest data.
the correct navigation animation will be used and the ionic stack will not be reset when forward navigating with the angular router even in the case where a `candeactivate` route guard has stopped a back navigation.
it should open in first slide like in android
ion-item lines should align properly
correct styles on chrome 53.
ion-item should have `ripple-color` css variable
ion-slides should work correctly everytime modal is opened and it should not depend on other components in templates like ion-button
possibility to add something other than text in ion-select-option, eg.
flag icon, custom html elements.
i should not be receiving this error, and `this.loading` should be defined.
scrolling should be blocked while changing page.
no space is added, at least not with other color than specified.
dynamically update the number of days in ion-datetime.
as per docs... "text alignment items left align text and add an ellipsis when the text is wider than the item.
see the utility attributes documentation for attributes that can be added to <ion-item> to transform the text."
if text-center is not a valid utility attribute for an ion-item, please update docs.
the spinner should follow a concise circular pattern, rather than the stretched variation shown in the gif
both padding should follow the padding variable setted
fast and smooth scrolling and without throwing errors.
when setting --border-color: linear-gradient(...) the gradient should appear on the line around the outlined button, however it just displays as the primary color from global css variables.
allow clearing the datetime value set
expect page changes to tab2, and only tab2 is active
selectors defined in global.scss should be accessible in other style sheets.
note that in ionic 3 extending selectors defined in app.scss is possible without any errors, so this bug is ionic 4 specific.
change position of knobs, while changing their values.
when i click on the back button the `ionviewdidenter` method of the tabbed page fires since it has been entered again.
(consistent with non tabbed pages.)
&lt;ion-content>, which fit to &lt;ion-header> placed globally on tabs page, as it is fitting to &lt;ion-tabs>
the alert should be centered vertically when the keyboard is opened because ion-alert is within the body.
i am aware that this works when the keyboard resize mode is set to native but there are serious issues when focusing inputs.
that issue can be found here #17457
input fields inside an iframe should behave as they do in a mobile web browser.
the user should be able to drag the cursor and select/delete text and then be able to continue typing in the text field.
the ion-cols should not have padding, like mentioned in the documentation and was before in ionic 3.
when focussing the second ion-input i expect the view to scroll to a position where the ion-input is centered in the view.
app should work on given minsdk versions.
startup problems should be solved
my custom styles should be applied with view encapsulation active.
this comment makes me think that it used to work phofurl
i have a page in a tab which is an editor for a new item (where additional data is provided via queryparams) which can be called from other pages in other tabs via navigate.
i ought to be able to call that route multiple times with different queryparams and the editor ought to display for that tab with the appropriate modifications based off the incoming queryparams via it's activatedroute events.
it should run smoothly also for android app.
toast message is displayed in the browser.
when scrolling through months the days should adjust accordingly with account of month day length and minimum date.
in the `ion-input`, there is the `--placeholder-opacity` property that controls the opacity of an `ion-input`.
it would be helpful to have the same property in `ion-select` component.
ion back button should appear in the order detail page.
do not show `ion-tabs` when keyboard is open.
tapping on an ion-button (ios 12.1) should show the tinted color of the button.
as per the md spec, default placement for a dropdown menu is typically positioned below the element that generates it.
user styles should take precedence over scoped styles, i believe this used to work.
now we have to write the following: phofcode we shouldn't have to use `!important` to override ionic styles.
it should be a notification with the trigger.
project should not break when using ionic-native file.
whenever an angular formcontrol status changes `ng-xxx` classes applied to the dom element are updated.
`ion-xxx` classes should work the same way.
on every formcontrol status change, `ion-xxx` classes should also be updated.
the angular navigation docs phofhyperlink state: > a note on navigation with relative urls: currently, to support multiple navigation stacks, relative urls are something not supported ideally until we figure out how to support multiple stacks, which may not be possible, we should maybe think about adding support via a config option for apps with a single navigation stack.
at a minimum the ion-back-button docs phofhyperlink should be updated to make this more clear.
i thought i had read though the angular navigation docs beforehand but was only made aware of the limitation by searching through the ionic slack history.
the element should not lose its focus, allowing further inputs
the tab bar should stay hidden as long as the keyboard is open.
there should be intellisense / hints for these classes and theirs members or methods.
output in _--verbose_ : build success.

i want to see all icons.
i would expect that page a fires ngondestroy or ionviewwillleave or ionviewdidleave before page b's 'enter' events
once "disabled" property has been made false, infinite scroll event should start working again, and when scrolled downside should perform it 's default behavior of showing new items in the list.

the color should apply to the entire svg shape.
the transition for hiding the keyboard should be smooth and no whitespace left behind.
ion-segment should be scrolled on md mode (browser) with mouse
i think the --background property should always be respected, regardless of the button type.
currently it seems like the --background variable is only used for some of the button types.
for solid color buttons background is just set without using variable: phofurl i think it should rather be phofcode
if it isn 't an issue just close it.
i would love to see the same behavior on every pages - regardless of whether it is.
it should work nomatter the web connection is there or not.
the vendor js should be static and not loaded.
i can see it is there in the core>ion-slides>vendor folder.
but it still takes dependency from web.
it should scroll to the position i give.
text should show up normally when typing in input fields.
components load normally on web pages even when referred to locally instead of cdn

long ion-select-option should properly size the item and allow the user to see all the text
output the image with the path
when using routerdirection with routerlink it might work likw navctrl.setroot
the searchicon disappears when the cancel button appears
the checkbox should appear greyed out.
it shows the same in md and ios styles.
compiling should take a second or two
being able to swipe without glitching images
an item on a list should be able to move without triggering the click event.
(same as how it works when moving an item up to reorder)
for the styling not to cut off the border.
updating the @ionic/core dependency from 4.0.0-beta.12 to 4.0.0-rc.3 fixes this.
the component should show the correct value.
the backdrop should not propagate click events and should just close the alert
clicking on a button should trigger the button handler and clicking on the ion-select should trigger opening this select
it should either go to home tab, or to previous tab
the user expects to be able to scroll the list without closing.
when creating and presenting a modal view via modalcontroller and navigating by url (or similar) the navigation should take place in the modal, not in the main router outlet.
when a month is selected, only the correct number of days would be visible.
any day in the correct range could be selected.
back from page3 to page 2 using ion ion-back-button, now i use hardware back button then it go to page page1.
i expect to go back from the child page and interact with the parent page normally without an invisible blocking layout over the page.
the button should reflect the style of the disabled property in the correct way.
showing it enabled when enabled and disabled on the other case
virtualtrackby was working as intended in ionic 3, expecting same with ionic 4
the toolbar should have the same display on android & ios devices
for the ion-back-button to show up (and work) when used.
the color attribute should change the color of ion-searchbar.
- content of ion-item scrolls properly together with ion-item-groups - no weird scrolling glitches / flickering
the formcontrol associated with the ion-toggle should respond to the changes made in the ion-toggle in order to update fields such as invalid, dirty, touched.
ion-icon must be show in all platform or device.
changing the css custom properties would have changed the --border-radius of the fab-button
changing the css custom properties would have changed the --border-radius of the fab-button
the loop options are working good
the search icon should remain visible.
ion-slides should resize when orientation changes in ios
you should be sent back to the previous page and the application should not be stuck.
the last row loaded is shown, doinfinite should be called, and the following rows loaded.
ideally during the init of the list, in constructor or ionviewwillenter, we should be able to init only 1 row, then doinfinite should load n rows to fill screen.
since the description of the ion-router-outlet component states to behave exactly like the router-outlet except for the differences for a "stacked-navigation" and for "animations", expected behavior would be that using router-outlet does not break layout
click events should still work after navigation.
for the handlers to be fired when the buttons are clicked.
that the nearest inner `ion-list` `lines` property take effect the `ion-item`.
the row should render ion-select correctly instead of decreasing the size while inside ion-col
the fab button should sit between footer and content, like it used to
queryparameters should be stay using either phofcode or angular's phofcode .

when executing ionic serve --lab, i should have the ability to display the different platform views with a title above each.
like it is meant to be.
no white screen of death.
modal page should only show up when presented.
i understand why the tap events in the right pane are disabled while scrolling, but i don't expect it to be the case in the left pane.
the ios settings app (on an ipad) doesn't exhibit this behavior for example.
virtual scroll renders list of objects performantly.
presumably when clicking on ion-datetime within item, the ionfocus event should fire.
the headings should inherit the proper overflow attributes.
`ion-chip` should inherit styles in shadowed components too
ion-grid must have same behavior inside ion-item as normally/without our business app v3 example ionic3-grid-inside-item2 phofimage
the animation should be same in chrome and in safari.
forms using ion-inputs should say next if there are any other inputs below in the dom.
go should be reserved for when the form is filled out.
app will render without issues while inspecting with chrome.
when using the datetime picker, i expect to be able to select any value between the `min` and `max` properties, without having to close and open the picker again to update the available options.
be able to apply the disable property of ion-segment-button true and false and instantly see the tab css opacity lower when disabled and apply back to 1 when enabled.
upon clicking a tab button, iontabbar.selectedtab should return the clicked tab
it should only modify the padding of the content and not the fab

should work in production build too
slides functional in production build.
shows all the slides without errors in the console
`ionrouteroutlet` should not be undefined in a linux built apk
the select overlay shows both "gg" and "bb".
ability to swipe a `<div>` or ionic content up or down (similar to apple map or waze)

application area to resize to account for keyboard.
right margin should be 16px according to material design phofurl
the ionic app should run.
it should show the tabs pages with proper layout

all the placeholders have the same color.
for angular to be at least minor version upgradeable without requiring a new release of ionic
with a list of interactive components(input, datetime, select) the checkbox should have the same styling so that the line separator does not get applied differently.
input should behave normally after app has started, even if the screen has been swiped.
the last item in the list should have a full line as bottom border the first item in a list should have a full line as top border phofimage
the last item in the list should have a full line as bottom border the first item in a list should have a full line as top border phofimage
expected compile time to be as fast as ionic3 or faster.
ion-input in narrow ion-item should display correctly in firefox (as it does in chrome) chrome: localhost_3333_ pixel 2 phofimage
text only buttons should be baseline aligned w.r.t.
the toolbar title as defined by the material spec.
see full-screen dialog phofhyperlink .
modal gets displayed on screen.
the 'disabled ' rules (opacity: 1) should be applied.
icon should be aligned correctly.
works properly on chrome: image phofimage
expected behavior is for the build to succeed without typescript errors.
getting correct activated route using angular activatedroute service works every time navigationend event occurs and "ion-router-outlet" is used.
clicking on one `ion-tab-button` should redirect to correct url.
all the popover should get closed if it is not assocated with the current state where it was opened.
clicking the different tabs should render the the linked components as expected.
while focusing an there should be a "next" button (in the native keyboard) instead of "go" button (i.e should move to the next form control instead of submitting).
slidesdidload does get called after first time load.
it opens fine first time and autoplays and even if page is cached it should be called
iontabs events and methods should work as pre-beta.17
when clicking the back button, you should be routed back to the previous page instead of the tab navigation root page.
the `ion-back-button` should take you back to the tab from whence you came.
similar to instagram, i expect clicking the icon in the tab bar to reset me back to root and regardless of how many times you click the icon in the tab bar, app should route correctly forward with a backbutton at top left corner.
should show the text "am/pm" or "am/pm" instead of "..."
popover open -> only popover should be scrollable, not the background or anything else
ionic-webview plugin to revert removal of gcdwebserver and support ios 10 again or update ionic (prod) and ionic (4/beta) requirements documentation to ios 11 and leave roughly 7% of ios devices out of support (see link below)
when tap on anywhere in an editable block, the keyboard should always open.

"click" should trigger the change on <ion-toggle>
* pressing ion-back-button should be similar to pressing android back button
font-size should come back to the right size on changing orientation.
i've been testing ionic 3 apps and this problem doesn't exist, only on ionic 4 with capacitor and cordova.
if so is there a way to disable this?
having to double click the tab icon to navigate each time you have just scrolled content is annoying and unusable.
ion-segments are shown in md mode.
cleaner www sources, with only the js, and all the assets packaged in assets/whatever
clicking on one of the two items should open a modal
like the docs say at phofurl this should be _"no ion-tab, just a button that looks like a tab"_ and therefore `(click)` should be executed.
according to docs ( phofurl property: allowemptyselection attribute: allow-empty-selection type: boolean if true, the radios can be deselected
for these lifecycle events to fire.
i expect the button having the same size with or without the routerlink directive.
if i hit ctrl + s in my vs code, it should recompile my changes and refresh the browser page.
setting the serviceworker field to false or removing it in angular.json should then not include the service worker in cordova builds.
ideally, would be nice if the cli handles this automatically based on if a pwa or cordova build is being made so we don 't even had to switch a boolean between builds.
- after the list is refreshed/updated, the elements should still be slide-able.
ion-checkbox should have no tab index and should not be toggled through space bar

after clicking on a tab button i see the associated page.
if i remove `<ion-progress-bar>` it will work.
there are still ionic elements in it like ion-button, ion-header and ion-footer - working without problems.
navigation should not stop working
hovering over a tab would show it in the same color as a selected tab.
lifecyclehook constants should be exported via any of the index.ts files.
i am expecting an animation that slides from the right to left when using the `navigateforward` method from `navcontrol`.
the method must select the tab that is in the param.
`platform.resume` should emit an event object
the project is built successfully
the above example works in ionic 3.
it should render the content of home page
no such space irrespective of screen height
in beta 17 everything worked fine.
all non-existing dates will not show when picking months
all the ion-segment-buttons should be displayed in the toolbar
for there to be nothing behind the refresher when i pull down.
should show header and items.

the updateautoheight() method should be exposed on ion-slides component so a developer can trigger it after view changes to the active slide.
the offset, pull, and push, should work on rtl.
the value should be displayed without clicking the field.
when reset is called with {emitevent:false} the valuechanges should not be fired and control should be pristine.

it is slow if i scroll on year.
this is my format mmm dd, yyyy
i would expect to find a way to have a full screen background animate during page transition.
on clicking on input field focus should be right
i should be able to do something like this: phofcode
can add a border or change the border-radius, as the documentation states is possible.
a click event is a click event is a click event, so fire... :)
i expected it to be readable.
dark on dark doesn 't work.
modal dismiss should clean up the memory allocation
it should quickly navigate to the next page without the background blinking and response delay.
button should be tappable after scrolling in ion-slides
don 't add additional attribute restrictions to inner html tag, i think the hash key use only for [component] > * is better and easy.
ion-menu should be displayed on ios.
should be able to drag+drop to reorder `<ion-item-sliding>` with `<ion-item-options>`.
the ion-tab must allow `[routerlink]="[ { outlets: { 'members ': [ 'members '] } }]"` instead of href, or in href allow paths `/(members:members)`
the tabbarplacement should be positioned in
the ion-segment should be able to activate, even after slidechange().
the height of the --keyboard-offset is calculated double.
the white area should not be visible
the value of each input control should be converted to type specified, for example, <input type"number" /> should always convert the input value to number.
i 'd want to have my first-level slider 's pagination shown and reacting only to my first slider 's events.
according to the docs phofhyperlink , the value should be an iso string, not an object.
i would be able to access the demo source link
modal should inject the component like any other element whitin the app currently does.
perhaps i am missing something ?
protractor waits for loading promises to resolve before checking any assertions.
the overlay index would be accepted and respected
the current modal page should close, but it didn 't
whenever you call the slides update method to update the slides of your app on a screen orientation subscription (whenever the device orientation changes), the swiper-wrapper should recalculate translate3d values in order to account for width change that happened on slides.
else slides will be in a wrong position when changing device orientation and possibly won 't show up at all.
always show icons when switching a tab, also the first time when entering a new tab.
hide lines when `lines` attribute is supplied on the `ion-item` component.
the counter would continue incrementing when _self is used.
instead of showing a white screen, the application should load on the iphone (device or simulator).
.item-inner padding-right show change with --inner-padding-end
the container should adjust to the content height of the active slide: phofurl phofhyperlink
ion-range shows knobs in firefox and safari
both methods should make the same style to appear <img width="387" alt="captura de pantalla a las 10 42 48" src=" phofurl <img width="379" alt="captura de pantalla a las 10 42 41" src=" phofurl
when navigating past the root level of the tab, the history of that tab is maintained when switching between tabs.
no error is given and alert is shown up.
childs of ion-content should be able to use the height of of the ion-content.
the navcontroller should not go back to the root and just navigate back to page a.
as i click on different elements (buttons) in my virtual list, i would expect their styles to update.
the ionic tabs (and other ui elements as well) should be responsive to the key strokes that should activate them (enter, spacebar) from the beginning, from the moment the page loads.
no click should be required as app needs to be accessible for users who use no mouse.
ionic serve should provide the latest version of my app for viewing in the browser.
on ios, when looping, the 1st slide will be displayed again by moving the 3rd slide to the left.
the app should launch properly
expectation is that the component would behave the same way on ios as it does in chrome or android.
platform should fire a ready event
all repositories that i have access to should be listed.

expected behaivor is that the components within ion-content display.
application must be auto reloading with changes whenever i will save them on my editor.
pressing any tab should show the relevant page.
checkbox should be check-able on tapping
`overflow-x: auto;` should work in the item of virtualscroll.
not displaying that white screen, or at least decreasing it's time to be less than 1000ms and not more than that.
that would be the worst case btw
input field is unable to fully display the inputted value if length exceeds the visible area on the application form,
it should just jump to the next part (which is webpack, i believe) and finish the process.
after a value change to the range min/max parameters, the ion-range should re-plaint and place a new array of tickers.
after the `ngmodal` data is changed, the floating label should float, iirc v3 and material angular works.
using flexbox the wrapper could use `align-items:center` and `justify content:center` that way any height or width change would still be centered.
ionslidedidchange event should keep firing.
when playing other media eg.
a movie the expected default behavior is that it continues to play.
reorder functionality should work as it does with
the content.scrollto should stop the scroll if the content isscrolling, and then launch the scroll function.
if popover 's content is long, it should be allow to be scrolled up on ios
the command should execute till the emulator is open.
here is the output of running the command.
ion inputs should be emptied when their model is undefined.
it should not be an error.
ionic cli should be able to run phofcode if there is only one project in the phofcode projects list without it being named 'app '.
if the ionic cli cannot support a multiple app configuration, allow a default app to be specified in the ionic config or take the first available project if only one is specified.
if more than one is available, i would expect an error to be thrown and a message given saying that a entry app needs to be specified in ionic config.
i should not have rename my app 'app ' in order run ionic cli serve command.
passing navctrl.setroot(page, null , {animate: false}) should stop the router from animating
i think having a look to the v2/v3.
docs phofurl and at the sourcecode of v4 there are also other functions which probably at the moment are not implemented.
i think some of this features, like the pause and resume for us are very important.
not sure if this breaking changes is an accident or wanted.
we can use the browser platform on firefox and on chrome with ublock.
app should build properly with typescript `strict` option enabled
expect to be able to add unlimited color keys to color map or at least a very large number
building for production should result in the application build working even more performant than in development.
label should stay on top as there are values inserted into the input field.
url must not be changed after page reload
what if tab 1 is list of book, then book have some table of content and content.
in tab 2 i want to set user activity like last view, bookmark etc.
i want to access stack tab from another ta
the ionic page with form fields to be at the least as fast the browser or in-app-browser.
the exception was thrown after 8 other modules had been successfully loaded and right before my first user module got a chance of being loaded.
that makes me think it is a problem with this particular module (ionic-angular).
should support --root options for custom project root folder phofcode this feature really helpful for enterprise web services which supports multiple apps (pc, desktop, mobile, app).
swiping direction should be reversed in rtl
imagepicker shouldn't return empty array imagepicker work good with out background plugin but when i install background plugin with or without adding it to `app.module.ts` imagepicker return empty array
it should stay below the picture
actionsheet.present should be working normally and actionsheet should open
want to build the ionic app
it should correctly register the menu.
it should work for both environment (development and production)
the `ion-fab` should be rendered towards the bottom right of the page (or containing positioned element)
i know when i complie as an app,this problem does not exist.but i really want to know how to solve the problem
adapt your gesture implementation, to let us set a custom controller over a component where we can pan an both direction.
in this way we can add recognize a press event and add manually a gesturecontroller over component for pan in both direction.
this would be feature many of us is searching from months/years.
if i push a page the events must be fired
on both modes, the menu appears (as "push" type for ios).
buttons in `<ion-item-options side="left">` element should appear on the left, i.e.
when swiping from left to right.
`<ion-refresher>` should work on surface like android and ios phones.
this will launch a real device or virtual device to run the app.
there should be interfaces for all ionic life cycles.
get the apk working intead a blank screen
after upgrade, there shouldn 't be a runtime error;
i know ionic has his own livecycles, but i hope this behavior is only a bug and nothing else
i would expect some unsigned apk to be created.
need a way of listening to tap events across devices consistently.
you click on the fullscreen icon and you can see the video in fullscreen.
video continues to play and video tag remains functional.
after firebase opration is complete i expect the view to pop.
it should not clear previous password.
this feature is used by many other libraries like 1 password.
so those libraries will not work with it
like in chrome vertical scroll is disabled.
the result should be "12h30m" phofcode
i will love to get the guidelines or best practices and then i will write good code.
prod should build with aot compiler
in @ionic/core 0.1.4-9 it is working see screen capture image phofimage in @ionic/core 0.1.5-2 it does not work see screen capture image phofimage we can clearly see the the ion-nav has got the 3 components but if i getviews the views array has got only two viewcontrollers and when i do i got undefined as it is pointing to wrong viewcontroller
being able to select the correct day of month after changing the month.
i expected the day numbers is displayed as persian numbers.
but always get an error message: invalid "dayvalues".
must be an array of numbers, or a comma separated string of numbers.
cli updated after accepting update.
i expect that i have no error.
any file i attempted to pull with `ref.getdownloadurl()` should download with no issue.
allow me to select the current date time ireespective of am/pm
the ticks should be rendered again with new value of min], [max].
after infinite scroll the custom component should be rendered the same as from the start.
swipe to go back would be disabled when configured to be off
while opening a sliding item i cannot scroll
no outline on the sliding item buttons
should have the option to define a variable that controls the opacity of `ion-backdrop`
using `menutoggle` on a page should try to open the menu on the current page and not the first one found in the navigation stack
there would not be a scrollbar since that content is not actually scrollable
the back button would be white in md mode and black in ios mode.
the `ion-label` and its sibling elements should be visible and appear in the dom.
when the user change from am to pm, new valid values should be listed ( both for the hh and mm ).
`clearinput` outputs "x" to clear the text in the textarea, like `ion-input` does.
`<ion-range>` should work with touch screen on surface.
see the text on android
toggle icon should be displayed on all toggles.
it is working properly in `ios` and `md` mode.
popup keyboard, the page does not have redundant movement.
it should not mix up contents!
no errors and a successful build
the same code is correct on a angular 4 project.
ionic 3 seems to output a wrong file object
the directory `/src/pages` is a symlink to `/_shared/src/pages`.
this seems to be preventing ionic from properly generating the multiple 0.js, 1.js, etc files.
even if another webview is open in the ionic app, the components should perform in a normal speed.
or the inappbrowser close() function should close the webview correctly.
expect the page to display using either of the following: or <a href=" phofurl
can we include the readmes alongside each distribution?
maybe that means building them into a top-level `docs/` directory and our `files` key looks like this: phofcode that directory probably shouldn 't be in version control.
another question is how they 're named.
right now they 're named `readme.md` under each component directory.
but in the distribution it probably makes sense to name them `alert.md`, etc.
this makes it trivial to grab any version of ionic and the associated docs off of unpkg: phofcode
when any file in src folder is modified and saved the live reload must reflect the most recent version of this changes in the browser.
i would expect the .range-knob` to use `outline-color: $background-color`.
we should be able to display ads with our ids
[error] failed binding ipv4 listening socket: address already in use.
the world should be my oyster.
should work, or we need to document a modified unit test setup.
ionviewcanleave() supports a promise that is resolved when view can leave.
it should correctly handle that.
it to look a lil ' bit better thanks, dan
the app must run without native issues on the devices above.
the expected behavior is to have the option to have the content of tabs pages loaded before the user visits them for the first time.
[disabled] should only disable the ion-input it is assigned to and not (keyup) events on parent ion-content.
should scroll it to the end of the ion-content.
setting disabled to true does disable the input in an alert controller.
loaded page correctly on call nav.push.
because the component is disabled i would expect the component to not respond at all.
the `ionchange` event should be fired when using the keyboard as well.
the toolbar should always use regardless of the `statusbarpadding` value, so it would avoid the statusbar and notch.
clicking on the bottom border should change the segment
appear only 1 tab button
the button element should display the passed `primary-text-md-light` color.
i expect the documentation to be self-consistent.
the expected behavior is to have the same visual behavior between swiping and clicking next/previous button.
so don 't having carousel for one and fastrewind for the other.
a scrollbar should appear on the right while the user is moving the content within a scroll container (ion-content, ion-scroll)
the tabs should not start showing on the login page.
menu should be toggled when in small screen and should not be blank white screen in ionic serve --lab mode
updates to the web app should be seamless even with cached content on the service worker
to perform as it does in angular
in the cli tool, support extra flag to download required files from local ipfs, or use local archive files if exist.
just saying/reading the tabsbar component 's current name.
should capture and update on changes
the checkbox and label should still be visible.
if i set `<preference value="false" />` it should remain un-overlayed even when keyboard opens
shorten the time updating the content view taken.
there should be an option to disable config url parameters.
as the documentation says, this is mostly useful for testing.
so we should be able to disable it in production.
if a slide is fixed i.e.
cannot be swiped then the ionitemsliding options should show when the user swipes the option.
all items should be showing in the viewport.
(wanted) introduce a callback option to an input/alert input.
another option could be for alert inputs only, to have a button act as "default".
active ion-slide inside ion-slides should get an 'active ' class, so style can be applied without extra code.
text entered in input should show completely.
all gesture input is relative to the current orientation of the control, not the screen.
if an `ion-slides` is rotated 180 degrees and is set to `direction="vertical"`, swiping "screen down" should advance through the slides and "screen up" should reverse through slides.
see example use case linked below to get a feel for issue in practice.
the error should not here.
`<ion-item-options/>` should be displayed according to the `side` attribute.
additionally, with a list of `<ion-item-sliding>`, it is not possible to swipe the list vertically from the center/middle of an item, contrarily to ionic3.
it 's only possible to swipe it vertically when doing it on the right side (the scroll bar is slightly visible).
ionic developer documentation should have a simple recipe type of a guide to implement web notifications based on fcm.
tabs should always be aligned to the bottom
it should update the `value` and show the pin if it is set to `true`
should be able to scroll back and forth in the input value
the position and width slide will change after move the device orientation.
other user (sorry, i did not find the user) posted this code: phofcode but, it works the first time, then it does not work.
actionsheet does not display scrollbars.
i need to use both ionicpage and iframe.
please consider to fix the bug or tell me a walkaround.
the modal should close when the user presses the back button.
don 't fall the conversion candidate window.
when go back to page with `<object>`, user appears on the same position as he was before went to other page.
the only thing that should cause the slide view to change would be the publicly exposed slide navigation methods.
scrolling should not hide elements
it should navigate to another page as happens with other components in same app.
dev build starts without error / missing files.
npm installing @ionic/core and use it 's components.
switching to the next field or submitting form if this was the last one.
no action would also be preferable.
a simple button click event should work and be consistent across the browser, emulator, simulator, and device.
it should set the `ionchannelname` to whatever you define in the `config.xml` file.
in my case, this should never be `master`.
swipebackenabled can work when outside tabs push ( a inside tabs )
when i set up the mode to android like this: phofcode phofcode the select interface must be showed as android.
the popover should pop up (towards the top of the page)
just run the app, do not open application switcher dialog
the 3rd box need to be unchecked even if we click on it multiple time.
ionic proxy should allow requests to be sent to a cors protected server.
i would love to have a bare-bones generic theme that can be more easily customized for a primarily unified style on both mobile platforms (and desktop too, ideally).
this would help avoid selectors like `.list-form .item-inner, .list-form .item-inner { tborder-bottom: 1px solid color($colors, item, border); t }` which is not terribly practical.
also, it 's unclear what best practices are for overriding styles in components.
a "how to" guide for deep theming would be much appreciated.
a convenient way to set it be previous page 's title
the height of the ion-slide will be calculated on the ion-slides not on the device height.
everytime i access the `[host]/#/all`, pagec is loaded, ok!
everytime i access the `[host]/#/someid`, pageb is loaded, ok!
_everytime i access the pagea is loaded_
i would expect it to work like the android one.
swiping up and down does not select the times.
(ok maybe one here and there).
limit the number of displayed entries to e.g.
100 regardless of what the content dimensions report on the container height.
this limit should be accessible as an input parameter for customization.
the header making room for the statusbar.
select statement popup to show the options for that select box
dynamicbullets should be supported for dynamic pagination if there are many images.
when i add new controls to a form, existing floating labels out of the bounds of screen musnt 't dissapear
itemreorder should work with a list of &lt;button ion-item>
the inset should be applied to all ion-item on any platform.
dom should be updated when url is changed
maybe it 's an idea to have this delay set in the popover options so we can choose ourselves what kind of delay we want.
be clickable as is in other platforms
should run as normal (ordinarily)
app can start normal at android 5.1 devices.
an option on the `<ion-list>` to facilitate some "bulk select" ui on the `<ion-item>` 's.
you could toggle/perform some action *(eg.
remove items from list)* via a button in a toolbar for example
image is shown correctly, no resize even after overscroll.
virtual scroll list is rendered properly after resized window.
i need to improve ios app performance.
the code should compile and run.
the first item should be the first option to select.
- back to the previous page
the transpiler ignores the comment and builds the project normally.
no back functionality on the tab pages
should work on android 5.1
it should install the plugin.
when the back button is added, the title should still be placed in the middle of the screen instead of space it has because of back button.
on ios, the fab should move up to sit above the keyboard as it does on android.
before focus on input field: screen1 phofimage when keyboard pops up on ios, it obscures the fab: screen2 phofimage on android, the fab remains visible above keyboard: phofimage
the elements should not disappear.
we should have the ability to add the default texts to the config parameters (just like `backbuttontext`) while still allowing the texts to be replaced on every instance.
the "push" function behaving the same way that "setroot", no blink effect.
the image should appear only once and disappear after app launches.i have tried the checklist given here: phofurl
the first visible element should disappear when it is almost visible on the top.
access ionic native plugins without errors
phofurl shows it properly (since it forces ios scss files)
that the code returns the weight from health kit
the bug message should not be
the tabs should not be positioned above the header bar and overlap the statusbar when switching orientation.
ionic-cli shall be able to process input for issued git commands.
using cordova commands directly works, but i noticed by the way that cordova simply clones repos, ionic rather tries to create submodules, it seems (which failed on previous versions on git for windows with an error stating a missing package.json).
url shouldnot be changed because the nav gaurd in dashboard page has returned false so the page is not destroyed and even url shouldn 't be changed.it will create a confusion for the user if the url doesnot match component.
html : <ion-searchbar (ioninput)=logvalue() > ts: logvalue() { console.log(why) } expected : logs "why"
meta tags should be added when using: `meta.addtag({property: 'description ', content: metacontent});`
run normally with cordova in livereload mode
hitting back button to return to a tabbed page will flawlessly navigate back to the page.
i would like it works :)
vendor.js should be without syntax errors and in pure javascript.
the same phofcode from click from a button does behave correct.
locationbar shows as same as i input
i hope i can use the grid system in a list and respect its media queries
i would expect that when loading a page with the browser back/forward button it would act the same as loading it from a url.
am i misunderstanding how this is supposed to work?
how can i get the default history to show up any time a page is loaded, rather than just if it 's loaded cold from a url or browser refresh?
the textfield would gain focus when the modal opens and retain that focus,
for me to open the modal without the error.
memory should be released after scrolling.
1. on a tabbed page 2. keyboard appears 3. navctrl.pop() is executed (if keyboard is closed manually, either by tapping outside the keyboard or back button)
make popover show up like in the browser.
instead of only incrementing, we should be able to go in reverse direction
expected `ionic cordova run android --device` to run the app on the connected device
the screen should not show any black screen when loading or reloading app.
if i specify input type as "textarea" i 'd like it to create a text area in the alert dialog
from my point of view the page is fully entered, when it is fully visible.
if you cannot avoid intense calculations while entering a page, it would be much more user-friendly to show the page without fully loaded infos than to block the whole navigation (by keeping sidebar open).
my proposal/request is to not _start_ ionviewdidenter until the menu is closed.
problems with this rather simple approach may occur when using split pane mode phofhyperlink .
the `ionic serve` command should reload the app with the new changes applied to the code, however it stops working.
option should show as a disabled bo
i subscribe to an event in a component and emit this event from a parent page (a parent page for me is the main page of a tab).
publish-subscribe works well until this network error occurs.
after this event is not received anymore.
action sheet on ipad should be displayed in popover.
phofurl on larger screens, an action sheet appears all at once as a popover.
phofurl actionsheetcontroller may accept `popovertarget` option to which `event.target` of the click event can be passed to specify where to show the popover.
the button with cancel role should be removed automatically.
the same behavior may also be desired on other tablet platforms like android: phofurl > consider alternatives to modal bottom sheets on larger screens.
because bottom sheets may appear far from the place where the user clicked or touched summon them, it splits users attention across two different parts of screen
button with role estructive should be displayed in different style.
in addition, on at least ios, developer should be able to make the cancel button bold by marking it as the default button as hig states, when destructive button is present.
the app should try to load it again
an ion-button embedded in an ion-navbar should acquire bar-button style classes, even when the ion-navbar or ion-button is defined in a custom component.
i would expect that the transcript compiling process to complete successfully independently of what type of platform i 'm building for.
imo, the displayed tabs should always match the array supplied to *ngfor.
this means that removed tabs should be removed from the view, and new tabs should be displayed at the right position.
changing a route parameter the browser bar or `window.location` should cause `ionviewwillenter` to trigger and the `navparams` to reflect the new details
to be able to show the ion-select no matter the interface type and for it to show that interface type and access an event when the value has actually changed for the element.
this is so once one select box is selected, i can get it to show next, data for next one pertains to selected first one, so it has be displayed after value has been updated.
displayed value on detail page must always update after clicking button.
no extra borders on seemingly random elements in a list
page should have adequate padding to accommodate status bar.
this css rule not to be applied if tabs are already present.
since is not possible to fix the previous rule to not apply when the parent is an `ion-tab`, i used this rule as a temporary fix to override it: phofcode which fixes the problem: phofimage
i want to use a custon (ionscroll) method and dont want the other components to be bugged
it should not produce an error.
it should be able to go back to the previous fields without problems
as can be view in both screenshot, the images are not correctly rendered.
it all happens after ios 11 update, our app going for pre-live testing in like a week.
existing screen components remain positioned normally.
i would like to setup one parallax background that would slowly move to the side as total slider progressions goes forward.
this is what i would like : slide 1 out of 5 the .bg-parallax div is moved 50px to the side.
slide 2 out of 5 it is moved 100px to the side and so on...
since autofocus works with `<ion-input>` in general, i expect to be able to use it conditionally.
navigating to a page automatically closes open controls/inputs from the previous page (or better yet an api solution to configure behavior)
expect to be able to set api options like `mode` for popovercontroller
no error of this kind, no white screen of death.
the data should be displayed in both functions.
can navigate backward and forward using the browser previous button.
ionic v1 applies update without resetting the app.
this should also happen on these versions, as this has a __huge__ impact on development time.
i expect the device to not check the checkboxes when scrolling no matter how long the scrollings are.
when i resize the window on a tab, it shouldn 't trigger the load event of an <img [srcscet]= \' \'url"> of another tab.
the content of the <ion-label> has to be displayed with whatever browser is used.
the app scroll to infput when i focus it in order to not be hidden by the keyboard
same, as in wkwebview: * header/content does not hide below the cutout in iphone x on portrait mode * status bar does not overlap app header/content on other iphones * top margin on landscape view is of normal size (e.g.
top margin should not increase on landscape view, like it does now).
the call of the `getcurrentposition()` method provides a response with latitude and longitude values.
i expect that when i resize the browser, it should resize the ion-slide with close to no delay.
or i expect that i can configure the debounce value.
instant not delayed reactions of an app
registered click handler is called as expected.
is not plugin or ionic version did not follow up ios 11.1+?
when the users clicks on the disconnect button, the storage is cleared and the user is redirected on connect page.
no error in the console.
the ion-input shouldn't stop working after being focused and unfocused twice.
show a scrollable list content
app was working perfectly, i think it was when i updated app scripts
it shouldn 't matter if you have two files with the same class name, if you aren 't using one at all and it isn 't being imported it should get ignored.
or at least provide a better error message.
it took me a few hours to track this down, for the longest time i thought it was some weird caching issue or webpack issue
in the step 3) it should show the new root page with the side menu and `menutoggle`.
my app user may have two profiles, admin and user.
both of them with side menu and the use popover to change context.
a sample application via github phofurl phofcode
the swipe back gesture should work
the input field shouldn 't be editable.
we should have a nice way to guard `ionviewcanenter` on the `[root]` of our `ion-nav`.
if this is not possible, url segments should still be added to the app url
i would expect that the images render correctly without corruption or incorrect repetition.
tabs should display after the list of tabs has been assigned to the property.
expect the gyro to work with content inside in app browser and iframe
have an option such as `ionic start --resume` which would go straight back to asking about creating an ssh key or using an existing one.
it shouldn 't throw the error.
ion-content can work correctly like `ion-header` and `ion-footer`, not just staying there without transition.
nav to the specified page.
i would like the screen height and width to be consistent, independently of the phone 's orientation
unluckily from mobile browser you cannot really lock the screen programatically, feature hasn 't been supported yet - the feature is in experimental version at least when i rotate back, the original version should come back without resets/reloads.
it would be very helpful if `update()` could return a future such as a `promise` that resolves once the update process has completed.
to be able to reference class functions using the `this` reference.
i have done some debugging, and it is relating to the following line of code phofhyperlink : typescript transpiles this to: 0, args)); and `apply` 's first argument, `void 0`, results in `undefined`, hence the above error which makes sense.
the missing byte should be there.
updates to ts files (services and component classes) should be seen without having to restart ionic:serve
the output should include both the `constant` and `env` declarations.
scrolling should be locked at the same time the swipe to go back in happening.
to stay on the same page with updated data
ion-date time should respect min max limits under mentioned scenarios.
i want to call `movesliding` in the swipe event handler, so to have a common "swipe to remove animation": swipe_to_delete phofimage *behavior before upgrading*
the search bar should be visible even when not typing any key
virtualscroll should resize to use the full allowed height and width of its content area even after switching bottom-padding during screen size changes.
both event does not interfere each others.
it 's only on ios with wkwebview.
combination of scrolling and filtering should not result in empty nodes when using the virtual scroll component.
options to choose the icon and a handle click with 'fab-list ' open.
i think of this feature because of google calendar.
${{somevar}} would produce something like: $3.00
splash screen quality should be optimized for high resolution devices.
can a workaround be to set the splash screen size in `/resources` to is it safe to do that?
when searching for a location, google maps add dynamically a list with suggestions, and upon selecting one of these, there is fired an event 'places_changed '
on setting `ngmodel` to undefined `ion-datetime` should revert to empty view state.
app should still work after the upgrade.
it feels like there 's something obvious that my cold-afflicted brain is overlooking, but i cannot quite put my finger on it yet.
i 'm not sure in which ionic version started happening but before it never closed the simulator and reopened it when targeting the same ios version and simulator device; it just closed the app and loaded the new one.
it should cover the full screen with bottom at footer according to apple instrcution step to reproduce: set meta tag viewport-fit=cover in index.html: <meta name="viewport" viewport-fit=cover, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"> use plugin spec="1.1.8"/ use plugin spec=" phofurl use "ionic-angular": "3.7.0"
ion-refresher should not stop working
`<ion-select>` should respond to keyboard events the same way `<select>` does
virtualscroll should recalculate positions or add a method to redraw the list.
should build as per info
as soon as the side menu begins to slide, the current page should be looked or sth similiar.
app should work as it does with previous versions.
it would be nice to have a 'decimal ' type, that is a pure numeric keyboard like 'tel ', with the addition of a decimal point on the first level.
i 'm surprised that this isn 't already a feature, as inputs like price are so common on mobile.
the tabs should change in the footer and the content should be updated with the tab that was clicked on, independent of how many times we navigate between tab sets.
`ionic cordova build android` compile the project
able to use a component declared within a lazily-loaded module with modalcontroller
being able to add a platform.
i would expect the list to scroll and allow me to drag the element below the bottom most visible element, ie into the currently invisible area that should be scrolled into view while dragging.
and vice versa for topmost element.
ion-fab appear correctly over the elements.
1. navigating via browser back/forward buttons shouldn 't break app ui.
like in an angular application with shared module phofhyperlink , shared module is lazy-loaded only once, when the first module that depends on it is loaded.
i am expecting that user can't go back to the login page by pressing mobile back button when i'm using setroot to navigate the screen from login to dashboard.
padding/safe space will shift footer element above home bar
text should be centered in each cell
the input i tried to focus should be focused, as in iphone and windows.
the activeindex of a slide should be the same as the current slide where the swipe event is fired like it is in chrome, not the future index after slide has been changed.
see 'card reaveal ' sektion phofhyperlink this offers a little more interaction possibilitys, since they look very nice on a main page.
it 's working on ios.
navigating to a page would remain in android/material design mode.
when a component is using onpush as a change detection strategy, the default value of the datetime component should be shown immediately without having the user to choose another date
should show the right icons.
a good example the origin tab view generated by ionic cli all four tabs appear as square blanks.
the app should always be running the latest build.
the header should have the correct top padding so the text does not overlap.
when datetime component is initialized, the initial value should be set without having to click on the drop-down.
virtual scroll should render items in dom
i would wish for the selectedtext to reflect the ngmodel value (blank for null or the option text for an existing item).
swiping over the object should allow you to change slides.
can 't scroll when the overlay menu is opened.
on click first pop up should come then only check mark of selected radio item should be shown.
the url should go back to `/#/` after leaving the page.
it should scroll to the bottom if i called
the modal page works fine;
it should look like this (iphone 8): simulator screen shot - iphone 8 - at 14 19 17 phofimage
in this particular case i am using a cordova plugin available for android (not browser) to show music controls when playing audio.
thus when i am using pwa i would like to use mediasession web api instead.
i would expect some information from platforms to choose the correct implementation.
i expect that the following code phofcode must show tabs
same perspective applied to all slides
this delay should not exists.
text of action sheets should be displayed in the same time as action sheet.
should recompile when changes made and save in text editor.
"ionic serve" should stop building the project after it launch browser.
and when i change the code and save it it build again and reload the browser.
do not rotate status bar
users can switch between input fields without the usability-killing lag.
screen orientation change shouldn 't hide the toolbar / content
as i read about angular and ionic domsanitizer should do the trick and is for security purpose but even with this is not working.
a tab bar should be appear in bottom of page.
the content padding should be consistent, and not changed after interacting with the view.
anvato embedded video 's can play in fullscreen on android
app should not leave header trail of closing page.
content should change according to back-button and reloaded url.
breaklines should work on production mode.
it should not show any .
it should be shown as {{user.address}} {{user.postalcode}} {{user.city}} {{user.province}}
1. elements like tabbar and navigationbar stays fixed on their places 2. wkwebview is default but not a must have, right?
all of them should be the same.
without the bug ion-tabs must stay in its position.
it should not have unnecessary trailing commas in the code
if tabs are on the bottom - they should be called out last.
when navigating with an ionic app with an external keyboard - only the displayed items should be part of the navigation cycle.
googleservice-info.plist in .ipa file should be the same that i uploaded in my repo
i get no error because the plugin can be fetched.
the navigation toolbar should have a back button when navigating forward in browser history.
the navbar button should be aligned to the navbar title.
should compile and build minified production files.
running `ionic info` should return `ionic (ionic cli) : 3.13.2`
ionscroll event should get fire, if we use ion-slides in content.
logo.png in stored in "assets/imgs/logo.png"
it should be able to retrieve the dependant github library using the uploaded ssh key.
this is the same ssh key that i used on my machine.
navigating to tabs also fires lifecycle hooks in child tabs.
keep the `margin-top` with the `height` of the `ion-header`.
app.components.ts should always starts before other pages is this a well known behavior or it is a bug?
it should clear to placeholder setting ngmodel to null
the code does not add a judgment to the y axis, resulting in the upper and lower sliding time will trigger
content should not be hidden under navigation bar.
shouldn 't have to manually override css for ion-navbar etc
the example project ( phofurl demonstrates navigation between two pages (tabs1page and tabs2page) that each have a ion-tabs element.
10 different ways to navigate are demonstrated.
* clicking a blue button in tabs1tab1page should navigate to tabs2page with tabs2tab1page and tabs2tab2page tabs.
* clicking a blue button in tabs2tab1page should navigate to tabs1page with tabs1tab1page and tabs1tab2page tabs.
the expected behavior should be to run the app without this compilation error.
they should n 't differ
the footer should display correctly ios ok phofimage
when i move the cursor to a particular item, ionic should actually perform the action for the correct selection.
the usage of the keyboard in android fullscreen mode does not pushes the previous view up.
i would expect, that the columns form rows, as described in the docs.
the item position in virtual scroll list is rendered properly.
only the top-most visible element (the alert in this case) should be dismissed
it should not throw an error.
it should not show that flickering effect.
it should be as smooth as normal scroll
ideally, the ion-img would not only work for any image use case (not just in virtual scroll) but also be using the httpclient so one could provide an app-global httpinterceptor to authenticate img requests.
i don 't know if the icons should be all the same size but i think for sure all the buttons and there label should be vertically aligned
when the user scrolls down, new articles are loaded, and added to the view, and the view doesn 't reload and it doesn 't go to the top of page
ionic cordova platform add ios > cordova platform add ios --save running command - done!
> ionic cordova resources ios --force collecting resource configuration and source images - done!
filtering out image resources that do not need regeneration - done!
uploading source images to prepare for transformations - done!
if i 'm not saying something wrong, in safari these elements should inherit `-ios` style classes
for it to build successfully.
all the videos in the list should play
the tabs bar should not goes up when keyboard showing.
the input and the list-item should reflect the same state.
.getpictures() function to open native image picker on ios
hardware back should execute the registered fuctions
normal back button icon should appear in the header bug phofimage sample app: phofurl
the ion-list should update the position of the item to display its new position.
the icons are vertically centered.
which happens in ios 11 <img width="399" alt="screen shot at 3 30 50 pm" src=" phofurl
infinite scroll up should not executes many times regardless of how fast the user is scrolling.
it shouldn 't leave a enabled state after enabled is false.
the button should have a normal padding on iphone < x and be visible on iphone x iphone 6 good phofimage iphone x good phofimage
ion-input type="text" types the key held down until you let it up and keeps working as normal when you lift it up.
the side area should have `split-pane-side` and the main area should have the class `split-pane-main` and should extend to fill the rest of the screen.
when releasing the finger or the mouse, whatever the position, the current activated state should be cleared
maybe the solution would be the lazy loading of the popup window?
same as with 3.6.0. no extra padding in on to the left in landscape.
the value of my ngmodel should be bind to parent view
this should be available option, please.
with the push for pwa, being able to make the slides component work in these scenarios is vital.
color of switch should use the secondary color by default on android following the material design spec phofurl
ion-content not hidden behind the ion-header
all rolls should be ordered the same ascending or all descending.
for the app not to crash
elements selection/focus should be disabled when swiping/dragging.
in android popover go up to the center of keyboard-free zone like in ios.

the cursor should be inline with the input field.
this was working correctly in ios 10, but not longer in ios 11
when the accessory bar navigation arrow is selected, both the cursor and focus should move down similar to previous versions of ios.
the default header height not changed
css style should consider sass variables declared in /theme/variables.scss file when using color attribute with <ion-tabs>

a clear cross icon or something which also allows the user to remove the current set value
the status bar would always allow the header to overlay it as it used to, unless defined otherwise by the developer, and not have a defined height with white background as the default.
the expected behavior here is that the tab 's view updates whenever i change the tab
a bit of more spacing between the last action of an `actionsheet` and the home button on iphonex

i want to put an item where-ever i want.
when i decide not to reorder it, it should be able to be put back at the same index.
i would see the whole placeholder back, not truncated.
swiping left and right should be much smoother.
i already hacked the desired behavior using a listener to `ionslidedrag` and angular 's `mousedown`.
see: phofurl however, i do not fully understand why this works.
so i would like to request this behavior to work using the native features as well.
the app should run without showing this error.
running the command on prod mode should work as well as on dev mode
i expect the component to render exactly like a native `ion-item` with the following markup: <ion-item> <ion-label class="required"> email address </ion-label> <ion-input </ion-item>
list with elements containing gestures such as press, or swipe, enables scrolling.
i think `ion-row` should ensure that class `row` is added to the final class value of the element.
when installing new .ipa over an older version, no snapshot from previous versions should be loaded.
should run the app in production mode
elements should hide/show instantly when changing the respective variables
when you blur focus, for `ng-touched` to be set and for to be removed, and the formcontrol to be marked as touched, as per documentation: phofurl

@mhartington said in the slack channel that it should be in the center
when an item is selected on the dropdown of suggested completions, the value in the input field is changed to the value of selected item.
the "place_changed" google.maps.event is then fired.
this is working when using ionic-angular v3.3.0.

do not change the screen size
build new version in dashboard.ionicjs.com
the status bar at the bottom is completely removed with the use of a native plugin, or the scroll view in ionic takes this in to account on ios 11.
when keyboard comes up , the footer should appear above the keyboard, also header should be fixed at the top of the screen.
escape key shall dismiss only the first view on the stack.

moving the mouse pointer up or down over the items should react the same.
the fab should be above the banner, as in the first image.
i think events must be fired in next correct way: > ionviewwillunload() > ionviewdidload() and also must be fired event `ionviewdidleave` and `ionviewwillleave`.
in current version i can 't do some things (unsubscribe important events) on `ionviewwillunload` event because it fired after `ionviewdidload`!
menuclose must works with (tap) event like a (click) event.
need ability to increase width of drag area size for menu

i would like to be able to customize my alerts title text color using variables, as i currently do for the message, radio and checkbox labels, and buttons.
this would involve adding 3 variables, one for each platform (see code below).
the picture should be shown regardless of whether livereload is enabled or diesabled.
the thumb slider should follow the input at any control orientation.
specific use cases are 90, 180, and 270 degree rotations.
in vertical orientations (90 and 270), the thumb should move based on vertical movement of the input method (mouse/touch).
need to implement file encryption with "cordova-safe" plugin.
on mobile safari input element needs to float above keyboard
url should be phofcode again!
if you have livereload enabled and you change the code, the pushed page is shown instead of the homepage.

if usercity is undefined phofcode if usercity is defined phofcode
after clicking the menu link and then if i try to push the child view inside tabs view both tabs view and child view should be display but tab is gone if i did that.

instant focus like a normal input field.
- icons must be optional.

i 'd expect them to be the same, perhaps with an optional attribute (or custom css) to make them smaller.
i think it should be ' phofurl after i set the name property of nav and tabs
opened menu shouldn 't cause any rendering weirdness.
for some reason, setting `margin-right: 0;` -> `margin-right: 8px;` fixes the issue, but according to the docs - you were trying to keep "right" as a real "right" in rtl ...
i expect the build to work, just like it does without the --prod flag.
adding a ionclear event would allow doing specific actions when the user clears the input for example, ionsearchbar has a ionclear event that is triggered (searchbar.ts#l333) phofhyperlink when the user clicks on the clear button.
`min` and `max` should accept `date`, as well as `string` and `number` types, just like `ngmodel`.
opening a tabs page by setting it as the root page will open the selected tabs page and also load its first tab page.
in other words: when clicking on a main menu button, i expect not only the tabs bar to change but also to load the first tab from that tab bar.
the b modal should close when `dismiss()` is called.
the base64 image must be displayed
the expected bahaviour is to have the same performance on windows 10 mobile device as on windows 10 desktop and mobile emulators.
for these to be labelled correctly.
i have created a pull request and raising this to link the two.
like described above, if i go back to page a, it should have the same behavior like on the first visit: when a property in the component is updated, and that property somehow affects something on the template via `*ngif,`, view should be rerendered immediately.
expecting to be able to enter only [0-9] values
ionblur event should be fired before dismissing the modal works correctly on ion-input filed or when using ionic-serve
it should change the tab.
the (panend) event should be triggered as we are not "panning" on the element, but in the <ion-content>, as we are scrolling in the view
it should work and display the lab view
the expected were, that ionic loads the 'account/addresses ' content.
not the 'account ' segment content.
if removes the whitelist fallback segments, ionic does map the url right to segments.
$ ionic state restore the most similar command is <command here> $
i expect the page to reload after the platform.ready where i can place my init function so my varaible are ready to be used on the whole application.
nodes count would fall when modal dismissed.
it should display same as: phofcode
i need to get the current active component per tab every time i click a tab in order to call a refresh data method.
they should be in the same size
looking at the code on ion-dev.js:412 phofcode i would suggest the expected behavior is not to register a new event listener every 60 ms.
as i clicked it should not feel like opening slowly.
the icons on the left side should not be lost while scrolling down there.
the following two lines should be added to the import list of components.module.ts phofcode
after opening popover it shoould not allow any action on background screen until closed
when i add the disabled attribute to an ion-item with an ion-label, i expect all ion-labels to grey out so that it 's evidently disabled for the user.
not only the ones that are in the ion-range slider.
every individual toast will disappear when duration has ended
the behavior should be the same when using either locationstrategy
the focused `<input>` should be seen when typing in it, and should be accessible during actions on `<iframe>`.
user should not be able to select non existing dates.
tabs should be generated and destroyed based on the contents of the data coming through the async pipe
ionswipe event should be fired with or without content inside ion-item-options
you can to drag and drop on list.
the navigation should work with both app (ionic header back button) and browser back button without any errors.
when [displayformat] input properties haschange the textshould be update.
this should be the name of that app that you specify in the ionic start command.
like described above, if i go back to page a, it should have the same behavior like on the first visit: when a property in the component is updated, and that property somehow affects something on the template via `*ngif,`, view should be rerendered immediately.
it should run my app on the browser <img width="955" alt="screen shot at 12 47 06 pm" src=" phofurl
1. i want both of them to behave differently.
i want different slideperview and spacebetween for both the slides.
since the image size for both the slides is different.
2. ways to apply spacebetween and slidesperview in css file the way it can be done in swiper using breakpoints
for lazy loading, it must include that decorator above `@component `
the app should not scroll at all or bounce the placeholder text.
if i start dragging an item, move it, and then move it back to it 's original position (because i changed my mind), i expect the item to stay exactly where i stopped reordering.
there are instances where you want to control whether the `ionviewcanleave` should always resolve to `true` when, for instance, pushing pages onto the stack, or to decide whether or not to resolve `ionviewcanleave` if you are popping said page.
say you have three pages: 1. login page 2. profile page 3. settings page if you are logged in, on the profile page, will want the user access settings page without any confirmation, and resolve `ionviewcanleave` without any prompt.
if navigate back, and `pop()` is called on profile page, then may want confirm with user whether they want log out or not.
an implementation in its simplest form would look like following: phofcode thinking about flexibility, i guess it would be better return (if possible) viewcontroller being navigated to, since it may not necessarily be a case of a simple push/pop navigation.
then user can decide how resolve nav guard based on which page user is attempting go to.
but that is thinking further down line.
you can bind to the focusout event.
backstory: currently in a project of mine we have to keep a recommendation bar up with the keyboard while the input is focused.
the blur event acts too late and the keyboard flickers but focusout event is early enough to refocus input element without causing visual problems.
ie keyboard disappearing and reappearing.
the workaround currently is to extend ion-input and add in event but this breaks with newer releases.
i will be submitting a pull request add this in.
navigating back and forth with browser buttons work without error, same as what we would have by using the app buttons (e.g.
show the checked radio after the radio list changed
there should be single instance of each page/component.
#or instance of old/previous pages/components should be destroyed.
should clear constructor of this class after it loads the new page (in this case `somepage`)
it would be better if you could also scroll through the values using a normal scroll event from the mouse wheel.
reordering handles should always appear when reorder attribute is true.
ionviewcanleave should be working on all navigation buttons (including tabs), preventing users from navigating out the current page if some condition is not satisfied
i would expect the `defaulthistory` for each page to be taken into account when parsing the url.
this would ensure the parsed url of `applicant/profile` to result in the pages `applicant.root` and `applicant.profile`.
to successfully complete the `prod` build process without error.
`ion-select` within `*ngfor` must update the corresponding item.
first `ion-select` must update the first item.
the ionswipe event should fire when a full swipe occurs on an a list item.
the modal appears and clicking on the backdrop will not close the modal.
when i click on home tab it must view home tab not page1
create option in ionicmodule config (eg.
urldisabled: true) to stop url changes in whole app

just navigate to the chatpage
i want to stay same page click the button and call process is statusbar v.s.. how is that?
the ion-item-options slide out when i slide out the ion-item-sliding
this code should be working: phofcode
- the common http module should exist here
ionic infinite-scroll is fired when the device is in landscape mode.
a `console.log` output for non-prod builds that says something like "add `--prod` to your build command for faster app boot time" on startup could help to point them into the right direction
i expect remove to work
slides should behave as ion-content, reduced height with a margin bottom : phofcode
`ion-select` must be shown as `popover` when specifying `multiple="true"` and `interface="popover"`
the expected behavior should be the date time picker should select 2018 12:00 am value for time value of
ionic start should create ionic3 starter folder
using nested components with virtualscroll should not make the buttons feeling unresponsive or slow on the page.
need an option on ionic that the gesture used to trigger pull only works when pulling down is done from the very upper part of the screen.that means we need to set a value for `starty`.at this moment it seems a `getter` property only.
<ion-refresher [pullmin]="180" starty="80"> <ion-refresher-content pullingtext="pull to refresh" </ion-refresher-content> </ion-refresher> ``
align the ripple effects properly on the items, or remove the effect altogether.
`$$` should output two dollar signs in text.
that you can click and drag an ion-item like you can in other browser.
(click and drag via the hamburger)
when creating a new page via cli it should set the `@ionicpage()` over `@component` so it doesn 't throw an error of invalid link for those using deeplinking.
it would be great to have an additional 'clear ' button which deselects and resets the select box - this then clears the answer(s) (unticks them) and reverts back to the `placeholder` text.
there 's an argument to say whether this should trigger an `ionselect()` with `null` or `undefined` or include an `ionclear()` output.
i expect the latter would offer greater flexibility.
as with current buttons, you should be able to set i18n strings - so a setting like `cleartext` would be great.
it would be great to have a config option (something like `dismissonselect (boolean)`) which triggers the ok button automatically and dismisses the pop-up, firing the ionselect with the newly tapped value.
i need the same functionality as header back button as shown on below code.
more: when the user hits my profile page(or tab), the user is not logged in then it shows login page as shown below.on the login page where it has header back button and it is working fine (you can see code below).i need same functionality when user hits hardware back button on android device.but it closes app.

is it correct that app.getactivenav() was effectively deleted?
- yes: a. could you plz update the documentation because the method still appear phofurl b. could you instruct in that case which method replacement should be use - no: could you plz inject back the method app.getactivenav()
document what 's the root nav id or how to set the root nav id
there is no such error on before upgrade (v3.5.0)
while select-inputs can have a required input, the validation borders should been visible on ion-items with select inputs too.
when changing the element 's status as touched=true, the ion-item should automatically (like when touching inside the input) listen to the element 's listener and update his own classes.
the properties of my object should not be "undefined", they should contain there real values inside this object.
the slides responds smoothly with `ionic run browser` as it does with `ionic serve`
ion-checkbox on device should work the same as in a browser.
application should just boot and work since it is a fresh installation without any modifications.
values assigned within a ble observable should update the template display variables immediately.
back button in navbar should work the same as it does on ios.
since show toast command has written after present the loader should come first.
the valid days and months should update at step 4
i think the items in the combselecteduserlist should be correctly selected.
if i move the setcombuserlist() method out of the promise, it works fine.
calling the nav controller remove(index: number) function should remove the page from the stack and clicking the menu back arrow should pop current (top-most) page and take you to next page in stack.
either be able to catch the error, or better yet don 't error.
i know that modal uses the `navcontroller` to present itself in the root nav stack, but to my mind the url shouldn't be reset to the root.
it takes maximum 4-5 seconds to hide splashscreen and load module perfectly.
depending on the url you are on, the correct tab should be selected, not the first as default.
output just the version number as text.
it would be great to expand this so you have a detailed view of `cordova prepare` similar to when you run it raw (not via the ionic cli).
if this is by design, maybe a `--verbose` option would be great.
to see the same output as `cordova prepare`: cordova prepare phofimage
`getactiveindex()` should never go out of bounds.
without lazy loading, browser links should open
i expect the signature and implementation to match.
the abstract class signature needs to be changed to match the implementation.
still has padding and drop shadow.
at least the file should not contains any `ionicons` reference, at best `ionicons` should be removed completely from `ionic-angular`.
we 'd like to have a method to give a default value to datetime 's picker when it 's opened, but neither _text nor ngmodel would be updated until user click the picker 's 'yes ' button.
the callback should be fired after the ngmodel is updated phofcode phofcode
i expect to return immediately to the right tab
iso8601 datetime should be accepted.
the solution is to change the regex to allow 1 or more digits: phofcode
as described in the docs, the object user should be filled with the registered user phofurl
insert or remove a view should leave transitioning false and allow further navigation like pop() etc.
$event.target property should be available
- margin on both sides of the line (works properly only on inset labels example) - input line in all the inputs - drop support to inset labels in material version.
the label always should go to the top or start already there.
to stay at the current slide after clicking on ion slide.
this app doesn 't flash back
the list updates it 's layout when a phone changes orientation.
the second tab should be selected.
there should be no way to trigger the toggle or checkbox when it is disabled
go back to the page previous visited.
i would like to use a fab button in any component and it still would be floating like it should.
(at this point i am stuck putting the same logic in multiple places)
insert method should insert a component at given index.
when pulling down the refresher there should be no tap event on the list item.
tabs should be displayed/visible when the keyboard is opened on ios (similar to android)
i would like to be able to add simple makrup / layout to the message: italic, links, bold to make more meaningful toasts for my users
it should install with no issues
since there is already an ionselect event for ion-option; how about an iondeselect?
or even just an all-encompassing ionclick?
i 'd just like to be notified when changes happen * before * they 're saved so i can manipulate the options while the selection (alert) window is still open, eg.
applying, (and subsequently clearing), an "all" selection.
the hardware button should behave same as the soft back arrow on the app
we have a form with selects and then inputs.
the user can use the form and fill the fields.
but if the user fill a input text the app shows keyboard with go key.
then user type your data and push go, app jumps to next input text.
it should work just as documented, no questions here.
urls remain as they are intended and not routed to another with the extra 'nav/n4 ' ( or alternative).
or there be a way to turn off this.
ionic info: global packages: @ionic/cli-utils : 1.4.0 cordova cli : 6.5.0 ionic cli : 3.4.0 local packages: @ionic/app-scripts : 1.3.7 1.4.0 1.3.1 cordova platforms android 6.1.2 ionic framework ionic-angular 3.5.0 system: node v7.9.0 os windows 10 xcode not installed ios-deploy not installed ios-sim not installed npm 4.2.0 on a sidenote but relative to this, i just created a new sidemenu project, added a deep-linked homepage ( with @ionicpage ) to the sidemenu list and it works.
but, if i go directly the url eg: phofurl it does load and errors with: get phofurl 404 (not found) refreshing the page also does load with same error.
deeplinking seems have been rendered useless.
the selected value (id) should be returned as a number when it is a number.
should create optimized for production android package
the model should contain the selected value even when the selection is not updated.
first input element should be focused automatically
the back button to be shown.
it should have normal height as standard ion-navbar inside ion-header
all components should support native features of angular 2 or be specified in the documentation that this is not supported and steps should be provided on how to avoid this issue.
ionic updated in global packages
using the ion-input on it 's own will work.
sometimes you might want the function of the ion-input without the styling of ion-item
for example with a config property which disables/hides the url.
in my opinion this is really important because if someone wants to publish their app as pwa but the deeplinker does not work well with their nav-structure the user-experience will be even worse as with deeplinks.
it would generate a new page.
tabs should be hidden and the back button present.
for every token i should se a sent message thanks in advance!
in older version we used before we reject the promise for the guard, and the redirection was always working.
now if we reject the promise setroot doesn 't work, so we have to resolve promise, so user theoretically can access page and will be redirect in same moment to new page.
so imo there are three possibilities: 1) this is a bug and should not by design.
2) there is a better way redirect user to forbidden page and also guarantee user can not access page 3) this is by design, but imo it 's a little bit confusing as wrote i think this behavior changed after refactoring lazy loading, but this would be a
no error should occur on building process.
consistent behavior, padding bottom for content
when a modal is being closed (by viewctrl.dismiss()), the callback modal.ondismiss() should be invoked when the modal "disappear" visually.
ion-refresher work in individual segment
i would expect the input to not accept more characters than the max lenght when the virtual keyboard is open.
like in the browsermode, click and navigate without delay
works with of it 's container page.
filtered items updated real time when input changes.
as we can see on the official documentation
the virtual scroll list must behave like a normal list and refresh the view when the array of datas is changing.
should have scafolded a new project automatically.
searchbar should not activate focus after cancel was clicked.
to get the option selected correctly according to the model.
ionswipe event should be fired with or without content inside `ion-item-options`
all attributes of each component should be documented
videos should work even with more than 16 plays.
the button should swap to the other one as soon as the isloading variable is set to true in the beginning of the dologin() method.
incase toast and fab button both are present at the bottom.
fab button should move up so that user can immediately click on button and move forward.
it 's expected to work as documented.
i need to be able to do: phofcode
it should go back to the last page visited (e.g.
the page before `navctrl.push(page)` )
it seems with virtual scroll it destorys and unchecks the items, but remembers what items were checked.
on the destroy it sends an ionchange event that the items are not not checked, or false.
it should not send the ionchange event and "uncheck" item.
this causes issues when list is longer than about 100 items, and any checked items from earlier in list are essentially "gone".
in the mac,it cost about 40 minutes..why?
i would expect the content-component to resize even if header or footer are not sibblings
no duplicated content on scroll.
i expected the app to build.
once a page is "loaded" it should be cached and not recreated.
function should triggered only once on ng-click event
toast should show plain text, links and images properly
i found an issue when i create two slider in the same page.
when i start the device in portrait mode the layout of two slides is ok while if i rotate the device in landscape mode first slider doesn 't fit properly.
ng-touched should be applied to ion-input fields on blur
when displaying hours, minutes, and/or seconds (for example, to indicate an amount of time), the user needs context to understand what value they are setting.
a good example in the ios timer utility.
when setting a timer, the user is presented with a picker with 4 columns: hour values, hour label ("hours"), minute values, and minute label ("minutes") i 'm working currently working on a pr for this
i also would like to have the menu-type: - split (named from split-pane)
should get the current position really quick, as it does with other apps.
there should not be any duplication
i would hope that the option to record and listen to audio works perfectly, and the styles do not move so much, taking into account that the devices have the same resolutions of screens (i will add pictures below and error code)
input type updated and ui for input updated
create a list with * ngfor and animate each element.
i want each element to appear after the other with animation.
the date time modal should close when back button is pressed.
cordova cli: 7.0.0 ionic framework version: 3.2.0 ionic cli version: 2.2.1 ionic app lib version: 2.2.0 ionic app scripts version: 1.3.6 ios-deploy version: not installed ios-sim version: not installed os: linux 4.4 node v6.9.3 xcode version: not installed
the label has to remain "up"
la aplicacion tiene que abrirse sin mostrar deviceready event fired after 18011 ms
no error (was working with 3.3.0)
< ion-icon> will using iconfont and svg sprite
please provide a way to set the default value of the picker.
in my case, i need to set a max value to ion-datetime and want to give a day as the start point for the user pick a date.
but with current framework, that 's impossible.
actually i have two ion-datetime for start date and end date.
so when user picks start time, i want default value for picker for end date be start date.
avoid raising this exception by checking if tab is defined
ltr/rtl selectors to use a lower specificity so we can override ionic rules easily and cleanly, as we have been doing.
splitting problematic ltr/rtl joint rules (`[dir="ltr"] .some-class, [dir="rtl"] .some-class`) in two would halve specificity to `0, 0, 2, 0`.
statusbar padding is preserved when pushing a new page inside a modal.
the virtualscroll list is not shown until it is in correct order/state, it should not flash "wrong" items, nor in inverse order.
just like any javascript standard type, date shouldn 't cause build to fail
rendered component output event emitters should always work.
the list should be updated without items being destroyed and recreated with every search/filtering.
when the list is empty, virtual scroll should remove all elements
_ionic start_ should be able to create a new project without running into npm exceptions.
open browser and start app.
`$toast-wp-button-color` should only affect the windows toast, and there should be other variables for the other modes.
the image would continue to behave normally.
1. ionscrollend is called once the scroll has completely stopped 2. correct item passed to the handler (though if 1. is fixed i can stop the call to the click while there is any scrolling
look the same as in ios 9 and ios 10
you are able to generate resources for all platforms.
background of the footer does not change
print a document with many pages using the native browser print function: window.print()
tapping the active tab would scroll to the top of the content
the weekday should be shown next to the date.
this would improve a lot the user experience of users that need to know which day of the week the selected is.
the phofcode event is * always * triggered after phofcode is set to it 's initial position.
* or * the new event like phofcode is introduced so it will be possible to trace the position of the slider after it loads like: phofcode
normally i for other element in ios app runs properly but in case of input box this issue occure.
build with --prod option should succeed.
sliding ion-options should always display the buttons underneath.
<img width="361" alt="screenshot 10 18 10" src=" phofurl
instead of the delay for the ion-header appearing, it would be good a fade-in effect, just as it 's in foward direction.
the tab page should catch the event so i can act upon it.
the previous slide should fadeout with opacity 0
touch scroll should work for windows surface.
img#changepic can change src when i select a new image.
items displayed coherently with their content.
when using a navcontroller, pushing the view and going back to the main map page it should show the map.
allow clearing the datetime value set
if clearinput property is set to true then it works fine in android this also should be happen clear text on textfield by clicking on clear button as android.
the app should show alert that something went wrong as it happens in android.
or it should parse the result array if any response comes from server.
update number of days after month change
using slidespercolumn in slider component to show multi-column slides.
the video controls should be available when a video is played in full screen mode in a tab bar application.
should create new project and install all npm dependencies.
the module that should be imported is `ionicpagemodule`, which does not throw an error.
the tap should be executed and not ignored.
project is created with necessary dependencies and is able to run `ionic serve` without errors.
it works as expected if replacing space in quoted name with dash or underscore.
i am not expecting such different behavior due to a `--prod` build.
as soon as the day or month changes, all values in the date picker should be updated immediately without having to wait for a users input.
or at the very least should be debounced.
the ion-segment should slide away with the page when back is clicked.
no-padding should override with reset the padding properties.
this is very critical for me, the application consists of two main pages.
everything is loaded for a long time instantly, without delays.
show menu toggle button + header in small screens
wouldn 't it not make much more sense to register the event on `mousedown` and only to the slider container and unregister it again on `mouseup`?
there must be back navigation button
if the type of the variable is string,evething is ok.
3d press on tabs should be ignored
able to choose whether or not to use lazy loading for individual tabs.
ion-inputs and ion-labels would be fully visible in ie11 as they appear on all other devices, platforms.
want generating rounded icon for app.
should work fine after npm strophe and typings
it is possible to set a different "title" metatag for each page, by setting it on the "app" itself when the page is opening.
it would be helpful to be able to set the description tag in the same way.
this feature is necessary to help with seo for web app.
having same description show up for every page is very undesirable in search engine results.
when i click on back and forth, app should not throw the error.
successfully upload to ionic services
-> page a -> nav.push( 'b ') -> nav.push( 'c ') -> browser back = now page b back on navbar = now should be page a
once i set the varible of autoplay ,pager,loop .
it should be autoplay ,whenever i shift from other component.
tabs are hidden on tab sub pages
you should be able to show/hide the modal as well as create/destroy it.
slide.slideto(5,0) should slide to 6th slides.
ideally the checked input property would be bind to the model selected property
`*ngif` does dynamically hide/show the `<ion-toolbar>`.
users can select icons from the phofurl page and use them as a font.
altering the source array (adding or removing items) should not result in virtualscroll rendering issues; scrolling should be as smooth and solid as after initialization.
the color should be the one from the $tabs-tab-color-inactive variable.
the behavior should not allow me to change tabs if the condition isn 't met.
when i typing in ios native chinese input method just get the word which i typing,such as when i typing "","" will show in the searchbar.
should get runtime error uncaught (in promise): typeerror: cannot read property 'test ' of undefined
project should run without errors
on deviceready event, i can see (on my app at least), every cordova plugins and ionic components/lazy loading are working well.
so what plt.ready is waiting ?
i replaced every plt.ready in my app with the deviceready event and the app looks way faster if you do not have a wifi connection (80% of my users).
it should build for android.
after prompting for installing yes it should build the production build.
i would not expect any file sizes to change by much based on how many colours i have named.
the behavior should be the same than a page push from another page, the message should be displayed.
loading should be displayed, then async action takes place, then dismissed and user transitions to different page.
@output() ionslidetouchend: eventemitter<touchevent> = new eventemitter();
i have expected that the virtualscroll resize works automatically.
the height was out of the sync.
it 's expected to all buttons be kept into a single line.
there should show the default background instead of the strange visual artifact shown.
by defining the preference `overrideuseragent` on `config.xml`, if i use on an android device, it should return `true`.
normal switches in the ion-segment elements of the screen after touch any tab.
you should be able to slide up/down ion-item / ion-item-sliding in lists.
you should be able to do this with the `height` animation more freely.
deeplinks to load the specified page on reload on the browser (pwa) using tabs and lazy-loading.
dismiss lazy-loaded modal without error no matter how many times and how fast i 've pressed escape button.
you should be able to trigger events on other items inside of the same `ion-item`
be able to subscribe to `app:online`, `app:offline` and `app:rotated` events via `events` service
provide an alternative ionic native plugin implementation that works on every supported ionic platform 6 document how to perform a similar action on w10 uwp / ie11/ edge
`events` service provides interface based on `rxjs` `observable`s what will allow to easily subscribe / unsubscribe and combine with other observable application wide events.
in order to do that `events` service need to provide a `topic(name: string)` method which returns `subject` observable for a specific topic
the button should be hidden in landscape orientation
changing value of ion-select inside form should trigger form change event, like ion-input does.
it is probably caused by returning the end of childnav irrespective of the page being displayed.
phofurl stacks: phofurl phofurl phofurl
when switching between tabs in `ion-tabs` ionic emits `viewwillenter` observable on `app` instance
`ionic cordova resources` asks at most once for credentials to ionic cloud
introduce a lightweight version of polyfills.js which contain ionic framework own polyfills, for example: *
ios devices should get the notification as well
`ion-option value="true"` should have a boolean value instead of a string value, i was expecting `ion-option value=" \'true \'"` to return a string value instead of the one before.
instead both exhibits the same behavior.
i expected that i could include a ion-range like a button, or ion-card inside a component without needing a special item to wrap/contain the ion-range - this means my implementation of the component needs to not be inside ion-item when i use my component (which is odd compared to other ion-xyz items)
image should show on load
as in ionic 2, this.slides allows to access the activeindex with
works in the same way as without `*ngif`.
flicker should not be present.
the header take the correct height
setting a new min or max should update the ui immediately.
slide properly fitting the screen
content of a page in the background of a modal should not scroll when scrolling inside an open modal just as it does for android
should end animating with some message or exit, i had to manually exit (crtl+z key) as below: phofcode
modal presenting without any error
if there 's no ion-label in the content of ion-item, it should not add one
both the `onwilldismiss` and `ondiddismiss` handlers should be triggered.
live reload should be working and enable updates to html/scss files etc.
to be reflected without a rebuild.
button clicks should not take more than a few miliseconds tho be processed.
css class should be added
every time selected tab changes in tabs component, lifecycle events get triggered on each tab 's view.
i would expect this to just work, i can 't really understand why it can 't be used in an angular service.
to be able to build the application using the --prod flag.
is there some why to to alter the build scripts?
is this some problem with the scripts config that can cause this?
the slider should be permit sliding to the next/previous page until you pan to the corner of the image.
the image should be only rescaled to normal with another double tap.
no error message an the possibility to pan the image.
audio should stream normal like on android version of app.
it should stop natural scrolling, go to top, and stop there.
something like `col-sm-hide` would be very handy.
close button in toolbar renders on the same line as ion-title <img width="367" alt="screen shot at 1 04 46 am" src=" phofurl
ability to see text while typing.
tapping an `ion-checkbox` should toggle the selected state.
being able to serve an ionic project locally over https allow for real world testing of applications targeting the browser platform.
for example, testing csp policies.
for example, it 's not possible to locally test the following policy: content-security-policy:
no click delays on device.
the new version should have been properly installed and the provider, too.
when the picker is reopened the hour should default to 12, which is the value that was chosen.
it would be great to be able to add an ion-textarea in an alertcontroller,
since the clear would immediately done on
range sliders responds to human interaction
click on the current visible page shouldn 't interact with anything on the newly loaded one.
in my example, i have a progress bar that once added to my page should animate from a width of 100% to 0 over 6 seconds.
geolocation plugin needs to work within custom event and within zonejs.
a margin between the icon and the text: 3 phofimage
expect fab button function showing the fab list buttons.
clicking the custom buttons should execute their `handler` functions.
should leave the underline intact plunker: phofurl
specify a side that the `ion-reorder` icon should be, and have the logic work when dragging an icon on the specified side.
see here for an unfinished pr: phofurl
components should be able to capture page events, no matter what kind of navigation is being used.
methods should be a nice to have in components.
update changes just like other events.
the ios preview should not overlap the statusbar.
some config or derective to disable the reloadontap event...
one tap to trigger the event.
same app startup time for both binary build and ionic deploy live update.
worked fine in ionic 2.x
dismiss cannot change url in browser
pressing search button should close keyboard.
to achieve the desired behavior i am using the below code phofcode `<ion-searchbar because
the select control just works.
`tabs` components should be able to have independent highlight locations.
it should 't update the list with new contents
the aot build should succeed
when you click on forward and then back, the page should be in a consistent state.
screen shot at 10 58 26 pm phofimage
there should be an optional way to prevent that behavior, keeping the current title when a view enters.
use case: i 'm developing a web app using ionic and i want total control over the title shown in the browser 's window/tab, which is currently not possible.
the only workaround is to subscribe to the `viewdidenter` event of * every * `navcontroller` used in application and then manually resetting title every time it emits.
a possible solution would be to add a prop either `<ion-navbar>` or `<ion-title>` disable current behavior.
same styles for all input types
the output of the second call of a page should be the same as on the first call.
but if you are on the page and it works, then switch page and then go back to first page, this page does not work anymore.
inifintescroll should fire only once and update scroll position.
the user should not be able to type in any more characters when they reach the _maxlength_ limit.
load elements by id normali
"ionic serve" would complete and not hang at "lint finished"
memory should be released after scrolling.
i can solve the first problem, but the second question i hope you can give me a solution.
hope you can fix the problem.
the ion-searchbar should work normally with the different language inputs.
- [`navbar`][navbar]s should display a back button if they are working on a child nav - child should pop themselves out of their parent controllers instead of logging a warning about not having any more pages to pop.
i expect the error not to occur.
the expected result is that the ion-input field will be redrawn with the new value.
if the model changes, the ui should reflect new state of model.
i was able to do this prior to ionic version 3.0; i didn 't even have to call
well, the component should be displayed.
if the ionic app is running in the browser, it should contain "mobileweb" in platform no matter how i build it.
the floating label should only float when a date is selected.
we should only be able to resize vertically in that case, or no resize at all?
virtualscroll renders correctly first time.
i 'm not sure what the best type here would be.
`any` might be the best option.
when use 'ionic-app-scripts serve ' the select component rendered correctly like following: screen shot at 10 16 12 phofimage
expected virtual scroll to reset when the data changed, like described in the docs: > the data that builds the templates within the virtual scroll.
this is same data that you 'd pass to *ngfor.
it 's important to note that when this data has changed, then entire virtual scroll is reset, which is an expensive operation and should be avoided if possible.
there should be an option to bulk export selected user data to formats such as excel or csv.
in the absence of this feature, user data is essentially locked to cloud db and any external use of this data becomes very hard if not practically impossible.
what if ionicpagemodule.forchild is changed to accepts array of pages.
this would allow us to specify multiple pages related to a section to be added the same ngmodule.
like we can do with routermodule.forchild in angular 2
afaik, should only return true when run in a device as a packaged app.
can this approach also help ionic 2?
and help in reducing size
preloading modules should not freeze the app or bring the app to lag.
it 's not a issue that happen every time but 2 out of 3 will occur.
allow to import one by one or create an helper method on @ionic-native/{class} to get all available packages.
the url will be changed accordingly with the nav push method.
i expect that this should be clearly stated in the documentation phofurl
click event have to be fired once
be able to import and use the interface
if i type something like "ionic g provider db/test" i want that a subfolder with name "db" will be generated if it doesn 't exist and the provider is generated in this folder.
the image `<img can show properly, it work on desktop browser when "ionic serve -b"
when we make swipe to go back should change from one view to another and not stay in the middle.
it should work with objects that have circular references.
downloaded image should appear in gallery.
popover does not need to be loaded on demand, loaded when the current component is open
the appropriate classes should be applied to ion-item in case of ion-datetim
it should create the popover just like it does if the data is not frozen
show the standard ionic/angular popup message.
the `detail-push` attribute should apply to elements with the `ion-item` attribute.
it must be hidden until slide is on their side
before 3.1.0 it was showing as expected : <img width="324" alt="capture d ecran a 11 02 09" src=" phofurl
elements within an `<ion-scroll>` should be clicked with the same sensitivity as other elements throughout ionic.
i shouldn 't get following error doesn 't matter when i 'm setting rootpage.
the focus should be in the searchbar entry area after the page is entered
when exiting the tab (or modal, we have tried both) the audio instance is released, this should clear up memory but it does not.
it could also be that the memory issue is unrelated to the media and/or file plugins ... we have no way of knowing without hiring a native developer really ... whole reason we are attempting to use ionic is to avoid having to hire a native developer in first place though right?
performance and usability in early versions of android, seems a lot of people are still running kitkat.
code works with v2 no error when this codebase is upgraded to v3 package.json it throws error in promise.
app should run in --lab
check for null before calling length function
add support/documentation for the same features as ionic 1 collection repeat - 4 modes of dynamic/static list/grids with horizontal option phofhyperlink .
i hope that in the item show icons over slide thank you, regards.
the `catch` after the should be executed (or maybe the docs should be updated if this is not a bug, and has been changed in the latest version).
when the page loads, the form should be pre-filled out as it is an edit item view.
localhost-8100- iphone 5 1 phofimage
save scss and stay in the former page.
it should work on first click in ios app as well
the same code was working properly with ionic 2 i,e i was able to toggle between radio button values.
unsure what the design would be as the checkbox exists wether checked or unchecked.
label possibly should exist in its minimized floating format on render.
the item lines must be hidden when the no-lines attribute is added to the list
it should only show the right option selected.
i would expect the version to say "3.1.0".
i don 't expect `ionchange` to fire until user action in the template.
and i only expect the value to be passed through because that 's how it used to work.
get a popover when `interface` attribute is set to `popover` on an ion-select component.
current active tab should be highlighted as well as have its icon highlighted as well.
i should have to able to set the page i would want to navigate to in case the ionviewcanenter() fails when typing in the url.
the slides should work as on android devices.
in the component template, it could be used like `<ion-navbar
the textbox should be editable at all times, shouldn 't become unresponsive.
be able to build without errors
the text should start in the center of the input not animate to center.
config.mode = 'ios ' should set the default style accordingly
it should return value for `name` attribute.
able to select the text
after changing model to reflect on html page as well.
expected behavior is a single shared provider is created.
in ionic 2, things are working as expected.
but in ionic 3, which uses angular 4, it looks like every component is creating new instance of that class.
the device back button must get me back to the previous page
ideally this value could be set somehow.
the default value should be bigger, e.g.
20px to be able to see the statusbar.
i 'm not sure what exactly should happen.
it seems the web app tries to show a splash screen or something, but fails.
the app continues to run okay, though, but the error is thrown.
a working scrollable list in an ion-scroll with both click and swipe support.
the model value should be string
the images in the slides api doc demo should be loaded correctly.
i would expect the login methods to be transparent and the user.name / details.name objects always to be filled in regardless of the authentication provider.
for comparison, when i log in at ionic.io dashboard, facebook users do have their name and email in the general details.
is this a bug or is there a reason to work like this?
tabs 's page 's constructor only called once.
each image in ion-avatar should contain it 's origin aspect-ratio
the images should be displayed when their element is visible on the screen.
i 'm not sure if that is somewhat achievable, but it would be nice if there was a scroll, just like in a normal page with input forms.
mobile app should run whitout blank screen or unexpected delays.
i did not upgrade my cli at any point so would expect -v2 flag to generate v2 app.
i would like to continue with v2 for now and would expect the same project structure with the --v2 flag.
the setroot function should work and the promise should resolve.
as long as the user only navigates between tabs (without clicking on an active tab again) the navigation state should be remembered and not be popped back to root.
i should not have to click(tap) twice at the item in order to trigger the click event.
ionic 3 load time on ionic view and device should be be consistent, if not faster, than ionic 2
input shouldn 't lose focus in a toast present.
the [rootparams] shouldn 't be 'undefined ' when a tab is selected again, rather have the same [rootparams] as defined when pressing another tab other than the active one.
pushing an object that looks like this: `{title: "title", $key: "key"}` would create a dynamic link through the segment property of @ionicpage when i have specified the segment property to look like this: `page/:$key`
"activated" class should be added
the app should be returning my json data in each `subscribe` function.
i think it should be possible to add a toolbar globally in the app, calling `content.resize()` on all views ' `content` components and have them resize, even when the views are inactive.
the items should not be re-created especially if the affected item is not in the list of rendered items.
same as the close behavior via keyboardaccessorybar
it should work normally as it works on the regular browser.
which is how it worked before upgrading to ionic 3
map should be rendered in the window.
return a string with formatted number without errors.
i expect it to return to the root view
iphone se simulator will use one of the three generated splash screens.
((hopefuilly the extra text makes you happy)
the new character should be appended to the existing contents of the field.
the spinner shouldn 't be blurred
pressing the active tab again should not reload the view.
would like to see ionic repository include a `security.md` file at the root, similar to discourse phofhyperlink which provides clear guidelines and direction on how to report this type of sensitive information.
i expect `getcontentdimensions` to return the correct values, as `ngafterviewinit` is supposed to run after the view is completely ready.
add value prop on the button object.
version 1.3.3 should be available on github and bower.
this confirm phone call alert on ios devices should not disappear and show up again when letting the alert be present for about 10 seconds.
content should resize with opening keyboard and both footer and header should remain visible so long as is called.
the application should open and load the main page.
i expect the app to launch and go to the root page
the ui should reflect the values bound to each different select independently, not mixing with other select items of the page.
toggle is supposed to trigger a function when it is clicked on.
scaffolding an app should have the latest cordova-ios version, currently v4.3.1.
running the command `cordova platform update ios` within the project folder after scaffolding finishes, the version gets updated to 4.3.1. running simulator via `ionic emulate ios --target="iphone-6s"` shows app without popup like before.
live server should keep running.
this is very bad development experience.
navigation inside modal from tabs should have animation consistencies.
when click on the about tab, the scroll should go to bottom
transition to next component in stack in our app.
this works on android (also browser android emulation)
platform.is("windows") should return true platform.platforms() should return: cordova core windows
i expected that the tab doesn 't cut the content on the first load phofimage
ion-refresher shouldn 't be affected by ion-scroll component.
by calling present (), open (modal, actionsheet, alert)
the slides should be aligned.
the input/form would move smoothly.
manual changes to the url are recognized, as used to when using ionic without ionicpage
behaviour without ionicpage: `<a href="#/about"
error in console and ionic error visible.
screenshot for android (also works with the web) with the same code that did not work well under ios.
image phofimage image from android
this should work like a sharm :smile:
the user should be notified about the new alert on the screen and about the loading indication.
loop=true option should not affect on slideto() method!!
ex) slideto(0) = shows first slide slideto(1) = shows second slide
how can this be debugged further?
i expect the datetime to return an iso string as it did in ionic 2
line separators should show as between each ion-item.
in the previous version the menutoggle directive show the buttons on left or rigth inside ion-navbar and was center with ion-tittle doesnt up.
the ion-list must be refreshed like angular do for a standard list.
navcontroller.push should accept components being part of a structure as first argument as it did before (ionic 2).
text will automatically break between words.
it would be handy in ionic3 to also return the segment name or ionicpage decorator so that it could be compared to the page.component reference.
without the bug angular update the view if i change a value.
click propagation should be stopped when navigating from a page to another.
the menu should be able to be closed immediately after is opened, so there is a fluid navigation instead of a glitch effect or a bad response behavior.
the events should be able to be listened/triggered by the rest of the app code, so we can have control over the user interactions.
when use refresher.the pull down operate should be smoothly.
element should not be clicked when scrolling a list.
the loop should go like 1->2->3->1->etc, or 0->1->2->0 depending on how you count.
a fix for the ion-scroll scrolling or a redo of the method
deeplinker should not set the page if the same page is currently set.
the input should be scrolled into position such that the user can see the input above the keyboard.
correct rendering/behavior of toggle-control in "ios" mode on windows platform.
- assign urls to pages without creating a page module.
- documentation about assigning url to page, what needs to be imported in a module
shoud look like before in 2.3 bildschirmfoto um 22 24 16 phofimage bildschirmfoto um 22 46 47 phofimage
issue 1: url should change issue 2: url should change back to url of a page issue 3: url should not change at all when modal is shown, just like alerts.
when you click into the select or date field it should have all the form control options.
so if you do not select anything the field should show the user with proper color that is required or have required validator (and other validators) accessible so user can be shown it is invalid.
also, if you go to a "prefilled" form select and date field should be highlighted (at least for material design) with proper color.
the thing is, it would be nice if we can call in navguards directly some httpcalls, but this for now we can not do.
i don 't know if this is a bug of promise/observable or ionic.
fix the time violations somehow by implementing things that will increase events speed.
and while i don 't expect extreme support for older devices, i think that a better touch/events handling can always be done.
input schould scroll up and stay above keyboard.
latest ionic should behave like 2.2.0 on uiwebview.
this error does not occur and the platform onready event is fired.
tab shouldn 't reload automatically, should not show black screen obvs, shouldn 't do anything really.
only `ionviewdidload` is called but not `ionviewdidenter` when pushing to a currently
there should be no error thrown when performing cleanup in the destroyloop method.
the application waits for the initialization, then reveals the deep link.
or disabling deep linking while maintaining lazy loading.
it should not allow more than the specified number of characters to be entered in the field.
because this is ux, the swipe must consistently feel smooth
only possible to mark text, never show the marker on top when nothing to mark example for proper use: image phofimage
always render what is viewed, no unrendering when it is in content
work sidemenu scroll fine like ionic 2.3
there is no delay between click, the performance should be comparable to ios / android build or on chrome browser
while popover is shown, a click on the map should close the popover.
the browser should dsplay my-page instead of an error
clicking one of the days/months/years item causing it to be the selected item.
this error does not occur and the platform onready event is fired.
the page url shouldn 't include number sign ` phofurl
cursor should have the same behavior with virtual keyboard as physical keyboard
when i run `ionic` cli commands that update the config.xml, the commands should either always insert the new line at the end or maintain style previously used in file.
i 'd like to set a number of page visible.
every time a scroll to bottom, it will load next data.
and increment a page number.
when the page number reach the max visible, the first is unload.
same job when we go to top, but page number decreased, and biggest unload.
in facts, actually i do this, but my problem is linked to the scrollposition that i should compute for scroll at right place when i unload a part of data.
any other idea manage simply scroll of view is welcom.
not jumping up and down, just scrolling to the selected input.
`func()` should be called on model changes of all child elements.
while this happens in chrome, in safari it does not..
switching between pages with slides should not break the app.
the 'cancel and 'ok ' buttons must appear even in the landscape mode and must be fixed similar to the item label with a capability to scroll only the items in the select list.
on slides, for example, i should be able to scroll on my trackpad (or mouse scroll wheel if it has horizontal scroll) and have it pull the slides over.
on the picker, for example, i should be able to scroll up and down and have the lists respond to that.
on a list with swipe-able items one on desktop should be able to use their trackpad quickly swipe through them.
back button should always work
if i click on a tab, that is already opened, nothing should happen.
both of the examples should refresh the view appropriately.
without the chrome inspector being responsive it isn 't possible to check css changes.
edit and save a scss file takes a huge amount of time when fine tuning a design
to work like a live reload.. i only need to run ionic serve once then any changes i do in the code will automatically show in the browse .
i 'd expect the text to show up.
there should also be events emitted, when the user releases his finger and the content scrolls automatically because of momentum.
ion-img top value should be relative to the scrollable container, not the viewport.
either the old menu should be disabled already when the transition is started or the new menu should re-enable itself after the transition has been completed.
to get the app running in the browser
setting the model should bind the user interface control to the correct value.
when clicking on a menu element, only the associated menu should take place.
when clicking on an element, even on padding, the click effect should take place.
there can not be a situation in which a click animation is shown, but action is not happening.
when input focus, screen will slide up to prevent the keyboard from overlapping input that focus and hold until user touch other space or keyboard hide, screen will slide down to same position.
the subtitle should be styled in a way that works well with each platform.
a module represents a feature area and can contains any number of components and services.
this feature area should live in it 's own folder, and the entire module should be able to be either lazily or eagerly loaded.
any services provided in the lazily loaded module should be module scoped and accessible to all components in the module.
the ion-content should have the correct margin set, based on the height of the closest ion-tabs.
it should work as expected on ios cordova cli: 6.5.0 ionic framework version: 2.3.0 ionic cli version: 2.2.1 ionic app lib version: 2.2.0 ionic app scripts version: 1.1.4 ios-deploy version: not installed ios-sim version: not installed os: linux 4.4 node v6.9.5 xcode version: not installed
the tab button should gain active state immediately.
have the virtuallist display the text without disappearing.
user should be able to move zoomed in slide to look around it.
to be able to navigate properly
icon to be horizontally centered inside the button, as they do in the other browsers.
after running `ionic serve`, the browser should open with the home page of the project.
i expected that i can only choose from the given minutes.
a combination of screen size and using a boolean valu
browser opens and serves the ionic 2 app from localhost:8100
it should work like v2.2.0
the content component should fire scroll events when scrolled.
should scroll to the bottom
no click event delay irrespective or using "click" or "tap" event in the response time for registration of the event
the icons in the navbar should fade out as the new pages icons fade in.
immediately change that badge number
the standard ionic template blank app should display "the world is your oyster"
we should be able to add as many named colors as needed.
also position shouldn 't matter.
the statusbar should be transparent and should be overlapping with the content.
<img width="339" alt="screen shot at 4 03 13 pm" src=" phofurl
start the black and white problem can be solved
any count of slides should work together
the highlight bar should only be under the current tab bar button.
there should be no error and the build should complete.
should make `tabspage` the last item in the navigation stack and thus the app should close when the user hits hardware back button on android if person has no more views within hierarchy of current `tabspage` roots navigation stack.
when removing the `padding: 5px` from the `grid` class: image phofimage as you can see, the difference is not 5px in each direction..
'clear ' attribute should apply the clear style to the button
when data bound to ngmodel is '00:27 ' and picker format is 'h:mm a ', picker should open as '12:27 am '
virtual scroll should work just like in version 2.2.0 when the data is passed via async pipe (observable)
when you click on the field the keyboard opens and the field becomes visible.
create a contact object with no issues.
when using formarray the data interpolated into value should stick and appear in the input box as the initial value.
if the data is interpolated into actual input and not value attribute then it will work for ion-input, but nothing works for ion-textarea
i would see the list being populated and the child component being populated with data.
* loop from first slide to last slide should work.
* loop from last slide to first slide should be at first instead of second slide.
clicking the button on first slide triggers the handler regardless from where i navigate to that slide
the pagination bullet of the last slide should be highlighted.
menu items in splitpane should show phofcode screen shot at 10 41 08 pm phofimage
show the list items correctly king regards
the grid resizing should simple work :p i tested this on different scenarios and i have always the same problem, i don 't know if you can reproduce it?
are you able doing this?
you can do two things, or reproducing something like me in my app, with a classical list and a sub list which works, see the screenshot image phofimage or you can do something which is more similar to the new md contacts web app, something like this image phofimage image phofimage to have a more desktop look and feel, the menus should have an activated color and an hover color which should be the same.
what do you think about this new feature?
this would not be to difficult to implement.
please let us know about your internal feature requests, your plans, your opinions and especially your decisions!
the toggle should not be able to enter this buggy state when clicking just outside the toggle button.
i would like to set the menu width to e.g.
20 px so i could have a list similar to page dividers: a b c etc, is that possible with the current version?
i was hoping alert.present() would return a promise that resolves with the value of the users action on the alert.
for instance on a confirm alert it could resolve to true if they hit ok and false if they hit cancel.
this would enable me to chain an action on the result of that alert.
as i have to have it nested within button options.
on native ios apps, it looks like: (mail, whatsapp) image phofimage when focused: (hiding header, with cancel to right) image phofimage
i would aspect slides rendered correctly (one per page, with swipe between them).
like angular, add a release schedule file: phofurl including v2 and v3 - currently i don 't know when is v3 even planned for, and it 's current state.
it seems out of date, and i (and i think many others) would love to give it a go
native keyboard should display word suggestions if ion-input attribute autocomplete is set to true / on on both ios and android.
video can display in fullscreen when use ion-split-pane component.
`c` displays and behaves (ui updates, change detection functions) as if it were opened via `.push()`.
the changes of the items visual representation should be reflected immediately after the items bound property has changed.
transition * => void should be kicked in when i dismiss the modal.
text are keeps visible and shows cursor.
the overflow background should be the same color as the content, with an option to supress.
or perhaps (better imo) to have: `<ion-content
versions to be app-scripts 1.1.4, ionic-native 3.1.0
the visible lag shouldn 't happen it degrades ux interaction.
application run normally, sqlite works and scanning with zbar work properly.
i expect the lighthouse plugin to pass the test.
the expected behavior is no click press tap etc events from the first page persist when the second page opens.
when tap occurs, if the focus/keyboard is not shown -> show keyboard and focus input.
if the textarea has focus and keyboard is open -> tap on `ion-textarea` should not loose focus and close keyboard, instead should allow user to change the location of cursor and select text in textarea.
show tabs and correct label
need an event to capture slide change is started but not completed.
i only wanted to pick and display full name of a day(from _monday_ to _sunday_).
no flickering, smooth animations like in an ios simulator
i expect ionicerrorhandler to catch all errors that happen in the application, including errors in the lifecycle events.
ion-sliding-item should be able to be opened to any percent possible programmatically.
ion-sliding-item provides one feedback hook that reports back the percentage dragged and one control method that can close the item if open.
as an extra feature i would think it would be desirable to be able to open an ion-sliding-item at will programmatically a given percentage.
this would enable us introduce a user the sliding item functionality across different lists by doing a teaser animation (open, then close up a certain percentage in first visit).
ion-sliding-item has all the functionality in place but control api is kept private.
scrollable div instead of creating a new line when an item reaches the end of the document
it should work like it did 2 days ago.
i used the exact file, exact command.
some format that enables the following input format datetime phofimage
dynamic tabs appear between static tabs, the position they get assigned in the code
you can scroll over all elements no matter how deep they are nested.
*ngif is should work as it expected
without the bug the two lines of example code in the docs phofhyperlink should work as described.
the standard android overlay for pasting content should appear
hours/minutes columns should be displayed and limited to 01:20 am and 01:45 pm.
(simulator print) spinner should be aligned despite the content - preview phofhyperlink
when android talkback is enabled and the user selects an input or ion-input, the keyboard input should be tracked in the selected field.
1. please close the cli bug for creating also the ios pictures.
2. if the pictures from android resource configured as icon in config.xml should be the favicon for browser, it does not work.
if this should be picture for pwa icons, i think created pictures for browser and pwa could and should be same.
3. if i misunderstand anything, this should also be a feature request :) please create also favicon on creating resource
duplicated slides should update on method call if loop is enabled or `destroyloop(s)` and `createloop(s)` method should be public and available on slides instance to fix the loop after update.
expected layout is: image phofimage .
code below produce this layout (using html / css / flexbox).
i expect to see the map working smoothly as it does inside a page component.
the speed needs to improve by order of magnitude to make it usable for my client (and i believe or others).
it should run the provided function when reaching the threshold in firefox.
the slide updated loop state
i 'd expect to add a menu to a tab without having to manage what is enabled or not.
solution: make the border radius property configurable via sass variable.
so in this case i can set the value to 0px without having to override it with !important in my css files ...
input should still have focus.
this works on a simple html page (like google.com).
we are using an integrated barcode scanner, when we launch it the application (and so the input) loses the focus.
outside ionic, the keyboard is closed and scanned barcode is written in input, but in ionic nothing is written, because input has lost focus.
one would expect that the dragging would behave exactly as the open/close button menu does.
it is expected not to have a white screen..
should just executive and get the info while the app is running without minimizing the app phofcode no output - no errors everything works fine it just needs to be minimized for some reason
i expect the screen to not move unless the item i 'm scrolling gets near the top or bottom, at which point the screen should scroll in that direction.
after doing `nav.push`, a new page should open, with a button saying the title of previous page.
should take less than 5 seconds.
the header take the correct height
should not fire the event, and if it does fire getactiveindex() should return the max index, not actual index +1
when run the app i expect see the home page
a no-bounce screen in iphone
can open side menu event the page contains a list with virtual scroll.
open a new window with the toolbar and the close button.
keyboard should not take additional space.
the toggle should be activated and switch states when it 's `ion-label` is clicked/tapped.
phofcode this occurs on version 2.2.0.
the hardware back button should dismiss the controls as it would any other popup.
it worked before ionic 2.1
keep autoplaying even after popping.
android emulator should reload and console logging should appear in terminal.
if i update the scripts section of the package.json to look like this: phofcode then console logs appear and reloading works but is flakey and the app won 't reload properly and hangs with white screen of death.
after close a modal fire ionviewdidenter in previous page
just like android, it should resume like nothing happened and stay on the last view we were on.
when you install ionic locally, use the locally installed cordova (the one in node_modules) if available.
server-side rendering with angular/platform-server (previously angular universal) to optimize initial load time and make a pwa seo-ready.
icons on buttons should be completely visible.
the ionic and/or browser pinch zoom events should be disabled to allow the map events to register, resulting in the map zooming.
this is an identical example without ionic that works as expected: _code_: phofurl _fullscreen demo_: phofurl
a way to have the popover dismiss after pushing a page but not cause the new pages in the nav stack to become root while not actually being set as root.
when clicking return " on keyboard" => keyboard will be hide
the status bar should not overlap.
refresher components should only be fully visible when pulled down completely.
the arrow points to the right correct phofimage
arrows should be visible when the detail-push attribute exists.
ion-slide elements in a looped ion-slides should always respond to click/tap events, no matter its position or how many swipes performed.
the ion-footer should disappear on vill leave or follow the same effect as the page ("slowly disappearing to the right")
when scrolling the content and then tapping a tab icon while the content is still moving, the scrolling should halt and the tab should switch.
there are should be two date items with different params
be able to add width-100 to an <ion-col>
all template changes should be reflected immediately on live reloading.
multiple `ion-slides` per page should work properly without being coupled in any way.
expose `lazyloading` , `lazyloadinginprevnext` and `grabcursor` attributes phofcode
ion-slides should have a output/event-emitter for the `oninit` event of the underlying swiperjs instance.
the `ion-slides` component allows float values for `slidesperview`, this is an important ux/ui element as half cut-off content gives the user a hint that horizontal sliding is the interaction method here.
pre-rc5 this was working as expected
the link should open a public page and not a localhost page
the loading component is dismissed properly.
the page should not break
smooth animation between page transition like it is displayed in the browser or using e.g.
all template changes should be reflected immediately on live reloading.
displays all 55 toasts back to back.
i would expect the popover to render with arrow underneath whatever element i attached it to.
i 'm not sure which should be the right behavior
ionviewcanenter method of a tab to be executed every time user switches to it.
i would like to have access to my class properties and services within my custom header function in order to customise the header functionality.
given an ion-grid component and a series of ion-row and ion-col components.
when an ion-input component resides within an ion-col component, the on-screen keyboard should not cover the input element when it has focus.
the below demo does not use the grid/row/col components.
the error should not appear, and setting up the cordova timeout is not a solution (which btw also didn 't work for me).
what can i do to resolve this and what can i do to speedup the loading of the app?
i think it should be also possible share the header for the two panels, so the left and the right panel has same header, this would respect more md design and it would be as new google contacts web app which is an amazing and beautiful md app.
see this screenshots: image phofimage image phofimage image phofimage
it should be possible to only include platform specific styles.
ios go button does not submit form when form submit button is disabled.
google map are not hiding when i call the showbanner.we need the both google map and admob banner in same page.
it would be great to somehow allow for formatting the text on the pin!
lock vertical scrolling of the view whenever the user is swiping back
all input caracters must be visible all the time
should work with any direction
show all the elements inside the `ion-item`, included the `h2` and `p` elements
working like a clickable div element : without tappable : 300ms delay, and with : no delay.
at least a way to track wich is the code causing the error without referencing polyfill.js
`ion-textarea` shouldn 't go out of the view
loading screen should be able to display without any re-initialization.
ion-slides continues to play (ie.
fire ionslidedidchange event and calling the associated hanlder slidechanged() code until my code logic stops calling
i would expect `ngafterviewchecked` to be triggered only after a relevant change that requires a rerender of the template, not every second.
the current version of angular 2.x produces js bundles with larger size.
whereas angular 4 introduced a new view engine in which they made some changes which reduce the size of the generated code for components by more than half.
changelog: phofurl view engine design docs: phofurl though angular 4 is still in rc, but i believe its the right time to add support for it in ionic 2. since its mostly aligned with angular 2.x so it shouldn 't be an issue to add its support.
the only thing i see is that they have pulled animations into their own package and if ionic uses 2 animations (which i hope), it will require some updates to the animation parts
app should start without crosswalk browser.
text-center css utility center align the text.
deep linking should work when using the path locationstrategy.
i hope i can select any future date without changing my mindate.
when i scroll to horizontal the right end, it will not trigger the loadmore event.
only i want to trigger the loadmore event when i scroll to the end of view .
here is my code: `<ion-content class="has-header" overflow-scroll="false" <div> <ion-scroll auto-scroll-height class="scroll-table" direction="xy" scrollbar-x="false" > <ion-refresher pulling-text="" spinner="ripple" </ion-refresher> <table class="padding " border="1"> <thead class="table-header"> <tr class="headercolor"> <th ng-repeat="item in listheaders track by item.columnindex" </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr ng-repeat="item in listvalues track by $index"> <td class="text-left" ng-repeat="cell in item track by $index">{{cell}}</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <ion-infinite-scroll distance="1%" ng-if="param.hasmore" > </ion-infinite-scroll> </ion-scroll> </div> </ion-content>` is anyone had this question?
is anyone would help me solve this problem?
expect the tab to switch and the new root page to show
it should direct to the ion-img docs page phofhyperlink .
let items in the list be displayed with the correct styles image phofimage
i would expect that the tabs would remain hidden behind the keyboard, and when it slides back down, they would be revealed again, in the same position.
the color of the buttons in a searchbar is configurable.
nav.pop() to fire once according to the condition 's.
i expect `dismissonpagechange` to use viewcontroller 's idea of what it means when a page changes.
since the nomenclature is not `dismissonpagedestroy`, but rather "change".
a page could be hidden from the user, but is still alive, as with the case of navigating between tabs.
i would expect the list to scroll whether it is used in a tab page or not
that you can setup a slides component that can be swiped horizontally and it 's inner slide component content can be slid vertically.
the bullets should not be clickable unless `paginationclickable` is `true`.
the `paginationclickable` option is `false` by default, so they should not be clickable by default.
i would not mind if the default was `paginationclickable = true`, as long as setting it to false worked.
although such behavior is not to be recommended, sometimes it is needed to place the `ion-refresher` inside a component, for example on my case: i have 3 lists which are identical in look and behavior, but with different content every time.
so my list component should have virtual-scrolling, refresher, infinite-scroll etc in that one component.
one should be able to drag open and close the side menu
when i used `var tab_index = in ionviewdidenter() and onslidedidchange(), all going well.i can get index.
but , i write `var tab_index = into ontabschange(){}.i got the runtime error cannot read property 'index ' of null
the change detections works after launching the app from a push notification.
i 'd expect not to see "undefined" multiple times.
ion-tabs should be hidden on all sub-pages.
mode must be applied regardless the default of the system, as what described here: phofurl
the slider should be draggable on touchscreen.
a click event should fire once.
normal full icons inside ion-items/buttons, no cuts
property serviceworker exists and also imported by ionic 2 using sw-toolbox, why i can access it only from the `index.html` as mentioned in the documentation phofhyperlink .
why i can 't access the service worker from inside my app?
i want to be able to select text from the error message and paste that into google to see how i can fix the problem
i would expect the same error response for both cases, so the status code = 404 (not found), to properly handle non existent resource.
both filters should be applied.
this works when running the application in a desktop browser, but not when running the code in the ios emulator.
it should be possible to access the slides instance methods and properties without using the settimeout function.
the pager should jump to the last dot matching the last slide.
browser and mouse back buttons pop the current page.
we expect to see the fields, but all ion- tags (ion-label, ion-input...) would not display.
it works fine if we use ngif instead of ng-switch.
using a query parameter to set `md` mode will only affect the visual style, not set a mobile device mode that assumes touch events.
loadingcontroller should prevent any hardware back button press from working or dismiss the loadingcontroller when the hardware back button press takes user to the previous view.
i don 't mind the youtube app launching, but i 'd like it to wait until at least the user clicks play.
expect to click on search bar and text box remains focused, allowing a user to type something in.
android application should load quickly after splash screen disappears
`ion-tab` elements would not be anchor tags, and thus would not trigger 3d touch.
infinite scroll should be functioning upon entering the view.
the header bar should be below the status bar like on normal pages.
navigating between pages should correctly remove listeners from elements to avoid detached dom nodes
the default button size in ion-item to be normal
changing to `false` in a child view should disable swipe back on the child as expected.
views that use google maps in full screen, or other touch/swipe based gestures on large containers need it disabled for usability.
the components should be created in the angular zone.
otherwise the change detection does not work properly.
to work normally as it does in debug version.
changing the content of the ngmodel, regardless of where, should update the ion-select, as happens when the multiple option is not used.
tell me what is the proper way to get params from url?
push a page from a modal page with and page has normal header.
with the ios statusbar not mixing with the ionic header.
push a page from a modal page with and page has a header with correct padding.
config param widget:packagename should be used in config.xml as done by cordova.
after changing orientation, slides should adjust the inner content position to fit the screen.
selecting a radio option should update the binding variable in form.
logs and html elements should be shown if device is connected to safari on mac
i expect the bound model 's value to become null or undefined.
platform resume() and pause() methods should work in browser too
i should be getting the splash image that 's specified in config.xml
i would have thought we 'd get the `ionviewdidleave` followed by the `ionviewdidenter`
i imagined that if the page is constructed every single time it is called, the html state of it should be empty at that point!
when `iondrag` event fired is should update object and title should change in the html.
the option is not selectable.
tap events are fired only once.
when the new slider page is opened it should be controllable.
`resolve` the `promise` should close the current page and go back to the previous.
the open() could return the overlay object(viewcontroller) which is presenting the alert or the object may be made public in the class rather than just be accessible only in open function locally.
virtualscroll works without runtime error.
when ionviewcanleave() returns false and navctrl.pop() is called internally by the framework when pressing the device back button, a catch() should be made internally on the pop() call to prevent this uncaught promise exception.
i would expect the scroll bars to only show up when necessary.
i used devtools to remove most of the text, curious to see if maybe it was just a bit too much, but it didn 't remove the scrollbars.
`ionviewcanenter` should return the promise output.
it should just say "back"
i expect inputs to be empty after clicking on the clearinput icon.
some error indication about no form control with given name would be nice.
i can even post pull request myself, i guess this is easy fix, just need some hint where the problem might be.
ion label inside ion item should work so we can put chips inside ion item.
slide goes to second element without triggering the events.
im using the same procedure for all tabs, so data should appear nor matter the order.
tab-slide-box should show the selected tab whose index is passed in the tab attribute.
the elements in the customized component should be styled as if the customized component doesn 't exist.
i expect letting go of the refresher would return to state inactive, progress 0
i expected all classes to be compiled and be available for debugging (even if they were not explicitly instantiated in the application)
simply show the version or give a command that works.
for the `ion-content` to be re-rendered beneath the `ion-searchbar` when it is toggled to show after being hidden, and for the `ion-content` to be pushed down to accommodate the expanded `ion-header`.
i expect statusbar and navabr to hide with the keyboard when leaving inputs.
it should accept float numbers not only integers
updating sass variables update the view
it should be working the same way as when compiling jit, even better.
possible ways to of "nice" behavior, in descending preference: * no dependency on ruby, but using phofurl or phofurl * fixing upstream so the error about missing ruby is properly propagated by `failreporter` * hacking the `lint.ts` gulp task to properly show the error * document the need to install ruby/scss-lint gem in readm
when i 'm on the customerdetaildeeppage, i expect to have the defaulthistory add to the navigation array as i mentionned it ot the deeplinkconfig.
furthemore i shouldn 't see tabs due to `tabshideonsubpages` option set in `ion-tab`
the page should refresh with the current activate page.
not rather expected but a proposal: would it be possible to let the users choose when building the app, if they realy need the other stylessheets included?
`ionic build android --prod --cleancss` also i could think about expanding this feature in removing unused components.
so if someone doesn 't use the tabs component, css for tabs wouldn 't be needed at all.
this could be grabbed dynamically (regex) or user could config all components he 's definitely not using?
also a flattenedstylesheet would decrease startup time of an app aswell.
thanks in advance & greetings graphefrui
can change (for example): - ion-slides background color.
(top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, bottom-right) - inactive color.
app should start on all platforms (did before).
since the errors are rather generic / javascript-related, i assume this is a more general issue with the new release?
the first column and the last cloumn don 't close to the edge
new posts would be added to the document without me jumping down and triggering the infinite scrolling again.
instant feedback such as ripple and page transitions.
i 'd prefer to have the page transition first and load after that if that was possible.
i would expect to be navigated to mypage
if text will not be hardcoded will be easy to change language for app.
calling `getactiveindex()` on an `ion-slides` element should always produce a 0-based index, regardless of whether it loops or not.
i think that when using attribute "no-bounce", bounce should be always be disabled.
splash screen should not take long time and ui should not be misplaced on relaunch after exitapp()
according to the material design specs, bottom navigation becomes left navigation on large screen.
to my mind this behavior should be configurable.
get the current component name inside tab: userpage
1.only those items of virtualscroll must be rendered that are in visible range.
2.any items of virtualscroll outside visible range must not be rendered.
[usually first element of array is always rendered]
the shadow is always visible in the sliding process.
the image height should be seen, the width reduced to fit in the available space without loosing aspect ratio.
if all goes well, the "
ideally i could decide in code whether the click should result in checked or disabled state: `<ion-checkbox [checked]="selected" [disabled]="hidden" (click)="select();
ios should function as android does.
ios should not fire both a "click" and a "press" event from a long press.
the app should send a request with some json 'ified data to the parse server, and return some data in the "success" promise so the user gets validated.
it enters via the "error" promise, tho.
each tab to be rendered only when it 's "active"
i would expect the aria-label attribute to propagate to the tab 's button or by default the tab button should use the `[tabtitle]` attribute for default aria label on button.
i should be able to use mobile and wifi connection without any problem.
all the storage should be cleared on uninstalling the app.
should pass the input data to the handler, to perform action.
instead of using css to generate this element, use the proper ionicon instead.
this would enable developers an easier method to swap the item out for an alternative item.
i needed to have a > instead of the down arrow and it took more effort than i was expecting to replace it.
all the children nav stacks along with the pages they contain should be destroyed when their root nav stack is destroyed.
the ion components appear correctly rendered when the ngif is evaluated tru.
ion-datetime should work on ie or gracefully downgrade to a simple text input box for now.
the select dialog, including buttons, should fit in the screen and the options should scroll.
a normal focus of an input.
the swiper need to initialize every time it's called
could be nice to use virtualscroll inside another loop.
after opening the sidemenu able to directly click a link.
like to extend ionic 2 select component to use modal interface.
of course the current behaivour would be that when focusing the scroll stays stable.
similar to the example here: phofurl
to be able to use the hardware keyboard, and type without the `ion-input` losing focus.
the catch of the android back-button should be handled by the framework too, since its default behavior is the same as the ion-navbar back-button.
if we tap the back button area of nav bar quickly on screen 3, 2 and 1. it should unload screen 3 and 2. and load screen 4
ion-icon text-outline should display for both.
the input should remain populated in password fields when changing focus, just like type=text
text fields inside an iframe should behave as they do in a mobile web browser.
the user should be able to drag the cursor and select/delete text and then be able to continue typing in the text field.
clicking on given ion-datetime should open the correct input.
clearing a filtered virtualscroll list should always render all items.
a page or component that extends a parent class should be able to use the parent implementation if the page or component doesn 't explicitly implement the methods.
full transpiling for everything the app relies on
i expect the prod behavior to always happen.
in other words, backslashes don 't get removed.
i 'm a new user so i don 't know what the 'undefined ' should be replaced with.
access plugin methods on import and be able to call the tint method.
when showbackdrop is set to true (default value), backdrop should be visible and behind the modal component.
the text inside a segment header button should be vertically centered on all devices.
no exception, refresher gets destroyed on page leave.
- sliding list should work and show the sliding buttons when trying to slide.
- the ion lines should not be displayed under the buttons - buttons should appeaer from the right side
it should smoothly push the content up.
i was looking at apps on the market place and in their demos the keyboard scrolls smoothly.
not sure what i am doing wrong.
i expect that i can define default button which invoked on hardware keyboard enter press.
pager must be correctly set after the slide becomes visible.
the bouncing should be smooth, just like on lists that do not contain inputs.
-- ion-tabs should not produce a runtime error when user taps on a tab when
expose `nested` slides parameter as an advanced option.
properly alligned, as like in iphone.
this needs to work more like a native app.
the prompt to appear in the center of the screen.
when the software keyboard opens up, the alert needs to slide into correct position near top of screen.
forms and buttons updating their states with angular directives as they 've ever done.
lint shouldn't raise blocking error when accessing file.type and file.size
select and close alert dialog for single ion-select just by click on needed ion-option item.
in this case buttons are hidden.
this may be optional flag to ion-select.
the behavior for multiple ion-select does not change.
without the hidden all is working fine the slider scrolls back to the center and the bullets are visible
tapping the hardware back button while an actionsheet is currently visible would dismiss the actionsheet.
the button should not get an hover effect or the effect should be a different color as the navigation bar.
something finally please please just make thinks reliable and working, its a so simple pattern that i want to add another toolbar on the header.
ionic 2 select should also support modal interface as well.
it should render the columns, or provide a warning that year must be passed to when providing `min` and `max` years for the picker.
this would also require an update to the documentation.
pages should always respond to taps and swipes normally.
should be able to drag the range to every possible value.
phofcode or change the mixin declaration from: phofcode to: phofcode
the progress should be followed with knob
`virtualscroll` should work inside of `ion-menu` component.
alerts appear as from right to left
sliding to the next slide work as slides suppose to work in rtl apps
the virtual keyboard should only be displayed when an input field has focus.

- the video should stop playing when switching to another tab.
- when a video is playing in full screen, user interaction should be possible for the video not elements which are hidden.
this only happen when running in mobile as full screen on desktop doesn 't hide the tabs buttons.
the footer of the pwa version should not be cropped and should be displayed identically to its page/web version.
`<ion-datetime displayformat="dddd" pickerformat="dddd" should show picker days in full name.
animate: false doesn 't make code execute more than once.
when we go back and forth from page1 to page2 to page1 to page2, the messages should be received only once.
the previous instances of page2 should destroyed on navigating backwards.
give all ionic packages the same naming style, so @ionic/framework, @ionic/cloud, etc.
when switching element to full screen mode, ion-tabs will completely disappeared and not worked.
swipe events should be triggered on ion-scroll elements (as it was, was working till rc.4)
ionic run ios --device -livereload ---> should deploy the app on ipad and also reload the app if i makes any changes in the code.
<img width="1205" alt="screen shot at 6 25 13 pm" src=" phofurl
expected to simultaneously be able to run livereload on ios, android and browser, to be able to test on multiple platforms simultaneously.
this worked flawlessly with ionic 1.x
device ready should be fired within 5 secs
the minified css file should update that relative path depending on how nested the css file is.
the ion slider would accept the ability to slide under user control
the positioning of those elements should relate to the $range-ios-bar-height
it should make a transition back to the last page on the navcontroller stack.
'am ' should be shown instead of 'a... '
i should not be able to modify the text inside an ion-input or ion-textarea when disabled.
the text opacity should also be modified.
the application should be created as mentioned in the ionic documentation and should create ionic.config.json as well.
tabbar rendered correctly when viewport width > 800 px.
alert dialogs should be able to be reused (present & dismiss) indefinitely _
the form is not submitted if the form is invalid.
is there any way to speed this up?
i think change detection may help speedup performance angular change detection explained phofhyperlink
when i use the pull to refresh and scroll down the list and then open the menu the content will not be gone.
for the virtualscroll list to behave normally, even when in fullscreen mode
either the lifecycle events should not trigger when selecting the current page in the sidemenu, or the order be such that leave events occur before enter events.
immediate reaction (no remarkable delay) when pressing a button/tab.
this was much more snappy, when ionic 2 was in .beta phase.
correct the padding/spacing in rtl layouts, to work as excepted: image phofimage
the path with param must work for testing and pwa.
menu for rtl app should open up from the right side of the screen
expected behavior would be one of: - the ui updating automatically - the page requiring a refresh for the changes to be seen - the `config.set` is required to run before a page load for it to take effect
i was expecting the app to open quickly and to fire the functions which are in my 'resume ' event listener.
i would expect the footer to stay static and the list items to move up and down, behind the footer looking at the code, looks like my expectation is also intention of developers, so this is a bug.
i would expect ionslidechange to not fire.
the slide didn 't change.
android icon and launch screen would be generated and added to the android platform
ion-items should be generated if a virtual scroll is used in a popover.
- slider options must be visible
the bom character should not appear in the output.
the ion-item should bounce/snap back to the correct position if pulled beyond the limit.
ideally the grid system would be responsive (a la bootstrap) to accommodate various mobile device screen sizes and rotations.
for example, on a phone in portrait orientation, three `<col width-33>` images in a row look great.
when i flip it to landscape, however, it looks disproportioned.
in this example, it would be great to have five columns in the row to take advantage of this orientation (ie `<col width-sm-33 width-md-20>`).
when viewing on a tablet in landscape, maybe i 'd want ten images a row (ie `width-lg-10`).
any chance we can get this functionality built-in ionic 2?
seted in modules automatic when i add new page by the cli
scrolling in the menu should always work if the content is long enough.
it will be great to expose all the available api methods so that user can have more control of the underlying swiper instances.
correctly show the slider and work when [hidden] becomes false.
or provide a programmatic method to refresh the slider to make it work.
the ui lag should not present.
just like with ionic v1, you should be able to use ion-refresher anywhere, as this gives a lot more flexibility with its use.
however maybe i am wrong and there is a good reason you guys have designed it this way?
it should set the path before ionviewdidenter is triggered.
in my use case i need the current url for analytics logging
text shouldn 't cut when there are long button text
slide image to left and right with rtl layout before rc8 release.
it should be working as per the documentation: > phofurl
i would like an option to make a modal full screen, just as it would appear on a smaller screen like an iphone.
i would like to be able to pass in a cssclass into modaloptions.
the content should not scroll.
data binding to template should works.
the popover would be positioned in the center of the window, as in ios.
expect faster behavior for user touches, navigation events, etc.
the build process not getting hung up.
it should always return the most recent tab component in the selection history that meets the relevant criteria (not hidden, not disabled).
it should enable/disable the elements
renders fast with <button ion-button>
when tab is hidden, tab highlight is recalculated and repositioned.
tab higlight width should be the same as tab button width.
it works properly in safari and in chrome when device toolbar (from developer tools) is actived.
it means, that it has something to do with the height of the chrome window.
service worker should work on a device.
list scrolls back to the top
when i update a variable in the called method change detection is triggered without needing to manually wrap it in a zone.
`ionviewcanenter` should trigger every time right before `ionviewwillenter`.
`ionviewcanleave` should trigger every time right before `ionviewwillleave`.
the current implementation would only be consistent if the hooks were called `ionviewcanload` and `ionviewcanunload` instead.
the slides should slide automatically
making the input disabled should not change the validity of the input.
i expect to be able to move the cursor inside ion-textarea and ion-input and easily edit content.
unfortunately the string is not interpreted correctly.
the timezone information is thrown out.
you get a wrong date format depending on your current timezone.
in an utc+1 timezone becomes 13:30 instead of 14:30.
notification icons would be created.
the input clicked get the focus and keyboard.
the events to be fired when navigating with the side menu.
title should not be truncated in this case.
i expect there is a efficient way to load external url inside my ionic2 app, and listen this web page event.
the `ion-footer` component should animate its whole content, even a custom component.
as you can see on the animation, the footer 's content of the first page is not animated but the second is.
the only difference is use of a custom component.
clicking on a card under any circumstances should trigger the click on that card.
using "ionic run android": deviceready fires, does not time out, and app works.
i just want a simple click
like most applications, apps should enable multiple devices.
in other words use should be able to use both of mouse (including touch panel) and touch device (screen of tablet).
when you filter the list it updates and shows the filtered results correctly with the scroll position at the top of filtered list.
it should display the type of connection
event `$ionicview.beforeleave` of the view 's scope should always be triggered whenever the view is being left while other view of the app is visited.
i think first page data should not change.
in here phofhyperlink , i suggest deferring calling `onplatformready()` by a browser tick by using a timeout/promise/etc.
either ignore the tab event if the next input is on another slide, or move to the slide properly.
maybe just show a console error
modals to show the content fully
config.tabhighlight = true; to add hightlight bar in the tab element
it should not need the user to scroll first
google analytics to reject with some information, or resolve with no information
a loading component with "dismissonpagechange: true" should also be closed when a modal is dismissed.
ion-searchbar should be clearly visible independent of ion-toolbar color
npm install -g ionic or npm upgrade -g ionic works
even if the user scroll fast on a real device, the event ionscroll should be emitted multiple times and fast.
the app should do the login, set the rootpage to the homepage and show the header bar.
developers often update application without changing libraries.
having production bundle split in 2 (_for example libraries.js & app.js_) would allow: - speedup deployment as most of the time developers can upload just changed app.js part.
(_for example when deploy to google appengine just changed files are uploaded_).
on 2g connection few extra mb do make a difference.
- minimize traffic & response time for clients for requests after an app updated.
an additional 1 http(s) request should not be a big deal and not a problem at all for those who use http2 (_you should_).
of course a proper lazy loading with multiple modules would be more generic and preferable solution but splitting into 2 bundles can be good interim or "settings free by default" alternative.
expecting the alert to be closed and nothing else to happen.
1 tabs can be hidden by api 2 ion-content can be extended if tabs are manually hidden, ion-tool-bar will not be given a 50px bottom when tabs are hidden.
i suggest the font size be adjusted dynamically depending on the screen size and the text length
all dials should be visible/correct when presented.
automatic reloading of the served app on file changes.
scrolling all the way to the bottom
padding-right should only be increased when ``clearinput`` is set.
scrollto method of the content component should scroll to desired offset value with a duration of 0 ms just as it did before
the list items get displayed as they show on the documentation phone view, and select options show when tapped and the cursor does not blink rapidly.
the underlying input element should be focused, as is the case on firefox.
should close the dropdown options and slide back to the previous page without any error
i should be able to use the `alertcontroller` within a service to create alerts in both prod or dev mode.
item sliding doesn 't works
when caching is off views (both scope & dom elements) are cleaned up when successfully leaving a view.
upon re-entering the view a single controller is instantiated.
adding parameters to start the datetime at a certain date, like today, will enhance usability.
for example, if my date selection range is from 2000 - 2025, but the users most often select a date within a few weeks of today, it would be much easier to start the datetime interface with today 's date instead of
big slides should be scrollable
for the `ion-input` to be disabled, if set in the state object passed in as a parameter to the `formcontrol` constructor.
like the photo album, zoom follow the fingers.
slide specified by `initialslide` should appear when the modal is opened
see this plunker to see how it suppose to work.
phofurl it works when you put the ion-datetime elements in a ion-item element.
it should select the item by tapping on it.
the singleton service had to be present on the page that i open with popover
we hope it will be that, by clicking a tab button, change some states, the states will be updated in the binding views.
`ion-avatar` should align right with the rest of the text in `ion-item`
it is a quite common task to let user select maximum x elements of a list.
would be great if the alertcontroller could support this by setting a "maxselectable".
also requiring at least x selected elements is often needed so also "minselectable" would be great.
if maxselectable is set to 3 and 3 checkboxes have been ticked, the others should be disabled until user unticks one checkbox.
in case of minselectable, if set to > 0, the ok button should be disabled until one element is selected.
i expected to see a map with a marker
the selected element should say test3, not test1 when the page loads.
it should open native sms app with this number
add button with rename and handler of button to perform actions.
for ionic 2 issues - phofurl
some mechanism that we can configure globally could exist to help us map the current app state, including the active ion-titles contents, to the document title.
use the above snippet in your app to observe the behavior.
a fresh and working install of ionic 2 app with tabs template
the list should display 2 items
1. buttons should always become active when slided.
i would expect a single click on the input to fire the (click) event
i would expect a modal, when presented from a popover, to behave normally just like it is when presented from any other page.
the callback should not be called when closing the page.
it should only be called when you reach the real end of the slides.
according to the documentation phofhyperlink , the event is supposed to fire only when the selected value is different from the previous one.
ion-tabs shouldn 't add the same initial page to its internal nav twice.
it would be great to be able to make custom slide components by wrapping `slide`.
i would be willing to sacrifice the automatic updates when a slide is dynamically added or destroyed.
virtualscroll works great with ion-refresh
(swipe) event to be consistently working across all devices.
the user opens a right side menu.
they click a link that opens a modal.
they then click a dismiss button that's on the left side of the modal.
the modal closes, but the menu stays open.
i think there should be an area (below the hamburger menu), where ionic captures all touch events, to avoid the component showed (in this case iframe) catchs it.
thereby, swiping on this area, would show side menu.
open the app when click in notification bar and set configuration options
when i create toast with duration, i expect no error.
given i am on a page that is subscribing on an event when i have a background observer.interval polling and fire an event i expect the page to receive the event and the page to update the view with new information
the table should be properly formatted and all characters to be displayed correctly.
alert box should pop like on ios and android
although clicking a disabled ion-checkbox or ion-toggle obviously should have no effect, i expect to be able to change the checked state programmatically.
like in ion-input: focus is after the text
conditionally setting the direction of the text in ion-item.
it would hide or show elements depending on the orientation.
map should be tappable without error.
in either case, i can build successfully in `xcode` from did the build defaults change between `rc3` and `rc4`?
or "@ionic/app-scripts": "0.0.46" & "@ionic/app-scripts": "0.0.47"?
platform should detect the device type as "tablet" when it 's the case.
when the data updates, the list should be updated and not disappear.
accept an optional language input and try to display all the calendar information in the specified language locale.
if it is not specified default it to current logic.
if both language (optional input) and locale names for months and dayofweek (optional now) provided, ignore language input and proceed with the current logic.
side menu closes with a single tap of the hamburger icon.
this was an issue in previous versions, was fixed and working fine in rc3.
has now come back in rc4.
successfully complete `npm install` by installing all needed dependencies.
reduce delay from when the popover dismissal occurs to when the parent controller receives the event.
could be fantastic to have a general class text-wrap to apply on different ionic items.
the app should upload second time also
tab traversal should be working in a default setup without any special plugin.
i 'd expect it to render correctly, or at the very least, generate an error.
image will show after a while.
the onclick() method should get called after the ion-slides component wraps around and i click on the slide.
rc3 is booting fine without any white screens following splash-page.
no-shadow on ion-header must hide shadow effect
should be able to set phofcode .
after saving any changes in my source code, sourcemaps in source control must be updated according with my changes properly
in previous versions (up to and including rc3) images were resized to fit in ion-thumbnail.
i believe that in rc.2 clear function worked.
the click event should get preventdefault or stoppropagation applied to it, so it doesn 't apply to the list item, or anything under the cursor when the ion-refresher gets cancelled.
seamless scroll as in rc3
correctly check for bootstrapping code in main.ts, even if it is not in the top-level
i would like to call the device.device.uuid property to get the unique identifier for device.
`ionic-build` and `ionic-serve` should build and serve the app (respectively) as expected.
to match this example: phofurl phofcode
if there 's a conditional, it should still work if the condition returns true.
it used to work like this on rc2.
click inside an input box, keyboard opens, write some text, leave the textbox without error.
page should not pushed upwards.
when clicking outside an input, the virtual keyboard should not appear
the content should scroll up, if the input that the user selected lays in the area, that the native keyboard will block on android or ios.
menu related to navbar should slide in from right
the border should not display if `no-lines` is added.
slide menu opening should immediately disable scrolling on page underneath.
when i change the backdrop 's opacity to 0, i hope the content that under the backdrop can 't be scroll.
how to change the backdrop 's opacity?
calling component should be able to access the called component and its method using viewchild.
if the parent tab phofcode , which has two tabs phofcode (root page) and phofcode ionviewdidenter phofcode userhuntpage should run.
if i set the member value in the instance the value of the corresponding element should be set, just as in a normal input element.
if i set value of element it should be reflected in instance, just as in a normal element.
the border should have the same style for all inputs inside the list.
to pop the view and try navigating to the last component defined in its `defaulthistory`.
exceptions from page constructor should be handled and app should stay responsive.
ideally there should be possibility to define error handler and if none show an alert with error details by default.
without the bug described above, the click event should be fired once.
the next input should be focused and visible.
the recorded audio should be in the specified file.
infinitescroll should work the same as in chrome on firefox
`_scroll` should not be undefined or null when used.
plugin should work as per documentation.
using `navcontroller.pop()` should only dismiss the current page (component).
1) the change detector should not be detached when changing to a tab without a [root] or 2) the change detector should be reattached after the modal dismiss.
deviceready` should fire within 2 seconds with these plugins.
switch to the next input without error
not give error when importing at appmodule a second module that has importing ionicmodule.
allow to import ionicmodule at multiples modules (not only the root).
i expect that pressing on tab page on [sub]subtab will not clear the current tab navigation stack.
you should be able to swipe back.
i 'm pretty sure this used to be the case.
scrolling to work correctly for form inputs on slides.
phofurl see android screenshots below.
i will send a repro project to whichever team member requires it.
in native environment, a sliding item in a list should disable the scroll during slide.
by the way, the the `no-bounce` attribute doesn't work.
1. the title bar can be under the status bar.
2. the menu can show all items.
3. let button can use 'menutoggle ' attribute.
`<ion-content>` 's margin would change dynamically with the height of `<ion-footer>`.
the page sould load on all browsers.
the signature should be something like: phofcode
the `ion-select` should always focus the next immediate following input element in the dom.
either remove the auto-focus functionality from `ion-select` or ensure that this happens consistently.
i would expect that plugin inappbrowser, socialsharing or keyboard for example (but all plugin installed behave the same) would behave "normally" as my app did before updating ionic, ionic-cli and plugins
the variable in double curly braces should be displayed properly as implemented in template html.
when running build --prod, the method should return the same value as when running build --dev
the hooks should be triggered when navigating away from and back to ( through navcontroller.pop() ) the page.
if this is intended, how can i trigger these hooks correctly?
if the displayed time in ion-datetime is 12:01 am, the picker should also show 12:01 am
the text color would successfully change
nothing should change about the view if the side menu is opened above it.
right side menu should not appear when closing left menu, technically side menu should complete closing then the update z-index should occur.
the layout shouldn 't be affected from returning from the camera plugin
expecting ionviewwillenter to fire so as to take the decision to reload data.
i would expect for the site to be served and the app to be built.
or to see errors explaining why the build failed.
switching tabs quickly does not cause a digest error
the text to be visible :)
syntax is ok, compilation process should work properly
appear image of svg file on ionic 2 after build for android
same as with default change detection strategy.
arrow and pulling text appear as i pull down, the arrow changes direction when i pulled far enough.
scroll height from top to bottom of the tabbar.
ionic serve command to work on fresh projects
`ion-textarea` to have an `ionchange` event.
the desired behavior is that the tabs are displayed as usual without getting on top of the header.
app start normally without white screen
scrolling the list is scrolling the list :)
i expect it to look like this <img width="491" alt="middle" src=" phofurl i can make it look like that with margin-bottom:8px on the p
setting "id" in the input options should set the `id` attribute for the input being added to the alert
all components compile correctly with `strictnullchecks` set to true.
the `sticky` property in an `ion-item-divider` should behave the same regardless if it lives inside a plain `ion-list` or an `ion-list` with `[virtualscroll]`
it used to return information about the device in it
it 's should have a proper padding and not overlap.
ipa file should be created when running 'ionic build ios --device --release --buildconfig ./build.json '.
running 'cordova build ios --device --release --buildconfig ./build.json ' creates the ipa as desired.
android title class respects $bar-title-font-size instead of hardcoding to 19px
the desired behavior is that the tabs are displayed as usual without getting on top of the header.
the textarea should be updated every time the function changes the model variable.
it should only disable the scroll
when ion-navbar has dark background, change ios status bar color to white to make it visible.
a child component with virtual scroll element should not contain its own <ion-content> container.
menu should open only on pages having menutoggle button in header
when any input field inside ion-slide is clicked , it should only focus the input for typing.
ionic cli adds the latest version of cordova-ios upon adding ios platform by default.
that *ngif works with 2 or more conditions inside `<ion-slide>` element.
navcontroller seems to work with and without mocking or using jasmine.
so by the same means i would assume viewcontroller should work for both scenarios.
when i bind ion-radio (inside ion-list radio-group) to object, i expect that i can select any item (not only the first) and ngmodel value will be changed to the selected radio value binded to object.
when i bind ion-option (inside ion-select) to object, expect that only one ion-option will be selected and ngmodel value will be changed the selected option value binded object.
i think it should slide in front of all other elements.
if we should be replacing the attributes as stated, then this should be reflected in the release notes as i can 't see it mentioned anywhere.
import {hellopage} from "pages/hello"; [...] // works as expected let options = {name: "bill"}; options); // how would i pass the params in setpages?
hellopage]); hellopage], options); // doesn 't work [hellopage, options]]); // what i expected to work but doesn 't ``
i want to trigger the 'refresh ' event of refresher in the function ngoninit() who can give me a demo?thanks.
these functions should only be called once.
it should generate the page and only ask once for login.
the document title shows the same value as in the navbar.
the height and min height should not be applied to the toolbar (only the padding-top)
for the `ion-segment` to continue working, after rejecting the promise returned in ionviewcanleave.
while using a filter with ng-repeat one should be able to reset the filter by using the following code `$scope.filtername = "";` while its working on stand alone angular but its not working when using the same code with ionic
pressing a button on the alert modal shouldn 't make the "tap" event run on elements behind it.
also, an input field gaining focus shouldn 't prevent nav.pop() from actually succeeding.
after using these tags the code snippets should be visible in ionic views but nothing is coming.
the `ion-range` and `ion-select` components should display the values associated with the bound `ngmodel` property.
the color attribute should change the color.
it should change the date
"src" folder exists in v2, but not v1
i want to create dynamic color change for my app example: <ion-navbar [color]="barcolor"> ... </ion-navbar> @component({ templateurl: }) export class aboutpage { barcolor: string; constructor(private nav: navcontroller, platform: platform) { this.barcolor = ?
'primary ' : 'light '; } } any other way to create dynamic color change ?
this is expected behavior but its really bad for me when i cannot get rid of exceptions that been thrown - from my case ionic native googlemaps plugin that is throwing a runtime error and i cannot do anything to catch those runtime errors when i run in browser.... from my point of view thats ok to have this error message because i dont wanna load emulator each time when wanna test some other code that is not dependent on googlemaps.
after going back, again the whole list should be shown.
maybe repositioned to the beginning (like the behavior, when i rotate the device showing list).
ionic serve -p $port --nolivereload should serve my app in the browser
js scrolling helps me showing the form in the right place - however the screen shouldn 't be bumping that way
dom polyfill moved into the polyfills.
a reason why this is necessary so we can download our app bundle and polyfills concurrently without invoke our main, this will result in app booting up slightly faster.
the app should still be responsive.
a popup should appears with all ion-options.
ideally, the angular expressions should be evaluated, so if i write: phofcode the result should be: phofcode
able to scroll top to bottom and see every item in the collection.
it would not throw the error :smile:
it should have the correct tab focus order.
buttons inside an ion-item should handle click events.
modal should show, not be hidden.
buttons may get background color from variables.scss right?.
but this in not happening.
an option should be available to tell the popovercmp if we want to dismiss automatically focus or not.
the parentelement shouldn't be null.
it works in the first place, but second call to the same modal gives this error.
i expected to open a new modal everytime and after that call my getdimensions without getting error.
the modal is dismissed with the hardware back button pressed.
the page should be rendered/persisted as it was before or re-initialize if memory wasn 't sufficient.
every time i click the "hamburger" the menu opens.
i hope this is not expected so and not by design.
the fab button always has to scroll into his ion-content also if it is in a subcomponent.
the behavior i expect is the loading hides when the handleerror is called.
the pagination bullets should show so that it indicates the users that there are more slides and users and slide on.
i 'd expect that when i hit save, the watcher restarts, instead of doing what appears to be a parallel build.
_ion-fab right bottom_ should not scroll.
before updating everything worked as expected (i was working with rc2)
at the end of the build the icon are copied to "/platforms/android/res" (cf : phofurl
including the option to choose either am or pm for other formats than only hours and minutes.
it should be able to update the list after loaded dynamic content
install all dependencies without error.
chrome should refresh the list with two ways binding without switching the browser tabs
any clicks outside of content must be works as expected
a list with virtual scroll should work also without the workaround.
other items shift as you move the selected item.
it should display files in chrome source tab so we can debug our code easily
setting `global.proxy.image` should set the image for both `proxy` and `init`, unless is specified too, which would override it for the init container
until nothing changed in listener configuration `pilot` should send the same listener config to proxies as previously
that the code exampels execute correctly
cassandra nodes should be able to communicate on internodes port.
when i try to netcat to the port 7000 returns immediately.
when istio is disabled the connection stays open until i send characters.
consistent service ports between releases or details in release notes explaining the changes.
or if you're really honouring semver releases, 1.4.0 shouldn't have breaking changes from 1.3.x and a different service port could probably be classed as breaking.
the rbac config to be concise and an explanation in the upgrade notes as to any privilege changes.
status field to be added by the server
creationtimestamp should be added by the server not part of these manifests
when toggling the session_based attribute of my yml file, my infrastructurebackend should be called at the adapter startup or at least produce some errors in the mixer log
no duplicate keys should be generated
reduce istio wastage and improve my service app performance
key value pair would not be present in the generated manifest.
- galley 's probe returns error code and k8s 's liveness/readiness probe should fail.
i understand trace propagation behavior for stackdriver after reading the docs.
if istio-telemetry pod shows running, then 42422/metrics should not be down.
mixer should not panic when adding a new remote cluster.
setting `disablepolicychecks: false` configures the mesh data properly in the istio configmap
the istio operator controller should re-attempt reconcile loop after a few minutes (10?)
when any part of the the previous reconcile loop failed.
the command should run, display its output and return, then the pod should be deleted.
editing an existing gateway 's host list should work as expected.
when a timeout of 0.001s is configured i expect all calls fail by istio with a 504 gateway timeout
the service should expose its metrics to prometheus.
that after applying the istio manifests described in the documentation, that a functioning ingressgateway would be provided.
the sidecar stops as wished.
- i see once "define qqq" message in the logs when the filter first loaded - i see "envoy on request filter" on every authenticated call - i get response 100 directly without call to the service
an out of process adapter listening on check events should be called on each service call.
this expected behavior comes from version <1.4.0.
pod should be deployed with corresponding sidecar.
to set the namespace or to provide a way to change the url
kind exports application and sidecar logs when running test written with new framework.
the dependencies should be of version `1.4.0` so that latest charts are installed.
istio-ingressgateway routes to the correct virtualservices.
tutorial would work and i could have let 's encrypt create certificates for cluster.
after updating the target state of the namespaceselector via kubectl edit, it should keep that state.
response status: `200` grpc-status-code: 0 grpc-message: `{ "message" : "success" }`
all istio pods are up and running.
the front css should work properly as istio 1.3.3
expect the image values to be set with the prefix `istio`.
referring to the previous example, it should have been `istio/pilot:1.4.0` instead.
pilot should send the new pod ip to all the envoys and envoys should have it in cluster member list.
when visit phofurl the jaeger could be used.
- the `source.namespace` attribute should be set to the correct value when the pod name includes a dot.
- mixer generated metrics should include the correct source identify instead of "unknown"
it should be possible to set the email field of the cert manager values.
the email value does exist in the templates for cert manager but seems to be missing in the operator protobuf definitions for values.
`istioctl x analyze` ignores commented out lines.
one would expect that the maximum workload certificate ttl is bounded by the ttl of the intermediate certificate used for issuing.
currently one has to ensure that the citadel commandline argument `--workload-cert-ttl` is lower than intermediate ttl for renewal to work correctly.
i expected that the adjusted
given the following ingress spec: phofcode i expect curling `echo1.example.com` to route to the `echo1` backend.
i expect curling `echo2.example.com` to route to the `echo2` backend.
ipv6 traffic can get out from pods
mixer_codegen.sh to run smoothly when following istio mixer out of process adapter dev guide at phofurl
it should log access log data.
destination workload info should not be unknown
pods should be able to be created from the replicaset without errors
sds always pushing the required crypto to the proxy.
can use the new curl to get istioctl binary
all control plane pods have request size and limits, and liveness and readiness probes.
it should respect and override defined readiness probe configurations.
the go build command should build succesfully
requests be forwarded as normal, under 7ms
grpc traffic shows at http/2.0 on server proxy and grpc traffic not broken
requests should be forwarded successfully, since the rewrite is correct and the requested file exists in the specified path.
arbitrary nr traffic at ingress should not be able to pollute istio generated metrics with junk `destination_service` labels.
either we should set to be "blackhole" or similar or we should exclude `request.host` from the expression for `destination_service` in configuration for ingressgateway (or a third, better option that someone may have).
it should look for the public ip in given resource group which is
if a region fails the cluster needs to be able to heal itself once it comes back up.
it should connect to internal service over `https` just like it works with `http`.
i should be able to uninstall without an error
the secret the user creates remains intact.
the demo secret should not be getting installed when using the `default` profile.
should get a valid api response, similarly to curling the service external ip directly.
the deepcopy of the object is an actual deepcopy without duplication of repeated elements.
if your code uses modules and your go.mod files specifies a language version, be sure it is set to at least 1.13 to get access to these language changes.
you can do this by editing the go.mod file directly, or you can run go mod edit -go=1.13.
instead of adding the trafficassertion, the edge should either be dropped or appropriate default values for "unknown" should be populated.
`istio-tracing` deployment should come up successfully
nonzero exit code and possibly a less optimistic message.
following phofurl sds should be configured to work correctly.
creating a placeholder secret with temporary values, and updating them should result in an update in sds and the ability to access my services.
letsencrypt certs updates are propagated as expected.
all profiles in phofurl should be updated with the release tag.
operator release would use the new istio release image tag `1.4.0-beta.2`
all links to envoy documentation should point to the version bundled with istio, not `latest`
you should be able to view logs in kiali.
possibly not show a file which is no longer documented as an install option?
istioctl shouldn't show the demo-auth profile which was removed from the docs
installs the in ingress gateway as expected
- envoy 's cpu should not be increased so high even if service with multiple ports are deployed.
no errors like this in log
i would expect `go get istio.io/istio` to work
mtls tls handshake succeeds and ingressgateway responds with http status-code "200 ok".
ignore the container with no network connectivity
gateway should listen to all hosts (hosts=*) and present the specified tls certificate, event if it will be a certificate error for the clients, and not loop as a handshake error and consuming all cpu resources.
the sidecar should start up healthy and allow the application 's networking routing to be functional and also bootstrap successfully.
kiali wizards should create the virtualservices, destinationrules and any other required objects to properly apply que requested config in the wizards.
the gw memory usage should increase when a new connexion is made then stay stable
all requests would return with http code 429, none would return with http code 200.
when setting "0"` annotation, i can still call `curl -x post
istio is installed without the nodeagent
running mesh manifest generate with a patch that creates a new map entry should work.
expecting to connect without issue.
need a way to add the ca to the current list of ca certs within the istio-proxy
no errors appear in the citadel logs.
dns certificate provisioning can be turned off
when the grpc server is stopped i expect the channel to go instantly in a !ready state.
sds finds secret and ingress gateway works
i expect non-tls communications to be effectively rejected when the istio cni is enabled.
there should be an envoy endpoint for the service with a subset.
client call should retry when `unavailable`.
remove `grpc.setheader` in server side, the retry policy `works`!
a reverse proxy should be able to reach istio.
resources created by the operator for the control plane and their children resources are all cleaned up when the control plane/cr is removed.
external service should be able to call from istio enabled pod when `serviceentry` and `destinationrules` are created.
expect ingress gateway pod stops forwarding traffic and only resumes forwarding after pod is ready again.
update of serviceentry (including resolution) should either work correctly or a validation should prevent from updating the resolution if it is not easy to support.
mesh proxy state should be consistent.
phofcode we'd better remove redundant quotation signs.
either no egress nor ingress spans should be created, or both types of spans should be created.
phofcode phofcode both serviceroles above should not make service mesh return 403 errors.
or i expect that the documentation for this end updated.
i am fine with only supporting exact service name match.
sds should reload the updated secrets/ssl certs
all pods are running and ready
grafana should show the traffic in out of the box workload dashboard.
the sidecar should startup normally and continue to run, without running out of file handles.
it should check readiness probe and route traffic if it 's ready.
also, it should point to the application 's `/healthz` path for readiness check as described in deployment settings.
return the same certificate for each host
since phofurl doesn 't mention any peculiarities and i was under the assumption that citadel would generate these tokens automatically, it is a bug that istio-token is not generated.
here is one of the many configs that reference the token: phofcode in this case from deployment istio-ingressgateway 's spec for istio-proxy.
kiali would display service details and no error messages.
is to deploy some objects, but what i get instead is this error: `error: release istio failed: deployment.apps "istio-galley" is invalid: required value: must be specified when `operator` is 'in ' or 'notin '` i tried purging istio with helm del --purge istio and re-deploy, but the error always the same but "istio-galley" changes.
i collected 4 different errors showing "istio-pilot", "galley", "kiali" and "grafana".
it should download specific version of istio.
`istioctl x analyze -k` should display some useful output.
grafana shows data from the dashboards
istio helm charts should produce useable charts with the latest stable helm version (2.15.0)
being able to set `use_remote_address` to `false` on the ingress gateway.
i hope i can found the all data through prometheus,tks.
phofurl those images should be named - not some other derived form of these platforms.
this is consistent with nearly every other project release process in the cloud native landscape.
the `k8s:affinity:` settings to be applied to the pod.
the mapping should be for the deployments/pods to get the correct affinity settings.
proxies to remain connected and only receive config when required.
in flight requests should just be drained, and not result in a 503uc.
these xds pushes, if they 're normal, to not reset listeners.
the secret should be reloaded when changed by cert-manager.
connection and upgrade headers are passed through intact to the the backend application.
not to see 503 's on these long running requests.
the stackdriver adapter should be performant under load.
the current implementation calls flush on every inbound `report` rpc phofhyperlink that contains traces deemed to be "exportable" (i.e.
the flush is a blocking operation, waiting on one or more `cond`s phofhyperlink until all in flight writes to the backend have completed.
using `pprof`, i was able to observe the delays: phofcode in one of our non-production environments, the blocking of the stackdriver appender results in handler latency of up to 5 seconds, given a modest load of ~7 dispatches per second.
this is most likely due blocking operation resulting in serialized calls stackdriver backend (i.e.
an inbound `report` call must wait for any in flight calls complete), which turn serializes `report` rpcs.
increased latency results rate limiting other `report` calls, even if they do not contain trace data payload.
instead _manually_ calling flush for each rpc, adapter should defer flushing opencensus library, which takes care this behind scenes, effectively removing following code from phofcode
normal http to https redirection
request can be displayed in jaeger trace
sidecar should follow the mechanism of sending check request even under high load.
kiali should show the traffic for bookinfo app.
the services should return status 200 with appropriate/expected response message.
access nifi on the http port (8080)
the inbound listener is not removed and the pod is able to accept inbound traffic until the main container stops.
connection to to the citadel pod through the gateway should work without handshake error
operation works with the previous version (1.3.2)
`istioctl version --remote` gives the client information
istio installed with post-install jobs via the control plane profile
the `istiocontrolplane` crd is namespace scoped.
if a `namespace: istio-operator` is set on the crd, deployment fails.
examples are modified like below.
- when switching the endpoint of services without selectors, mtls should also work fine.
see each trace only once.
i expect an istio aware pods should have a similar performance compared to their non-istio aware pods.
pass valid chunked message to downstream
when istio scale up or down it 's integration should keep working - policy - pilot - telemetry
mixer should load balance its requests evenly across zipkin instances.
i should be able to generate code for the adapter from the tutorial.
the `x-b3-sampled` header should be set to `1` when a trace is sampled.
the pod application can get x-forwarded-for
should work without any panics.
ingressgateway is responsive all the time
access to sub paths should be restricted
the envoyfilter configuration should be passed down to the envoy sidecar.
all requests to the ingressgateway should return a valid certificate information.
remote connections over nodeport will be accepted, just as always
pilot should not complain about this as duplicate cluster
both containers should be in "ready" status
i should be able to apply drs and follow the bookinfo examples.
if a grpc server is stopped, and it is outside of the cluster, a client application running inside the cluster should still be able to reconnect even if an istio sidecar is present.
it should print all incoming traffic to the application
the source attributes should show information about the nodejs application accessing the db.
for example: sourcenamespace should be `ns-restriction-demo-1` and sourcename should be `node-demo-1`
`a.mydomain.com` should be able to contact `auth.mydomain.com` even if `auth.mydomain.com` runs on a different node than the ingress-controller.
http requests cancelled by client, should be reported with 4xx status code, to distinguish them from "real" server failures.
`istioctl` should show `ok` instead
i would expect them all to be ` phofurl as that 's the short formed url they all use.
the installation shopuld be successful.
i would expect the pod to eventually get the certificate and start working.
no 504s when the upstream isn 't timing out
to have no issues with egress and have 0 conflicts with 443 listener.
and this is what i 'm observing despite of this error above but would like to understand why this is being thrown.
it should point to appropriate domains.
but, when i try to access `api.example.com` i am getting `404-not found` when i delete `example.com` gateway then i can access `api.example.com` service.
it looks like when `example.com` gateway is there it also tries to send api requests thru this gateway which is incorrect.
pods are expected to come up and sidecars should establish connection with pilot.
website should be up with https.
behaviour that matches the documentation.
we shouldn 't get conflicts or listeners being configured for ports that we don 't want istio to care about.
cmd: curl httpbin.weather:8000/ip -s -o '/dev/null ' -w '%{http_code} ' out: 404
when mtls is enabled on both the application, it should be able to connect easily.
upon istio-init, it should install certmanager crds.
routing of the endpoints to the correct services and 404 on end points that do not match the list
i would expect cross cluster calls to be routed the same way for cluster-internal and cluster-external calls instead of cutting straight to the actual service.
whether its sidecar is injected or not, when a call is coming from whitelisted namespace, it shouldn't block it.
either a validating admission controller rejects virtualservices using regexes longer than 1024 bytes or pilot does not panic when asked to generate the route.
creating a placeholder secret with temporary values, and updating them should result in an update in sds and the ability to access my services.
tls service out of the istio service mesh can be used by tcp inner istio service mesh.
i expect the hello application to work and not return 404 when i follow this guide.
all the pods in namespace istio-system should be up and running, and service account and token needs to be created automatically
https traffic for service redirected by nginx also works
locality lookups should fail faster than 10s
a version of certmanager which will not be disabled soon is installed.
as described here phofurl when i set use_remote_address=true and xff_num_trusted_hops=0 using the new envoyfilter api i should see the xff header rewritten by envoy but the gateway ip does not get added to xff and i cannot add the header x-envoy-force-trace to next request.
sum of backends for destination rule should be based on max connections, but we see the limit per backend at 16 (cx_active) connectiondump-cx.zip phofhyperlink
when i configure a virtualservice to mirror the traffic to another service, the traffic should be replicated to that service.
helm delete should have cleaned-up the crds as well.
when applied, we should get a `401`, but an error `503` is returned in `v1.3.0` no matter whether we use `mtls` or not.
tested in `v1.2.6` with `mtls=true` and `mtls=false` works perfectly.
the destination_service_name label for tcp metrics should be set to "blackholecluster" or "passthroughcluster" in these cases.
if i hit say `curl phofurl in our java app we should get the request info as ` phofurl
https request for container can also be tracked.
uri should be rewritten as expected.
`destination_service` label is set to the attribute
when 2 `serviceentry` instances are created for a single `host` having the `locality` set, traffic should be routed by considering the egress locality (just like how it respects locality when routing directly from a sidecar).
the rating service returns status `429` after rate limit evoked.
ip whitelist works for a specific ip
pilot continues serving discovery requests from existing sidecars
all the pods in running state
request should be routed to proper pod according to header presence/value
should be able to configure the tcp traffic from sidecar <-> egressgateway <-> redis
is writable and grafana pod starts successfully.
according to phofurl the default values for `ingressclass` is `istio` and the `istiocontrollermode` is `strict`.
therefore, i shouldn 't have had to update the mesh config in the `istio` configmap in order to use kubernetes ingress resources - especially since these values cannot be set in helm chart today.
retries should be executed for idempotent method calls (get) and timeout in about 5-6 seconds for the test call.
as per the configured virtual service, calls to non-idempotent methods should not be retried could this be related to phofurl ?
connections should not close unexpectedly
mixer to send metric, logs and tracespan to stackdriver.
no 503 when scaling up istio ingressgateway
new installs of istio use the most recent image as indicated by global.hub and global.tag
there should be istio endpoints for the kubernetes service with endpoints
adding ports by name as protocol prefix succeeds.
the http2 traffic for the upstream via proxy sidecar should 't be downgrade/upgrade to http unless the destination end point has a service port defined with name http*.
generated destination rule for mtls respects custom cluster domain
priorityclass should be set in mixer
im trying to expose several web apps via istios path-based routing.
map prefix to the destination and be able to rewrite or redirect.
consistent behavior on a given profile regardless how i installed it.
1. if no container ports defined, istio sidecar proxy should reject/deny all connections, so that consumers sees connection refused.
`istioctl` can have a utility command to accurate display all the target names, and ports that are effectively proxied by istio, and the expected connection type/protocol (mtls, or plain, http, or grpc, etc)
istio-envoy should close connections to non-existent ip addresses even if dns records stay the same.
this behavior, if by design, should be documented.
the documented example phofurl omits these problematic fields, perhaps knowingly.
the correct behavior imho is for the fluentd adapter to re-code fields in non-native formats to strings, so as to generate valid json or msgpack messages.
minhealthpercent in can take effect.
outlier detection will be enabled as long as the associated load balancing pool has at least minhealthpercent hosts in healthy mode.
when the percentage of healthy hosts in the load balancing pool drops below this threshold, outlier detection will be disabled and the proxy will load balance across all hosts in pool (healthy and unhealthy).
see correlated trace spans for each request
i have a regular service mock and a canary service.
i have a simple routing rule.
for both regular production and canary the traffic comes to my container using ingress gateway.
so i would like to match /mock to my service.
only when header has istestuser i would like the traffic to go the canary.
my virtual service looks like this phofcode
session persistence should be maintained instead of expring quick, and service should route to the same pod as long the cookie is alive.
i would expect to be able to see the gateway resource as well.
for all outbound without egress gateway and allow all policy it should not timeout.
services from a remote cluster should be accessible.
either: 1. the virtualservice would work correctly for local cluster traffic where the non-existent gateway is not needed for routing.
2. the virtualservice should be rejected as invalid when applied to the cluster until the gateway is removed or created
to not see any affect on my traffic when doing control plane upgrade of istio
`kubectl exec -it security-master-0 --sh -c "curl phofurl should return valid json from elasticsearch
validating webhook configuration should not have a namespace scoped owner galley validating webhook configuration, replica set and pods should not get garbage collected
traffic should be routed to google and cnn.
go test should works fine
it seems to me that it should reflect the configuration values in specifically indeed, when i edit the hardcoded path to ingressgateway-certs, the ingress example here ( phofurl starts to work.
should not cause https redirect loop
users shouldn't have to install a specific profile to get valid default configuration values
through route53 url -> aws alb -> prometheus service should load in browser phofurl
external authentication should work over grpc when the authentication service runs inside the *service mesh*
boolean values should be quoted correctly
result should be the same.
the label `destination_service` should be set to `blackholecluster`.
install istio 1.12 on d32 vm type
the source field gets reported even on port 8080.
pilot should deduplicate the wildcard hosts in this case, as no real conflict exists.
custom ingress gateway to be working properly
"dns" resolution based entry should work for any https/tls endpoint with the location: mesh_external
communication from outside using ingress gateway node port
connections from pods with an injected sidecar to a postgresql database running inside a different pod with an injected sidecar work fine with activated mtls.
i would expect node agents to successfully authenticate proxies.
service mesh responsible irrelevant to time not using particular container.
i would expect the normal behavior as per the documentation.
certificates should be issued from vault ca and provisioned to envoy sidecars.
manual injection of sidecar proxy should work.
the specified image tag version (in this case, 1.13.1) should really be pulled, not the default tag 1.12.0 instead (which coincidentally points to a non-existent tag version of the image).
istio correctly initiates the tls connection to the service.
the external service is reachable from the client.
https connections should keep working as normal, i
changing istio.configmap should invoke new pilot 's deployment
as claimed by the istio documentation, access to external services e.g.
www.google.com should be allowed by default.
this is happening even despite having by checking `kubectl get configmap istio -n istio-system -o yaml | grep -o "mode: allow_any"` additionally, the call to external service from `sleep` pod was not routed through the proxy.
this was confirmed by checking the request header.
the request header did not have
so as we haven't prevented from setting `istio-system` as root config namespace, we can workaround by removing duplicate envoyfilters.
this should add * one * lua http filter to the matching listeners * before * the "mixer" http filter, not after .
a port named as `http` must work as http on an incoming istio sidecar.
any other optional, ignoreable http/2 headers should not break a `http` port and return a`403` on a cluster with no restrictions or policies (allow_any traffic mode, mtls permissive, no policies or rules, no other istio resources).
small tcp packages can be forwarded to upper layer container.
the route set the right port number
the validatingwebhook can work normally.
pilot should get public key from s3, for jwt verify.
if fail once, should retry.
istio-proxy should have a way to get the key out of cluster.
the call to an external url should work irrespective of the ports used on the cluster and how they are named (especially when they follow istio naming convention)
retries to work and 15 get requests to be sent to the unavailable service.
the same simple configuration to enable jaeger native tracing in the istio-proxy sidecar, which works in versions 1.1.6 through 1.2.3, should * not * cause envoy to segfault, and requests should be handled correctly.
istio-pilot successfully networks with istio-galley, allowing for all other pods to deploy correctly.
sidecars should start up and be configured in less than 30 seconds (worst case) and more ideally in a handful of seconds.
sidecar istio-proxy startup should not be bottlenecking our deployment 's rolling update process as it is currently doing.
our containers are ready in a matter of seconds as should their sidecar containers be.
urls such as /a/b/my%20spaced%20path should give a 200 with the sidecarinjection enabled.
traffic will not be impacted during renew the certificate.
istio ingress gw service definition should not affect outbound traffic at all.
header-based routing rules allow "_" (underline) in the header-name or kali is showing a validation error/warning.
istio-proxy to use a deterministic amount of memory
cors preflight requests should work when a jwt policy is configured on the istio-ingressgateway target.
running helm upgrade should also update the meshpolicy and correct destinationrules when mtls is set from false to true and vice versa.
istio-pilot to not crash and some kind of user input validation
request rates under the defined limit should never encounter a 429. rates above the limit should be restricted to roughly the defined limit.
conditional returning an empty string `""` be handled as empty by the `|` and moving on to the next block.
the services who listen to 8080 can request normally
not to error, to be deterministic in its behavior, to use a consistent amount of memory.
adding the annotation and bouncing pods should make http-based liveness and readiness probes work.
the https connectivity should work
port 443 should be listened on in both gateways.
ingressgateway shouldn't return 503s and 404s
i expect it works with (method post).
however, it returns error 500, bus-proxy 's pod also prints log (i think that the request came to bus-proxy successfully, but can 't go through to bus-id).
istio sidecar should allow the connection since rbac rule is passed
based on the previews discussion here phofhyperlink , the fluentd client should use the async way for creation, so the when fluentd service does not fully start up yet when "fluentd" handle is created, it should get retry or re-connect later.
but it seems not right now.
i expect to have traffic leaving my vm to be earmarked as `example` gateway traffic.
the example phofurl should work.
manifest diff command should not output any difference between helm generated manifests vs operator cli generated manifests.
succeed scraping all pods automatically, both securely (tls) and insecurely.
edited _istio-sidecar-injector_ config map should not revert changes to the `policy` property.
ingressgateway receives service entry update and blocks the traffic.
the same test case was executed successfully on istio-1.0.2 several months ago.
ingressgateway hpa should figure out cpu utilization and scale accordingly.
even without providing an override, the dimensions defined in the instance (quota template) should generate unique keys.
no connection failures occurring on regular operation.
annotations to be documented as they are useful in providing per-workload overrides.
istioctl binary in my path
the `istio-init` chart would have a global value to insert imagepullsecret names like the `istio` chart.
no performance regression from build to build.
pods that connect to rabbitmq with istio running have no connectivity issues
i have followed the documentation for enabling the istio cni.
galley and cni pods are in running state with no error.
if cidrs > 50 entries it should create another sg with limit of 5 sg per load balancer
the horizontal autoscaler uses a metric, which reflects the actual load of a pilot.
cpu and/or memory usages are not suitable.
istio enabled application should be able to call external apis published on given ip address and retry/timeout should be configured by creating istio 's virtualservice
readiness probs will work as intended
jobs must be unregistered automatically
as i understand it, when using a secure ingress with sds enabled globally, traffic through the secure ingress gateway should be terminated w/ the help of the ingressgateway-embedded node agent, and then use `mtls` inside the cluster to communicate with other internal services (with certs from _actual_ node agent running on node rather than one in container with secure gateway).
more concretely, in these examples, request to `httpbin` service through ingressgateway should succeed.
after the pod of service y starts, service x should automatically reconnect to new pod and should be able to call grpc methods without errors.
the completed build process should in the generation of 3 sha256 files- one for each of the published istioctl archives (linux, osx, and windows).
only the subset 's cookie should be set instead of multiple cookies.
no request should fail during an update.
the draining of the pilot agent should take care.
note: using a simple `prestop` lifecycle like suggested in phofurl mitigates the problem.
specify ingressgateway scheduling on nodes labeled ingressgateway = true
there shouldn 't be any (sporadic, automatically appearing/disappearing) connection issues with istio-proxy to external services.
the expected behavior is shown in a separate aks cluster with same version of istio deployed, and no connection issues for external services arise in it.
start productpage with different security context user (non-root) such as 1001 and it starts up correctly.
the dns resolution/eds should be consistent between istio-ingressgateway and other sidecar proxies and should resolve to the cluster local services.
when experienceing steps are performed according to phofurl but this does not resolve the issue as the restarting of pod does not produce matching md5 sums
after migrating to istio the applications should work as before, there shouldn 't be any connection drops between applications and database.
the proxy sidecar won 't be killed, and the stream on the client side will be blocked.
the traffic in case of a pod-to-pod request must be influenced by virtual service and sent 100% to v2 version of application i.e.
nginx home page in my case phofhyperlink
it is expected to install istio with helm.
single-plane, multi-network installation should continue to function if the remotes are removed from the `configmap` resource.
if use specify a profile with invalid ip address, the cli will return corresponding errors to indicate the issue.
after correcting a configuration issue for a remote cluster, mixer should self-correct rather than continue to fail using the existing configuration.
envoy listener configuration changes should be backwards compatible, at least within the bounds of what semantic versioning would dictate.
should not be using deprecated crds
pilot should be able to recognize pods with `hostnetwork: true` as separate and not constantly battle over the same cache key.
ip is not really unique enough to use as the key.
according to the documentation phofhyperlink , egress should be omit-able with following effect: `if omitted, istio will automatically configure the sidecar to be able to reach every service in the mesh that is visible to this namespace.`
prometheus handler will be create
100% of policy checks succeed during a rolling update of adapter pods.
sentinel get-master-addr-by-name should return with master instead of error.
this works well without isito side cars
all ci jobs run in prow
y should reject when request coming from x when user is "abc" not "*".
can not access external url without serviceentry
injection always honors the annotation, regardless of whether the namesapce is marked for injection or not.
changes to the `global.proxy` section of the helm values file (e.g.
should trigger sidecars that have already been injected to be updated to follow the new configuration.
the scheme should be preserved on proxied outbound requests.
i would expect that the test case runs successfully and creates if required a specific `destinationrule`.
expect the keyword "mesh" not to require a namespace prefix
istio-system is active after helm delete and purge
for the same named instance, `memquota` and `redisquota` should rate-limit similarly given they are configured similarly (`maxamount` and `validduration`).
the trace information should be sent to stackdriver.
ability to see the different values associated with egress gateway in grafana.
(same as for other pods using istio sidecars).
the configured filter get inserted into the matching "virtual" listeners filterchain and shows up in the dynamic_listener_config block.
x-forwarded-for headers containing the source ip of the client that made the request.
iptable rules should show as in the logs of the istio init pod.
consul registry should cache the services to avoid too many remote calls to consul server
running `git clone phofurl should bring down the `operator` repo, but does not.
the repo should also mention how dependencies are managed in istio/operator, since the included build steps will fail as listed.
a version of istio-cni helm chart is updated for every release of istio-cni.
it should either use envoy auto mode by default or provide a plilot-agent command line argument to change the mode (considering auto mode 's side effect for ipv4 users) additionally, please consider attaching a cluster state archive phofhyperlink by attaching the dump file to this issue.
on a full cluster restart, the istio control-plane should be able to successfully recover itself back to functionality.
i have single gateway and two virtual services.
two services are sending to ingress-gateway but with different hostname but traffic is routed to same service for both.
errors not present in galley logs.
label selectors in private destination rules should apply for traffic policies as well as for endpoints.
since there is no such limitation on domain name, istio should be able to create them.
no dropped connections when adding new pods with their virtual service.
ignored service tag should be printed as debug level in the log.
it is in contravention to the documentation as below: phofurl note for kubernetes users: when short names are used (e.g.
reviews instead of istio will interpret the short name based on the namespace of the rule, not service.
a rule in efault namespace containing a host reviews will be interpreted as irrespective of actual namespace associated with reviews service.
to avoid potential misconfigurations, it is recommended to always use fully qualified domain names over short names.
service discovery integration between istio and consul using mcp endpoints.
if there is any ipv6 addresses configured on the node, we shouldn 't drop all ipv6 inbound traffic.
requests to *.mycompany.io should be routed via the gateway specified in the meshnetworks settings when the resolved ip matches the given cidr block.
network connections to external services are fast and stable, without periodic hanging.
i brought up a fresh eks cluster without istio, and the issue does not occur.
description should say default is 2, which i believe it is.
we should be able to specify the gateway port using http2 as the protocol.
how this gets implemented should be transparent to the developer/deployer of the service.
documentation should clearly indicate which protocol to designate for grpc traffic, and which protocol is in use for that designation.
if only http or https should be specified then it be clarified if in fact envoy is converting this traffic to http2.
using http2 as protocol for gateway port results in error in grpc connection request not reaching service or even envoy proxy of service.
deployment manager template should be able to install the version that has been released to with all it's components including the crd's
no 401 unauthorized on endpoint `/credit/category`.
services added to the mesh can be accessed by other services.
with split-horizon eds i would expect to be able to resolve any service in the mesh from any pod with a mounted `istio-proxy` sidecar.
given that this installation type leverages a single control plane (i.e.
each node in the mesh shares the same pilot instance) i would expect that every proxy sidecar maintained the same endpoint configuration.
i have confirmed that this is case by using `istioctl proxy-config endpoints` utility on pods in one of remote clusters.
next, i would expect that pods in mesh would leverage these distributed endpoint configurations to resolve services remote clusters by via fqdn or short-name (i.e.
neither of these names are resolvable from any node mesh.
however, gateway control plane cluster _does_ appear to be able correctly forward traffic services remote.
junit.xml contains actual test case information, build-log is manageable, k8s logs are stored separately.
workload is only able to access the services defined in the `egress.host` list of sidecar resource.
injected pods should either validate against a psp or fail with a meaningful error message.
docs have commands that output to a usable `iop` binary.
aborted test should be treated as failed test
that http traffic for kiali + grafana will be redirected to https and that https is accessible over the ingress.
being able to specify - ipv6 subnets for addresses - ipv6 addresses for endpoints in a serviceentry yaml file.
the application gets the source ip of the visitor
ingress gateway responds consistently and does not get _hung up_ in certain scenarios.
followed the instructions in the section _enforcing namespace-level access control_ phofurl and expect to be able to access the any of the bookinfo services going thru ingressgateway or from service to service.
if there is metadata being collected, it should be accurate.
we probably also should not have two different ways of reporting the same information.
either the list of 'hosts ' should match against just the host portion of the header, or the user be allowed to specify host entries with ports included.
serviceentry telemetry is being reported e.g.
not sure if i have all the configuration right but i 've tried lots of different options and have not been able to get it working
1. the code reflects the yaml configuration set by user, not silently overriding it.
2. validation for the case where a single weight destination is either 0 or just <100 is added, so users know their setup is incorrect (which is the reason why it overriden in first place)
letsencrypt certificate should be normally issued/renewed even in case global mtls is enabled.
apply service entry to external service (say, phofurl then apply a fault injection virtual service.
after that is done, when curling from inside a sidecar-injected pod, expect to see the specified fault, say a 500 response.
expect release tarballs to contain not contain yaml with empty values.
istio should set grpc-json transcoder envoy filter configuration when injecting the istio istio-proxy on each new pod.
when checking out istio-proxy configuration, it only appears the default envoy.router http filter but not grpc-json trancoder envoy http filter.
citadel should retrieve an object 's namespace and inspect its labels to determine whether or not a namespace should be "istio-managed".
ideally, pilot needs to check global.sds.udspath before generating sds config, or clear sdsudspath in meshconfig.
so that pilot does not generate sds config if global.sds.enabled is false.
mixer shouldn 't crash on initial start up failing to get to galley, it should just perhaps be "unready" until it 's made its initial connection and got what it needs in order to start servicing requests.
user should be able to access the bookinfo productpage again after the deletion of ip-based whitelists or blacklists
i don 't know how much of an issue this is, but i am guessing it probably shouldn 't be disconnecting.
200 on valid access token
it should return `http/1.1 200 ok` instead of `http/1.1 502 bad gateway`
bookinfo exposed through ingress gateway works
pilot-agent should still start, like it did in `1.1.9`
i would expect not to see any data for perhaps data to or no data at all (because en.wikipedia.org is not a serviceentry)
pilot never polls the kubernetes api to load the configmap but only reads the meshconfig from a file.
the expected behavior is that bogus "match" entries should trigger a webhook validation failure, like bogus entries elsewhere in the yaml do.
when `*` is included in `alloworigin`, send a `vary` header with a value that includes `origin`.
http requests should get routed to the api service if they match the regex pattern.
sidecar injector mutates the incoming pod creation request and mutated pods are deployed.
a working ci and at least some basic validation like `make test` should work.
all assets of the same release should contain identical helm charts.
virtualservice defination to setup tls timeouts.
with and as the only overrides set, we 'd imagine there would be no conflicts to report
data is expected in `istio_requests_total` when using a serviceentry with protocol = https, instead i only see data in this seems true for protocol=http
a request to a service with should timeout after the desired amount of time, especially when a virtualservice is not setting a value itself.
rejected envoy config should be at-least warning level.
all the logs output by pilot which need some fix has to be warn or error level.
limits should be less than requests
we would like to stop the retry.
we will configure retry if we need it.
right now from documentation it is not clear how to switch off the retry.
should receive a 200 when accessed from the internet.
curl --header "authorization: bearer $token" -i -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} "`
if the resulting helm charts should not contain policy service/deployments etc.
has listener on port 80
idle tcp connexions should timeout
istio version is consistently marked as a version higher than previously released.
why the cpu limit is set so big, 2000m?
can we modify it smaller?if yes, what 's the rules to follow to deduce the size?
setting the value to `"password"` should result in kiali expecting the secret to have a property named `password`, however, it still searches for `passphrase` (the default)
`proxy-status` and `authn tls-check` should function for istioctl.
using labels with slashes for subsets should be allowed.
yaml file having no conflict.
useful data in the spans.
it appears it's using the attributes `request.size` and `response.size` which extract their data from the `content-length`.
unfortunately, much of the data is chunked so rarely gives useful data.
it seems may work but this would also include headers and trailers in addition to body, although this may be preferred.
istio pods should be functional
installation should follow configuration specified in `values.yaml` file
an artifact exists to install cni
ingress gateways should recover after pod kill / termination
server which listen to pod ip should get traffic from istio proxy pellucidly.
bookinfos can be ran under consul
running integ phofhyperlink and e2e phofhyperlink tests on gke as documented should work, and needed binaries should be world-executable.
the service can be accessed normally during the upgrade
i want the rate limit can work.
when configuring the `poddnsconfig` for certmanager, the resulting `dnsconfig` field should be indented properly.
the upgrade documentation for helm setups should first instruct to delete and purge the `istio-init` release: phofcode deleting this release is necessary since upgrading it doesn 't work, e.g.
when attempting to upgrade from 1.1.7: phofcode deleting and purging the `istio-init` release is fine and safe.
`istioctl verify-install` should accept version as higher than `1.11`.
ideally error messages in prometheus metrics would be an enum or a short, bounded string.
we can get the full error messages from logs.
i 'd expect it to come up and shine all the time.
it looks like we can align with the envoy jwt filter allow jwt token without `exp` claim and this could be a quick change in the istio jwt filter.
(long time i think we will move to use the envoy jwt filter anyway, but that require more work) cc @qiwzhang @diemtvu
i have a gateway, virtualservice, service and a deployment configured.
i am having issues identifying where the source of a routing or communication issue might be.
when i try to send a grpc request using the grpc_cli client as shown below it fails: phofcode on investigation i find these messages are hitting the istio-ingressgateway as follows: kubectl logs -n istio-system - [libprotobuf info add new referenced for check cache: absence-keys: destination.port, destination.service, destination.uid, source.ip, exact-keys: context.protocol, context.reporter.kind, source.namespace, source.uid, "post 200 nr 7 0 9 - "10.1.1.1" "grpc-c++/1.21.2 grpc-c/7.0.0 (linux; chttp2; gandalf)" "-" - - so my grpc is getting into the system, all well and good.
phofcode however request should be responding with reflection results from my deployment container but gets an error, am assuming that requests must not be terminating on service have configured.
looked at istio-proxy for service to determine that no messages are seen entering pod, can see my standard outbound traffic successfully being responded to with other services in mesh.
the routes etc also look good.
chart versions are bumped, for at least the chart.
app version should probably be used properly or removed as well.
envoy sidecars should stay connected to pilot with mutual_tls enabled.
it should only be ready once envoy has moved from `initialising` to `live`
if there are & then we should see some error or warning logs in pilot pods
one misconfiguration should not impact existing networking behavior.
i expect the sidecar injector to manage it 's cabundle appropriately.
the blast radius of istio is _massive_, even more so when you're using mtls which is all rooted off a single certificate.
i expect citadel to correctly manage and rotate certificates in all parts of the certificate change, not just tick over 365 days and cause a cluster wide outage.
per my understanding, the traceid and spanid should in
the install does not fail because of a node port collision.
the locality based routing feature of serviceentry needs to support dns resolution, so that a service can specify its external endpoint as an fqdn that gets resolved to its available ip addresses automatically.
i think the correct behavior should be `404` or `502`, but maybe we can find some perfect answer.
- no secret * content * should be logged... ever - log level should be configurable through the helm chart - default level should be `info` or higher
the example code should work as described.
calls with urllib2 work as expected.
it would be nice to at least find the reason for this.
stats should be reset to 0 and the envoy proxy should work as expected
can perform normal tcp connection
`istio-ingressgateway` pods to get to ready state upon installation.
pods should be started automatically.
should be able to see metrics and tracing information in prometheus and jaeger.
core tracing services are running on control plane.
getting the real proxy-status of the pod
the validating admission controller should prevent this manifest from being applied.
if we give ability to configure url for grafana it should work.
i am ready to crerate pr with fix, but we should agree on the way how we want to fix this (e.g.
just add this additional property, allow user to override full configmap (gives ability for user make all available configurations for kiali))
able to set a running process like kubelet as a subject with granted access.
i have added a section in the below configuration that would be how i would kind of expect this to be working.
traffic should be routed through sidecars after cluster restart even without restarting the pods.
the istio-proxy starts correctly and the readiness probe succeeds.
deployment should has low impact on other services traffic.
tracing to be working in kiali when deployed using helm charts.
using the 1.1.7 chart index, i expect to be able to install the 1.1.7 version of the chart.
it should be inject and create sidecar to deployment.
all ports should be listening on ipv6 in pure ipv6 k8s cluster
enable to access our site
no 503 envoy should get ready faster
nothing should be running as root.
the default deployments should specifically define a non-0 uid runasuser in securitycontext section.
is there any reason to run any of the istio processes as root?
by now it should be basic best security practice to restrict uid 0 in podsecuritypolicy and require any deployments to explicitly set runasuser.
especially in the case of using istio-cni -- no container should require any elevated permissions except for the cni-installers.
there is no downside to this, as even for those who choose run insecure clusters without podsecuritypolicy, explicitly setting uid in a deployment will do no harm.
no errors when installing policy, egress and ingress components when using phofurl
i would expect the proxy to log that it rejected an external request.
having multiple pods for `istio-ingressgateway` deployment shouldn 't have a significant impact on latency.
external service should be accessible whenever the app container starts running.
after downloading realese archive, i can install istio with cni plugin following official documentation.
virtual hosts entry behavior should be the same for all ports.
i expected to see `x-backend: something` header
i'd expect to be able to have queries with more than 90 rows return without an issue, not just cause the connection to hang.
google cloud storage uri should not 404. the `istio.io/istio-init` chart should be available for download.
the requests are routed to a single backend consistently based on the hashed source ip.
see `istioctl proxy-config endpoints client-pod -o json --cluster ` with three backends, the endpoint configuration returned three hosts of equal weight.
also through testing i have witness the requests be round robin routed instead of consistently routed.
without config push, when mesh is stabilized, for a same outbound cluster x, we should expect the same `region`, `zone` info on all client side cds.
when enable istio, hpa could work correctly.
update must have been done smoothly.
it should use ipv6 localhost instead.
i think we can reuse fuction in cluster.go
i created a kind: envoyfilter and able to route the traffic to external auth service however my kubernetes readiness check endpoint /health shouldn't be routed to this external auth service.
that should be passing without authorization.
expected it to be able to retrieve the book info via an `https` call after applying the `serviceentry` per the example.
the spring cloud service can connect to config-server and get config to start up.
check requests should be sent to istio policy and be handled according to mixer's config.
assuming the following gateway configuration: phofcode netstat should return: phofcode however, in some corner case, the entries for 80 and 443 are missing causing connection refused errors (example: phofurl
expected https work fine after istio 1.1.5 upgrade metrics such as qps are on par of istio 1.1.3
listener ports shouldn 't be changed
it is working without manually creating imagepullsecret
rolling upgrade of the worker nodes should not affect the application pods
push only when crd change happens
sidecar proxy should respect grpc context timeout as a timeout for the whole request when retrying.
more crds created, 53 for cert manager not enabled
this should work as it did in istio 1.1.2
same helm releasename should be used
a lua script should never make the proxy crash, the script may fail and result in an http 500, but it should never crash.
when calling the end-point via gateway or from another service within a mesh, i would expect istio to apply a retry policy and return a 200ok.
no warning and the pod is running well.
all two replicas of the application should be evicted from the pool and the 503 response should be returned
these tests pass before the cluster hosting the test vault server was deleted.
the helm chart should configure galley with arg: .release.namespace }}`
a couple things: - the prestop sleep mitigates the race condition of removing the endpoint before the service is told to shut down - the default retry logic baked into istio 1.1 should mitigate this problem anyway
i would expect the endpoints to be removed right away.
the circuit breaker should be open.
connect to redis successfully by using serviceentry
when it should not matter what the values of the following values are: phofcode
kube-dns doesn 't crash due to overwhelming number of dns queries.
i would expect that the dns requests would be cached according to their ttl so the dns servers would repeatedly be queried.
should return a 421 and the browser should re-connect and successfully find the resource.
instead a 404 is returned.
the address would resolve to the ip address.
we 've verified that from the pilot discovery container `host` can resolve the hostname we 're trying to use.
if there is an error in phofurl i would expect it to be printed somewhere in the logs so we 're able to debug, instead of it silently failing.
(indeed, if it fails resolve these addresses due some temporary network issue during startup, that 's going cause serious problems with mesh.
it might be better simply crash out if given invalid config, rather than starting up and breaking all cross-cluster traffic)
https request should be sent from gateway to https service with simple mode.
scope claims with space delimited scopes work same as array.
istio-sidecar.deb package after installed on a vm, we are able to start envoy side car.
the same configuration was working in istio 1.0. it is not working in istio 1.1. as a workaround i am using the following configuration phofcode
expected the `proxyv2` image built from istio/proxy `release-1.1` would give the same result as the official version.
the user defined hub url should work when pulling images
i 'm expecting *.namespace to be set to "unknown" as well
envoy cluster config for externalname service should have single destination to the correct port for which the cluster config was generated
the pilot, the ingressgateway, and the egressgateway are running normally.
i would expect my external certificates to be synced into envoy proxies
invalid rules should notify user at the creation step
destinationrule should only be applied to in mesh clients and exclude istio-ingressgateway when sni passthrough is enabled for ingress
documented default timeout is actually what's used.
not sure if this is a documentation issue or an istio issue itself.
connection should not be reset.
if i disable encryption-in-transit in redis cluster, then `protocol: tcp` works fine.
ingress and envoy logs appear for all the incoming requests that reach ingress and envoy proxies.
pilot should not panic in the case of applying a working configuration following the push of bad multicluster configuration.
endpoints should be removed from envoy very quickly after they are removed from k8s.
i can reach another namespace(istio not enabled) service through `test` but can 't reach services running on `default`
wget success get data from url
tcp `gateway` works without `http` port.
expected to route to the database specified by the dns name (and getting rejected from connecting to www.google.com)
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
every request to haproxy gets delayed by 10s and ends with timeout (after 5s).
grafana and prometheus ui should work on non-root contextpath
expected the ssl connection to complete successfully
catch the exception and log proper error if needed.
- if envoy throws error istio-pilot should also throw error and do not allow multiple virtual services on same domain.
- config_dump shouldn 't show multiple virtualhost with duplicated domains in same route_config because they are not applied(config_dump should show configurations which are applied).
statsinclusionprefixes can apply to ingressgateway, or there is another way to configure ingressgateway to record statistics for inbound or outbound traffic.
in the documentation, you mention that the wildcard prefix is accepted, but it throws this error: `* hosts must be fqdn if no endpoints are provided for resolution mode dns` in your code: phofurl i see that you call
envoy inbound access logs in another cluster.
a gauge metric to be successfully logged into stackdriver.
#run following with many egress serviceentries and virtualservice entries and it should suceed kubectl apply -f egress-control.yml
`docker.kubectl` is within the docker_targets, i should be able to have the container image built successfully.
it to work as designed (begin switching traffic from one subset to another.)
either : - we can use dots in `gateway` names - galley should reject the creation of a gateway with a dot in the name
i expect the authentication policy to take precedence over the mixer authorization check.
a 401 should be returned due to a failure to meet the authentication policy, and a 403 should be returned if the subject met authentication policy but did not meet authorization constraints configured in mixer.
503s with "upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers" are retried by default.
i can access the service with the ` phofurl in other pods.
since k8s externalname service is a native k8s feature, i expect istio side car should support it.
this affects knative eventing where we us k8s external service (in user namespace) to route events to a common dispatcher service (in knative eventing namespace)
both original and mirrored requests should have landed on the same pod applying the consistent hash
helm chart.yml should point to correct versions 1.0.7.
the ssl certificate gets dynamically created without reseting the connection, so on the first connection to port 443 the cert is made available and ssl/tls just work.
we expect spans to show as per the example.
running the latest phofhyperlink docker image produces a site without broken glyphicon fonts
the request should stop in about 1 second, instead of 2, and the reviews should be unavailable
the end user authentication should have worked for istio enabled private gke cluster as well
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
installing istio with and sds enabled works.
the red star is not showing
the initial envoy config should contain `podip:8000` and goes healthy right after it gets the inital config from pilot
new values for map in yaml to be accepted
the curl on port 80 returns a 404-not found.
the resource utilization of istio-pilot should be consistent between the versions
i expected to get 200 response without providing the jwt token
i expect istio to accept connections.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
the galley dashboard to be populated.
i expected i could still apply `yaml` that was used before.
behavior as seen in 1.0.6
istio-proxy/pilot should intercept and route traffic for services.
the request should return http 200 with some json (array of articles)
an ip address is allowed for a service entry.
our mesh is configured with registry_only and our application needs to access the aws ec2 metadata endpoint at have tried phofcode as a hopeful workaround, but this doesnt work either.
a serviceentry should only take effect in the namespace where it is defined, and not apply to all namespaces in the cluster.
that way, whether by malicious intent or honest mistake, a user can only disrupt traffic of one 's own namespace and not for the whole cluster.
missing the destination rule from documentation
if mtls is enabled, the citadel is critical component who 's failure can result in traffic disruption.
it would be appropriate to have citadel 's metrics scraped by default (at least with mtls on)
as the tutorial says - it should show the ratings
do not return any difference
the should select pods, not services.
no looging messages with response.code <400
wget success get data from url
cluster-aware-gateway should have come up fine.
the ingress gateway in cluster-1 would forward requests to the remote service at endpoint to the remote (cluster-2) ingress gateway which would then use sni to properly route the request within cluster-2.
i expected subject.user to be parsed correctly
`curl` to the ` phofurl should work as well.
see the product page after applying the exclusion by namespace
the `istio-policy` pod starting to run successfully
expected the crds deployment of istio-init to be upgraded to 1.1.1, as the same process is successful in upgrading istio itself.
metric is accurately reported to the dashboard.
well, i expected it to work...
like in the tutorial, should get 200 from services
correct the typo to "copy to clipboard"
per phofurl mentions, at least `curl localhost:8080/ready` shouldn't time out with this ipv4 cluster.
all envoy proxies are stable and do not keep reloading
traffic should work just fine within the same namespace when no policies have been applied
installed istio and created 3 deployments using istioctl kube-inject.
apiserver status keeps changing between error, stopped and running state very frequently.
host: running kubelet: running apiserver: error expectation is to ensure curl commands works for the service that was exposed.
grafana and kiali continue to show data.
i expected to see logs on the ingressgateway while i 'm creating resource like gateway or virtualservice, also i expected to access the bookinfo example through the ingressgateway
i should be able to make both http and https requests to the elb for the `httpbin.example.com` host, have them routed to the httpbin service, and see the expected responses.
galley to run without error
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
when port 80 is not opened, the ingressgateway is mapped to node port such as 3xx80, in http 1.0, the host header of client request contained port as default.
if the virtualservice 's host can not contain port 3xx80, the request can not be matched, which results in a 404 error.
before close galley can solve problem, which can create virtualservice successfully, but galley is much more important now such as mcp.
so i think we should support it
i expected to see the string representation of the ip address.
the client should reconnect to the server when it restarts.
galley pods should be running without issue
istio egress to allow traffic without any error.
no such binding of vs to a gateway for which the vs was not defined
istio should run successfully using the default helm install values.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
pods should be able to communicate with other pods in same mesh.
`<title>simple bookstore app</title>` should be returned
pods should be able to call themselves on their headless-generated endpoint.
liveness probe requests should not regularly get failures.
i definitely did not have this problem on an environment of this small size in ~1.0.3.
i believe that setting to `none` should disable the init container and therefore iptables redirect configuration.
the envoy outbound cluster configuration should be set to the correct cluster.
i expected all of the containers to run.
i have another cluster where everything is working normally.
after defining and configuring an egressgateway to allow http traffic to hit the url as in the egress gateway for http traffic phofhyperlink example, the expectation was that we would get a `200` response back from the http request.
instead request returns with a `404` response: phofcode
have a way to let a service communicate outside of the mesh.
istioctl should return proxy config and sync diff with `proxy-config` and `proxy-status` respectively for remote proxies
port name should not be necessary unique, since the gateways are in different namespaces, and ingressgateway should route correctly.
we have tested http, which works correctly and we hope https has same behavior.
i expected the fields to all be recognized and appropriately passed to my grpc adapter which will perform the appropriate adjudication.
mixer server change the handler address to a new one that config yaml specifies.
traces are displayed as the examples.
liveness/readiness probes should exhibit the same behavior in both local cluster and remote cluster.
replica set is able to post to sidecar, get automatic injects and create istio-proxied pods.
i would expect to see `eds` instead of `&{eds}`, etc.
also, i would expect blackholecluster to be `static` not `<nil>`
it should serve all the request over http2.
connection should be possible by using gateway and virtual service from istio.
able to run e2e tests on my own gke cluster.
i would expect the rc3 control plane to accept the edit successfully.
the current state of available pods/ips per service to be correctly distributed in the mesh.
no regression in pod+sidecar startup time.
`gateway` objects with differing `port` dictionaries should be respected within their own namespaces.
in the example above, phofurl should fail as only http traffic is allowed.
dns should not fail to resolve in a default setup, especially with an `outboundtrafficpolicy` of `allow_any`.
i expected the fqdn ` to be the value for `host`
gateway rules in istio-remote cluster take effect.
i should be able to do many requests as i want to and receive a 200 in all of them since my pods are healthy
default was changed to only create ingress, update chart to reflect that
when the envoy sidecar receives an update, service is not interupted
`telemetry-gateway` sub-chart should not be installed if default ingress gateway is disabled.
destinationrules should respect the sidecar scope.
in this case, no destinationrule should be used for the reviews service, unless we add it to the sidecar scoping.
given the below output: `[hostname ansible]# kubectl version client version: version.info{major:"1", minor:"13", gitversion:"v1.13.4", gittreestate:"clean", goversion:"go1.11.5", compiler:"gc", platform:"linux/amd64"} server version: version.info{major:"1", minor:"13", gitversion:"v1.13.3", gittreestate:"clean", goversion:"go1.11.5", compiler:"gc", platform:"linux/amd64"}` the playbook should continue installation, but it fails.
ingress gateway should route traffic based on weighted configuration defined in a virtualservice with mtls enabled for tcp protocol.
{{ getting the istio-ingressgateway services external ip should succeed. }}
a plain helm installation should result in a running pilot.
of course anybody can update the configmap himself, but it would be good to know a good value for this seemingly new parameter.
the number should be "1.0.6"
{{ creating control plane for the master cluster should succeed. }}
client side should be able to talk to server.
{{ the role binding should be set for all clusters. }}
even pilot crashes, all istio applications should also work without traffic drops.
pods of one app from two clusters are registered in different pilot services entries.
{{ creating clusters should succeed }}
{{ curl should succeed }}
should be able to setup
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
master and slave should be able to sync successfully
it should be possible to expose services that don 't have an istio-proxy via the istio-ingressgateway.
i would have thought only a single timeseries would result for this.
curl -o /dev/null -s -w "%{http_code} " ==>200
update egress-https phofhyperlink part docs, to tell us that we should use new objects to replace the old ones.
per instructions, 58 should be printed
istio should not overcommit and request an excessive amount of cpu from kubernetes.
istio sidecar injection should be concurrent with k8s pod creation
expect pilot to start and not exit immediately.
logging of metrics to stdio is possible
the istio-ingressgateway and the istio-egressgateway readiness probe succeeds.
the istio control plane starts.
client sends: * `x-b3-sampled: 0`: istio and underlying receiver
to either works smoothly or at least mention that the egress-gateway has to be restarted.
seperating it into 2 steps should be enough.
the templated istio-remote-auth.yaml is created.
the reviews part of the page displays with no rating stars, no matter how many times you refresh.
{{ jaeger console detects and displays bookinfo services }}
i 'd expect that after installing istio, and then the that all the nginx-ingress-controller pods had the envoy proxy sidecar injected.
- mixer should not reference a nil address memory
* pilot shouldn 't push xds configuration to envoy if no changes * established downstream connections shouldn 't be destroyed by envoy unless the upstream service closes the connection itself.
no 503 on first call
metrics collected for jaeger process.
mixer traces to be part of the distributed traces for the parent requests.
install the istio-init chart to bootstrap all the istios crds should succeed.
{{ doc matches productpage.py source }}
not sure why there is change behavior from 1.0.0 to 1.0.5, but i expect that it should be able to provision the custom ingress gateway controller 's resources/dependencies (e.g: service account, etc) in different namespace.
egress gateway envoy proxy log should display the curl request track.
when serviceentries are deleted the memory that was claimed before should be freed again.
the page should show the v1 review page every time.
{{ kubectl apply -f succeeds }}
prometheus data should be stored in a persistent volume by default
{{ the documented command (see below) should cause a conflict: kubectl -n istio-system apply -f - <<eof apiversion: kind: "destinationrule" metadata: name: "bad-rule" spec: host: trafficpolicy: tls: mode: disable eof }}
{{ destination rule default/istio-system }}
it gets complicated, but the simple answer that helps me most is to have a match count if it matches any header with the same name.
the complicated answer that needs more thought is related to spec processing of such duplicate headers, and how they are treatable as a comma separated list.
(an `exact` match today only works if it matches the first occurrence of the named header, and if we treat duplicates as a list, then arguably exact match shouldn 't have matched, but it did, so i suspect simple answer is easiest to implement without breaking behavior for existing requests)
{{ health check succeeds, httpbin pod does not fail and restart }}
fortio as client deployment should succeed.
only new version 1.1.0-snapshot6 of mixer should exists.
the annotation values shall be double quoted.
either the above files/folder should be in tar or some snippet should be there from where user and easily download them.
istio skips invalid hostname or crashes with severe error.
kiali to be able to access istio-pilot's previous /version endpoint so it can figure out what version of istio it is deployed in.
get response from the configured service.
when a sidecar resource has a `workloadselector`, it should be used to select pods for which the restrictions should be applied.
{{ doc should reference or should be added to release }}
applications with tls mode simple and passthrough should work in the same cluster
rendering to k8s manifest should finish successfully.
if sampling is enabled, the mixer adapter check results should also appear in the logs.
the jwt validation should always be working with relatively low qps.
grafana to work (like in 1.0.5)
i expect both serviceentries to function even if both charts are deployed
- grafana and prometheus metrics work find in selected namespaces too
gateway resource that does not specify a certificate path should be accepted by galley given that the sds agent loads the certificates dynamically from the api server.
it should working fine by terminate the ssl in the first layer gateway
test environment won't be destroyed if this flag is set.
tests should be able to run.
locality aware routing should fall back to locality of side car service instances when both i) locality is not set or ii) empty locality is set on side car.
expect to be able to use attributes in 1.1 namely request.query_params and request.url_path as specified in the docs
one service name is used so that telemetry is consistent.
perhaps there could be an annotation that marks a service as the canonical service to use in policy and telemetry.
with none of the inject demanding `privileged: true`, a psp with false` and `cap_net_admin` enabled should satisty the requirements to successfully deploy a pod with the sidecar injected.
i have proved this by removing the namespace label `istio-injecion` (to disable automatic sidecar injection) and using manual sidecar injection using `istioctl kube-inject -f httpbin.yaml` to generate and apply modified spec.
in this case deployment succeeds with aforemention psp.
somebody have mercy and fix kube-inject
the istio-system to be correctly installed
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
the 'global' destination rule should have the least precedence.
{{ .release.namespace }}.svc.cluster.local` instead of `frontend.
the startup of pod+sidecar should be as fast possible (knative requirement).
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
i understand the cross-service order is undefined but this configuration shouldn 't break the virtual services involved and specially not unrelated services.
if what caused the error is the "mesh" gateway, then documentation needs to be updated.
for uri 's filtered web sockets must be working.
exec: `kubectl -n istio-system port-forward $(kubectl -n istio-system get pod -l app=kiali -o and connect to: phofurl
cpu and memory within requested size
with sds enabled and true` `istio-proxy` should be able to connect to the control plan.
i believe that this condition phofhyperlink should be on and will need to be addressed in both the `istio` and `istio-remote` charts.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
the upgrade should be successful
envoy proxy should write log with new format.
expecting `helm install` command to work.
when deleting the istio-system namespace, the admission controller registration is revoked such that no automatic injection is attempted.
the test case should work appropriately.
if the external jaeger/zipkin is specified, the address should be used consistently throughout.
with `mode: mutual` specified in the `tlssettings`, i would expect this to be correctly classified at mtls client connection.
everything to start up and running well
independent of request frequency, a proven working outbound endpoint should always be reachable from the sidecar.
per operations guide, running `curl phofurl from within an istio-ingressgateway pod should return a response.
it instead gets a connection timeout.
istio-auth.yaml to be applied without error if possible.
panic: unknown map type []uint8 goroutine 2342 [running]: 0xc421aadad7, 0x7, 0x1, +0x149 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, ...) +0x47a7 0x102, ...) +0xd4 0x2df8ad0, +0x80 +0x184 0x1e88bf7) +0x54
all ports declared in the container
parsing the sentence with standard english semantic rules, i expected that specifying a gateways field with the single value `mesh` would apply the rules to both gateways and sidecars.
envoy bootstrap templatefile passed as an argument to pilot-agent should be handled exactly the same as default bootstrap template, effectively substituting the default template.
i want to run 2 envoy proxies in one pod - istio sidecar shouldn't crash
i expect pilot to continue pushing rds to envoy after pilot is restarted without having to restart envoy.
the telemetry should only have the "unknown" timeseries that you see above in the prometheus screenshot: phofcode the other three that show a destination_service of "details" but destination_workload of "reviews-v[123]" are incorrect and should not be there at all.
i would expect version 1.0.5 to be returned by istioctl proxy-status
we expected the behavior described in the doc.
i expect being able to invoke functions that are statically linked, in particular openssl.
have a `istio-sec-` header with the jwt payload
i expect traffic mirroring to have the same telemetry as "normal" traffic.
specifically, i expected to see source telemetry (reporter="source") for the "first hop" of the mirrored traffic.
the following serviceentry should succeed.
when `autoscaleenabled: true`, don't include the unneeded `replicas: 1` for deployments.
add templating logic around the deployment template replica definition: phofcode
envoy and node agent 's sds grpc server should be able to communicate successfully.
if the sds grpc server 's serve() returns an error, the communication should resume for subsequent connections.
the destinationrule to be applied when a service is consumed should be resolved in the following order - search the namespace where the service is being consumed - search the namespace where service is defined - search a default 'root' namespace under administrator control.
default should be 'istio-system' but should be overrideable.
when the container(s) that are declared as part of the job complete successfully, the job should be marked as successful, per normal kubernetes operation.
changes to be reflected immediately and my service to be accessible on hostname:31380/
i'm not sure there's really a solution here, but it makes istio-cni practically unusable on clusters that frequently up and down-scale since it almost always requires manual intervention to resolve issues where pods have started with the wrong network sandbox.
perhaps istio-cni should be watching the node it started on and periodically verify that the configuration has been set correctly.
additionally, istio-cni could delete all pods that started before the configuration was applied.
no errors while processing the list resource object.
only healthy gateway should be added to the fleet to receive traffic.
no failure messages in the logs.
all the arguments for envoy can be feed in via pilot-agent proxy command line
istio multicluster resolution works cross-cloud without modification of applications.
my pod makes a series of calls to the gcp metadata server and successfully retrieves credentials with expected gke auth scopes.
expected the oop adapter graphs to be populated
according to pr phofurl in version 1.1.0-snapshot4 kubernetesenv adapter on mixer should be able to connect to the remote cluster to get pod information.
all ingress gateway replicas should be taking traffic.
envoy proxy configuration is easily configurable via istio objects.
requests coming from an internal nginx gateway outside the k8s cluster can be recognised as internal requests so `x-request-id`s don 't get overwritten.
i would expect that the attribute `source.workload.uid` contains the id of the deployment where the request originated, not one where mixer check is executed.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
i want the pod and pod 's status get running and do not restart always.
i expect to be able to connect to aws cognito from a pod with sidecar.
expected tcp server to see connection immediately when client establishes a connection.
no goroutine leak no memory leak
run istio-iptables.sh return no error eternally
i expect that it should be possible to set response headers conditionally.
mixer should not emit a warning in such cases.
exactly access the url by chrome.
below output is with istio-vm user, we are expecting same output with root user.

deleted istio as: `helm del --purge istio` tried installing istio again using the helm chart.
it reported: phofcode crds should have been removed for a clean removal of istio.
expected the service to return a valid response
when using ipv4 istio does not intercept/block connections to localhost.
i would expect the same behavior when using ipv6 localhost address `::1`
disabling mtls setting should not create secrets of existing deployments.
~~~ kubectl get secrets -n curlworld name type data age default-token-tlx6w 3 7m istio.default istio.io/key-and-cert 3 4m ~~~
services in other namespace which is not allowed in destinationrule shouldn 't be able to contact the service for which the policy is implemented.
red stars in the review -- going to version 3 of the review microservice.
there should be no error for an acceptable request rate for this case.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
i want the end route to be to the one i rewrite this is the route created, and you can see in the decorator that it does not get rid of "trs-tulip" prefix: and this way it does not get traffic also.
i expect to reach the is4 's welcome page when entering phofurl address.
i expect the pod in namespace "a" to be able to reach the cockroachdb service in namespace "b" with or without sidecar injection turned on.
localhost to localhost connectivity should not be affected by istio at all.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
how to solve this problem(low version didn 't suport the example tcp load balancing) in the lower version?
after applying the `productpage` should only render v1 reviews
if a request is made to the service with token signed by a new key, envoy is able to fetch new jwks configuration in order to authenticate the token.
application/custom metrics should be scraped with or without mtls enabled.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
pod can request the egress cluster well.
mixer can ouput correct metrics in kubernetes v1.7.10
if istio can replace the special char , or any better solution?
istio should get installed with out any issues
allow scraper to collect metrics from ports that are not under the sidecar umbrella.
ex: we could have the common annotation "prometheus.io/scheme" being read here to determine if we want to force usage of non-secure job "kubernetes-pods"
checking ansible version can be done locally.
i would suggest add another argument `grpc_address` or `grpc_port`.
and i am happy to contribute code
it should return nodes about productpage
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
when i keep refreshing the page( phofurl i should see resource_exhausted:quota is exhausted for: requestcount.
i hope both of the two rules should take effect
the `runasuser: 0` configuration is currently not present in the istio-sidecar-configmap by default.
would expect this to be present by default since it 's required to run `iptables`
expect the istio installed with zipkin
remote istio on remote cluster keep crashing due to below error `error: failed to create injection webhook failed to convert to proto.
yaml: line 60: mapping values are not allowed in this context`
addons use https by default.
proxy sds service spots the filesystem change and restarts the proxy automatically.
routes should be identified as matching.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
- an upgrade should not break service connectivity - if there is a cache there should be a way to clear it
http 200 for metrics as per the first few days of collection.
we should cache services and service instances in pilot and watch consul for update.
i expected the helm chart to clean up after itself.
job should be deleted if chart install failed.
when i add a new dimension to my yaml, that new dimension should be reported through my custom metric to my custom adapter.
when i remove a dimension it should not be reported anymore.
pilot should consume reasonable cpu since its not a calculation intensive component
pilot to start without crashing
k8s original quotas should not be hidden.
but with `istio-1.1.0.snapshot.1` it works fine phofcode
policy disabled but telemetry to be enabled.
validating a header map will make sure the header name is not empty.
the pilot and policy pods are running
pilot should handle the protocol error response and continue to serve routes to the sidecar
all connections to the postgres service work.
refreshing routes to v1,v2, and v3 equally
as suggested in this test at istio repo phofhyperlink , 'the paths with wild cards at the end of the path' must macth.
for a rule ` * /reviews/ * ` requests phofurl and phofurl both must match.
apart from query string parameters must not be considered for rule maching for e.g.
phofurl should match the rule.
should be able to access this service over port 8000.
the gateway should offer up intermediate certs.
chrome/firefox are ok without the intermediate certs, but most everything else needs it and fails (eg.
non-tls port 80 is ok too.
all curl commands to complete successfully once policy mixer has restarted.
{{ what did you expect to happen? }}
it should return hello version.
`[centos@myinstance ~]$ curl phofurl hello version: v2, instance: `
pods continue to work as before.
grpc client was able to connect to the service, with or without the sidecar proxy
istio gateway can handle grpc service,
`helm install` should run to completion.
the istio kubectl container built with a kubectl executable usable in the arch set in the build 's goos setting.
route traffic only to healthy pods.
only proxy to pod running.
helm upgrade adds crds as required
have hpa enabled by default for these components.
more precisely, it should use the 'plaintex ' filter chain, and then get tls terminated at backend app.
i get a response from the service in clusterb accessing through the mcgateway on that same cluster.
expected the test to pass successfully or at least not fail on code internals
when using `--export` the kubernetes-generated elements should be completely omitted
i 'm expecting for the requests to be routed to a different version based on the weight specified against each version.
when the url is invoked i see the following error.
cors header should be responsed.
session affinity to apply on top of weighted subsets.
so user will randomly be sent to a version based on the assigned weight, and once they get to that version, they will continue being served that version.
external endpoints should be reachable from the pod.
our application connects to the following type of external endpoints.
- endpoints in same vpc in aws as kubernetes cluster vpc - endpoints in different vpc in aws from k8s vpc - completely external endpoints.
note : using service entry will not fix my issue, because of number of external endpoint it is very difficult to identify all and enable it.
i have my out of process adapter running and i expected the server to send the report call request to my out of proces adapter, very similar to the metric template.
pilot receive signal from terminating pod 's sidecar and delete it 's endpoint record.
no warning from helm, and `kubectl get svc/istio-ingressgateway --namespace istio-system -o yaml ` containing configured
all requests should be delayed by 15 seconds.
pilot should be able to handle large number of services without
stateful set members should be reachable when hit from inside the cluster.
all endpoints to be up for envoy-stats target.
querying prometheus to return metrics.
we would expect, that the sidecar ignores the missing certificates, as it doesn 't need them.
this seems to be the behavior in 1.0. or some method to specify the gateway, where destination rule should be active.
use servicemeta instead of nodemeta to convey the protocol and other service properties.
servicemeta has been supported by consul at this commit: phofurl
the typical mixer e2e test completes within 30-90s (mainly based on a prometheus-related sleep time meant to proactively prevent flakiness).
the two `testredisquota...` tests should finish in that timeframe.
that would save ~12m of testing time.
be able to create a deployment
if the bag of attributes that form the cache key is different, the cache should miss.
in the example above no cache hit would happen given that one of values in instance changes.
the x-forwarded-proto header should be: ``x-forwarded-proto: https``
port c should either be added to the sidecar or not added to iptables.
one can deploys n handlers to the same adapter and, each time a specific handler is used, the adapter will receive the correct adapterconfig, which has been writtent on that specific handler.
i should be able to create both the following types of servers on gateways (residing on the same egress-gateway pod): * server.protocol: https, server.tls.mode: mutual * server.protocol: tls, server.tls.mode: mutual
if it so happened that istio must have diffenent port names to differentiate https gateways, it should not expect to have https port.
it must work without any gateways having port named "https"
maybe the destination rule can separate the service entry by endpoint labels?
helm template to build the full yaml that i can use to apply via kubectl or oc.
shouldn't have affected the default namespace
access should be fine just like only serviceentry applied
old endpoints are deleted from envoy cluster.
* an example configuration should be complete * if for some reason an example configuration can not be copied-and-pasted, it should be mentioned explicitly
i expected my handler to receive a message
network should be available when my program starts executing.
if the helm folder is included in release assets, it should include all the files needed to install via the helm chart.
passing a header of "authorization" when the instance config is set to collect a header of "authorization" should work.
since http is case insensitive, either authorization or authorization should be acceptable in the config.
we expect to have the requests routed to the service or a way to find if there is something missing in the configuration.
build should not be break on master branch
istio dev wiki need to modify golang version to 1.10 or higher.
better to 1.11 or higher.
i should be able to send an email via the mailjet smtp.

an istio-policy pod restarting should not prevent connectivity to cluster services.
success same as no istio injected.
not entirely sure, but it seems like `500` is incorrect.
there wasn 't any internal server error; the client disconnected so envoy correctly aborted processing.
maybe initialize the request_data response code to `499` which according to phofurl is for client disconnected before processing is complete
use the same hostip with different ingress gateway ports can distinguish different kubernetes services.
unresponsive oop adapters should eventually time out.
i would expect these resources to be really namespace-bound, so it's possible to isolate applications into namespaces.
what are the rules for defining port numbers to the applications?
can port 8080 be served by different services if they have type clusterip?

running istio does not significantly increase the failure rate of liveness probes.
while the requirement for "http-" prefix is touched upon here: phofurl this requirement is not obvious in other parts of documentation and examples.
other projects stumbled upon this as well and took a while to pin-point.
same service definitinios used were confirmed to work in previous versions.
since it was a new version migration problem for us (from 1.0.0), i 'm opening it as issue so that others can find it quicker.
possibility of handling it as a separate setting instead of a "prefix" was discussed here: phofurl similar settings and behavior is explicitly different and described in documentation here: phofurl including separate "protocol" setting port name without "http-" prefix.

grafana pod should be in running state
all istio deployment components, when installed, will give the pods they create/manage proper app and version labels - this is to ensure metric collection for those pods can be labeled properly.
in the case of version labels (which look to be the ones missing) the deployment should simply give pods a version label whose value is same value as version label that is on deployment itself.
should start pod with sidecar container.
gdb works, at the very least when using `proxy_debug` image.
metrics depending on `request.duration` should work like any other metrics.
virtualservice should be found using the phofcode selector and should be able to forward traffic to the corresponding phofcode .

i expect to connect with telnet to the service, and send a ping, to see if it is connected correctly.
`x-forwarded-for` header should contain valid client 's ip, and ingress gateway should sanitize and/or strip untrusted values before forwarding requests to backend services.
note that we should account for trusted load balancers being deployed in front of ingress gateway and forwarding valid client 's ip using this header.
no negative impact to other services when installing istio.

the metric data is same as datas on grafana page
no errors when loading the configuration for my adapter.
i 'm expecting istio to, at minimum, put an `app` label and `version` label on everything (as this is the istio recommendation for customer 's to use, i think istio 's demo yaml should follow that recommendation as well - it will also help label istio 's own telemetry data).
the `release-name` label also seems odd - probably should be some project version codename or something.

istio gateway supports grpc and the wget command works after the command "istioctl kube-inject" being executed.
istioctl replace -f should work

a1(a,version1) running outside the cluster, its ip is and port is 9000, meanwhile b running inside, b send a request to a with a ip host like this: phofurl now i want to running a2(a, version2) inside, and want to transfer requests for certain rules a2.
i used serviceentry and virtualservice ,but it not work.
the config as below: service entry: apiversion: kind: serviceentry metadata: name: a1 spec: hosts: - location: mesh_external ports: - number: 9000 name: a1 protocol: http resolution: none virtual service apiversion: kind: virtualservice metadata: name: a spec: hosts: - gateways: - mesh http: match: uri: prefix: "/user/info" port: 9000 route: destination: host: a2.a.svc.cluster.local port: number: 9000
the bookinfo example should run correctly by following the steps in the istio documentation.
request to service httpbin should be timed out immediately.
the expectation is for the mysampleadapter_test.go file to execute and spit out data in the out.txt file.
however, this file does not get created.
when policy=disabled the sidecar injector will not inject the sidecar into pods by default.
add the sidecar.istio.io/inject annotation with value true to the pod template spec to enable injection.
by rfc, the `host:` header of http can be the plain `<host>` or `<host>:<port>`.
the virtualservice should consider the two as beeing the same.
i expect the helm charts work, when i follow steps from official documentation
i expected the pilot pod to run without crashing.
the default tag value should match the latest tag on docker hub (currently `0.8.0`).
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
able to follow the docs and connect securely.
the installation should succeed the first run.
no loadbalancers should be assigned when you disable the ingress, it's not wanted to expose the query / ui endpoints publicly?
correct links in html to the images
routerules or vs should function correctly for traffic shifting
for example, if `zipkin` is not part of the istio control-plane installation, the whole selectorless services section and endpoints section for `zipkin` should not be included in the resulting manifest.
should be able to access pod via two ports: one http, another https.
pod registration should work exactly as it does on clusters with the default cluster domain.
be able to successfully update a deployment which in turn creates a replicaset.
i expect helm install to result in a successful deployment.
make test should work in both go 1.9.6 and 1.10.
not sure if this is a bug or desired behavior, but the error message is lacking imo, i spent 30 minutes looking for the cause of this.
the docs state > even if your form is empty by default, you must initialize all fields with initial values otherwise react will throw an error saying that you have changed an input from uncontrolled to controlled.
about the initialvalues, but i did not get the input uncontrolled/controlled error.
also it works with an empty object as initialvalues so maybe default on initialvalues should be an empty object?
i 'd expect that nested values in arrays would be "touched" on submit
i am updating the value of menu2 in componentdidupdate when formik.values.menu1 changes.
i feel like calling `setfieldvalue('menu2,' '')` should be safe.
i wanted my validation process to express all fields as required as soon as one of the three fields is set.
i inspired myself from this example phofhyperlink .
i expect setin to return empty object, { }, as the errors to setformikstate when there are no validation errors.
choice 2 should be checkable, just like if i 'd used string values.
`fastfield` only re-renders when it's own field updates.
use initialvalues from props when we use resetform handler, same as formik 1.
typing for touched should respect array types.
i'd like it so the shape remains the same, and it can validate against my yup validation: phofcode
formik should be calling `uselayouteffect` in react native.
validationschema should work as before with date validation
no error but working component on the project pages.
`fieldprops.field.value` is typed like the value property, or before it was any because of the difficulty in typing that.
when passing to an input and spreading `<input {...fieldprops.field} />` you'll get no type errors.
validation should be called on the newly set values.
works as expected with formik 1.5.8
as in v1 phofcode and phofcode state should be false after calling phofcode with the new values.
i would expect the checkbox to work as it should and follow the internal value
isvalid prop to reflect the actual validity of the form at all times.
due to initialerrors, validating on mount automatically may be undesirable, which is understandable.
so in this case, explicitly setting validateonmount=true should definitely ensure isvalid prop's value on mount is correct.
no error should be thrown.
in `v1.5.8`, this import works as expected.
in version 1.x, validation was run right away.
when the `<field />` component array changes, they should be initialized according to their own intialvalues.
if the validation fails, submitform should throw errors
it should check and update value array instantly .
the input field in the formik form should not re-render unless the props passed to the form have changed.
i figure resetform in an onsubmit is roughly like enablereinitialize, but obviously semantically different.
for my case, initialvalues do change from the parent after submission, but those should be ignored after first render.
you should be able to call `insert` when there is an error on the array.
i expect to be able to find the corresponding line and column number of the original source file if i can provide the line and column number of the transpiled esm output and its sourcemap.
i would expect the function to complete without error.
thereby making select multiple lists work properly.
`handlechange` is always returning a function so it shouldn't have `void` in its return types
no error should be thrown.
i expect to check the validation of the email input field ## | software | version(s) | | ---------------- ---------- formik |1.5.8 react |16.6.0 typescript browser |chrom npm/yarn operating system
fastfield components should only rerender when its own value is changed.
all format which doesn 't include in my supported formats array should be rejected by the validation
expect formik validation and onsubmit to fire when render prop `form` wraps around a popup rendered inside a react portal.
`isvalid` should not be set to `true` upon checkbox state change
i would expect `issubmitting` to be true until it's set to false in the onsubmit function.
form should show errors messages onblur of <field component={owncomponent} />
nested keys should be allowed as a field key in formikhelpers functions.
being able to remove answers without formik throwing
it only appears on the newest version `2.0.1-rc.10` and i saw the comment in the release.
i wanted to be 100% sure if this use case will not be supported in the future.
with v1, i used `isinitialvalid` which forced all fields to be changed, and thus validated, before isvalid becomes true.
currently, i am using `initialerrors` with empty string on those required fields so, on the one hand, `isvalid` is false and the error text, being an empty string, is _falsy_ and doesn't distract the user with spurious error messages.
(actually, i get `initialerrors` filled in based on what i get from analyzing what `schema.describe` and checking for required fields)
`<formik />` should only validate fields inside tags.
i want resetform call and clear the form when the button placed in header is triggered | software | version(s) | | ---------------- ---------- formik 1.4.0 react 16.8.3
`isvalidating` should update even onblur and onchange i checked in `react-final-form`, and it does the correct thing there, updating `validating`.
field marked as touched and error shows.
i don 't expect the form to submit when i click any button that does not have `type="submit"` or has the submit handler explicitly set on the button.
storybook should run and have access to `__dev__`
when calling `withformik<outprops, the type of `valuestotest` should be `partial<formvalues>`
the field is included (with an empty value).
i expect that only field which i type in should be rerendered.
when i change initialvalues, i expect a "dirty = false" with the new values, for example when i update a form then ask my server to refetch data.
i would expect a warning to throw only if `<field as>` was explicitly set by the user alongside passing `<field children>`.
when i downgraded my version to formik 1.5.4, everything works like expected.
it should avoid it as it was doing on react 16.2
i expect `fieldarray.pop` to have the same side effects as `fieldarray.remove`
neither hoc not component should be unmounted during onchange, and it should behave the same regardless of whether we use hoc or not
formik should run its normal validation and submit process.
production and development builds work the same way.
expected all initial inputs to be touched.
the itself ought to return the yup `objectschema` instead of an object wrapper whose property contains this `objectschema`
storybook is up and running on `localhost:9001` without rendered at-loader errors
cursor stays on current position.
the error messages not to be mixed up between the two forms.
formik should keep the class methods and prototype when the form updates at top level.
the value should be "johnny.wang@nscorp.com" === mappropstovalues === object {email: formik values: object {email:
the same code works in an actual browser.
not really sure that this is a formik issue, it might be what enzyme passes as the `event` that isn 't correct?
setsubmitting(true) should set issubmitting to `true`
validation errors in child form should not trigger validation on the parent as well.
it looks like `validateonblur` reset the touched fields.
i 'm able to submit the form like on 1.3.2 if i disable `validateonblur` the form completly
the code should compile successfully, with the supplied react element assigned to `formik.errors.name`.
i would expect that: - when you remove a field from the form, the related value is removed from `values`.
- when rendering a new field it should add its initial value to `values` so when submitting you can see the related errors for that field (maybe adding an `initialvalue` prop for the field component and setting that in values object in `componentdidmount`).
what i'm doing right now to fix this is running a custom `onchange` function in first input and according to value, using `setvalues` to remove old key of dependent input and adding a default for new key.
to have a `touched` object shape to only contain fields with booleans as values, just like it did pre `1.3.1`.
textarea fields should be rendered as multiline textarea field with drag handle
before formik `1.4.0`, everything works as fine.
when users click on the `select` component, its `onchange()` handler got triggered, which calls `handlechange()` first (and sets `value`) then `submitform()` (and triggers `onsubmit()`).
i expect formik to be able to validate all `<field/>`s that have a `validate` prop.
my handlesubmit() to be called.
it should show the error messages
i am not sure what's behind this, but such extra rerender with the invalid state shouldn't be there for sure.
when internal requirements are met, only the "general" errormessage-meaning the error component for the array taken globally- should be displayed.
no crash, should just work.
note that while i was testing, it seems it was working fine with 1.2.0.
typescript v3.1.6 configured with the same settings doesn't raise an error.
clicked the "add my address" button a new property is added to testobj ( new value of myaddress: 222 place) the new property is displayed below "addresses" the form is not dirtied and remains invalid.
the submit button is not clickable.
at a high level: after the events above i expect the form to receive the expected errors (i.e.
`errors.email`) so that it triggers the rendering of my error msg.
(this works in browser) in unit tests: after i run a {target: ..etc}'); myfield.blur()` i should be able to test that error message has appeared and email value is displayed.
the definition of arrayhelpers.push accepts anything as a parameter to push into the array.
i should be able to add objects into it.
formik/yup will show validation errors inside out.
i can test formik snapshots
by default, i would expect formik to not interfere with the default behavior of `<input type="number />` and keep the value as a string.
the value automatically parsing the value doesn 't seem to be worth the confusion it causes by differing from default react behavior.
the answer to this issue phofhyperlink , where suggestion to achieve such behavior was build your own `numberinput` component, would be what i expect.
returning `{ fieldname: undefined }` from validation function should set `isvalid` to true
phofcode **42 loops** launch for (not) rendering
should fill correct error for field inside errors object like in case of blur
i would expect that `getin` method returns the fallback value `undefined` when the path is `undefined`
should update them when enablereinitialize is true.
it used to before in 0.11 version
- documentation has description of "propagate" argument
- second click on circlemarker close popup.
the number of tiles that started loading should be equal to the number of loaded tiles
i have 4 types of marker with different images.
i have some filter options which selects specific objects from a database and create a marker from it's lat-lng data.
i can choose, which layer be shown on the map.
returns the geographical bounds visible in the current map view ( phofurl )
use pasive addeventlistener { pasive : true }
the '+' in the zoom control or text in attribution control are not selected
leaflet to throttle requests to tiles.
i should see every markers i've drawn.
component unmount and no error is trigger
passing options to `l.geojson()` should pass those options to all child elements.
this is especially important for plugin authors that use inithooks on leaflet classes.
the markers on all maps should open.
the circle should always stay on top of any new tiles loaded during panning.
the layer controls button needs text or context.
success criterion 2.4.4 link purpose (in context): phofurl
recovered memory after gc using interactive:true mode
the map should be draggable
the wms layer should render as it does in chromium(77).
either no reaction (like on chrome or firefox for android) or normal zooming in the map.
tooltip open at the center of overlay just like rectangle, there should be a getcenter method.
tooltip should occur at the map, and keeping open when zoom in or zoom out.
the anchor of the tooltip should move relative to the `iconanchor` according to the values defined in the `tooltipanchor`.
it should have same behavior as `popupanchor` according to documentation, e.g.
if given same values it should position itself at same position as popup.
polygons should overlay base map
when the link has focus or hover it should show an underline or some other visual indicator to pass wcag compliance.
the logged `event.originalevent` should be of type `touchevent` as documented here phofhyperlink
tooltips, like overlays and rasters, should be culled when off screen for performance reasons
i expected leaflet to render normaly inside the "map" div.
clicks on the back button, should bring back to the previous positions of the map.
jump or zoom to the position.
the panto should always center the map by its container dimensions.
the click handler is triggered
expect the mouseover event of d3.js to work properly in leaflet
svg element will include the class `myclass`
as the user moves the mouse over the polygons, it smoothly highlights them (by changing fillopacity) without any lag.
this is the behavior in leaflet 1.4.
i expect no javascript error.
there is no error with leaflet 1.4.0.
developing some feature with custom shape, i want events bubble correctly.
it's obvious, that leaflet need more info about my shape, but having some documented way to provide such info for custom features would be definitely better than silent assumptions.
expected behavior: map shouldn't freeze.
when the map is not loaded in an iframe but directly in the browser, like here: phofurl the map won't freeze on a samsung galaxy
not setting the opacity when the icon is null.
map to be displayed fully
the default attribution link should link to https not http, or their should be at least an easy way to set it to https when creating a new map.
while the layer is visible, the tile load request should be made.
once we zoom past the the maxzoom, tile load should stop.
pinch zoom / touch events should work on other elements after pinch zooming on the leaflet map
callback that is passed is invoked.
i expected that using a layergroup (e.g.
of two tile layers with different zoom levels) as a basemap in control.layers works.
the marker icon should change from the default blue icon, to whatever you image you linked to it.
the opened popup should be closed then the <kdb>esc</kdb>-key is pressed
- each layers.control handle it base layers separately.
second click on marker just show popup
previous zoom level is retained (no dark gray flash): irregular-grid-fixed phofimage
the map click event should be firing.
the marker click event should be firing.
as long as the mouse is on the line, even when it is thicker, the mouseover event should stay active.
controls stay visible, as they do with other/earlier browsers
the screen reader should have some way of interacting with the map data.
there's no perfect way i know of to do this, but a few models come to mind.
* no tiles are loaded, because the map's zoom (5) is outside the `minzoom` .. `maxzoom` range (16 .. 18) * the performance is excellent, because there are no tiles to load at this zoom level.
a geojson polygon feature with less than 4 coordinates must raise error.
an alert should be displayed via the `mouseover` event handler.
radio buttons on other maps are not affected
the property map.tap has too be defined so that the map behave like any other mobile device, and by extension any plugin using map.tap to work correctly.
it would be nice if automatic security checking tools wouldn't find this issue because due to restriction in some environments, the library can't be used.
leaflet shouldn't keep exceeding the maximum call stack size.
probably should only reach a max zoom level to prevent the popup from leaving the bounds.
tilelayer redraw all tiles: image phofimage
the expected behavior is that the page produces no errors
expect to stop watch correctly
in the test, we have add transaction 0,1,2,4 to mempool.
when we try to get_block from mempool and exclude transaction 1, we should also implicitly exclude transaction 0 because transactions from the same account should be executed in the order of sequence number.
currently, it will return transaction 0 and 2 as the next proposal.
however, i am not quite sure whether we could run into situation where exculde 1 while not exclude 0. if it is possible, then i think should fix this behavior.
in the test, we first insert transaction 0,2,3,4 of account 0 to mempool.
0 goes to priority_index and 2,3,4 go to parking_lot_index.
then we insert transaction 1 to mempool.
because we set mempool size 4, transaction 4 will be remove from parking_lot_index and transaction 1 will go priority_index.
then, function would add 2,3 priority_index.
however, 2,3 are not removed from parking_lot_index.
this can result in a bad situation.
when trying add 0 of account 1 mempool, 3 of account 0 will be removed from mempool, which is actually a legitimate be included in the next block.
instead, i expect see a failure when adding of account 1.
there's no such thing as enough paranoia, so `cargo-audit` warnings should break the build.
libra swarm should start to run.
a test should have the exact same behavior in both cases.
reviewer is only assigned when draft pr is actually published
it should build and generate the config.
`./scripts/dev_setup.sh` should install all necessary binaries and tools necessary for the build.
this program should be rejected by the stack usage verifier with the status code at offset 0.
we initiate a state sync upon restart and the system got stuck.
from the log, the current guess is networking failed to setup connections.
we expect: - better error message, it's not very clear why the system is stuck.
- handle network startup gracefull
step 2 above should also show the same warning as step 5.
`success no vulnerable packages found`
throw a command error message
the slow peers fall behind, but the responsive peers should still commit blocks.
it should transfer the coins **please complete the following information:** - ubuntu 16.04.3 lts
i expected `transfer 0 1 10` to result in the following output phofcode or if the transaction failed i expect the balances to remain unchanged.
however sometimes the error is shown but when i query balances transfer was successful.
wanted to build the system successfully
after minting an account with x libra, querying the balance should display x libra.
expected readme instructions to work: phofurl
1) go is installed 2) on failure, the script tells you what has been installed and what has not, before exiting.
i was either expecting to have the account i created before still present and accessible, or if i recreate it to have a 0 balance.
i think the build scripts should be able to be executed from anywhere, especially from within their directories.
build failed but in principle should succeed
be able to do what i want with my money.
compilation and verification of transaction script.
loading a mnemonic key file should not require external calls to the validator.
hence there should be no error and the addresses should simply be generated.
spy, steal, sell your data, censor, and turn you into pig at the slaughter
juste wanted to build the system and connect to a node in testnet.
juste wanted to build the system and connect to a node in testnet.
dependencies should be installed without errors
only two-tilde wrapped texts should be strikethrough.
when i am writing a markdown containing tabs, i will expect it to give the same alignment when converted to html.
it how any user will expect.
i am using this text: <img width="470" alt="image" src=" phofurl the arrows aren 't aligned upon parsing.
it gets parsed to html like this: <img width="1440" alt="image" src=" phofurl <img width="525" alt="image" src=" phofurl while, any user will expect it to be like this: <img width="500" alt="image" src=" phofurl
phofcode in the current state, the link is invalid.
the character actually shows up in text.
according to wikipedia phofhyperlink : > the unicode characters u+2424 (symbol for newline, ), u+23ce (return symbol, ), u+240d (symbol for carriage return, ) and u+240a (symbol for line feed, ) are intended for presenting a user-visible character to the reader of the document, and are thus not recognized themselves as a newline.
the expected output is `<h1 id="h1">h1</h1>`
`&` in query section of an uri should not be escaped as it changes the semantics of the query params.
it should render the markdown content from api
we should not display nested list items as code: image phofimage this is the behavior we get in vs code: image phofimage
the `baseurl` should be added to the <img /> tag.
can work without a line break, and the same level of nesting should be a separate line, see the example below.
## one > 123 >>> 123 ## two > 123 >> 123 >>> ## three > >> >>> ## four > >> >>
totally screwy marked up text, but not exponential runtime.
the text should look like this: * [commonmark demo]( phofurl
expected output: `<p><em>&quot;i like turtles.&quot;</em></p>`
the heading should be rendered separately from the table
i expect html output to look like this: phofcode
like commonmark, i think marked should output the following html: phofcode
expected not to have the last `)` stripped from href.
the hole text should be italic
the `--test` cli option should be displayed in the man page, since it is a valid option in the marked binary phofhyperlink
well, i'm looking at the exact same example using remark - another popular parser, that i think was forked out of marked back then, and everything renders correctly.
let me know if i need to provider more information.
when `gfm` and `breaks` are enabled, the second example (soft line break) should not output a `<br />` tag.
phofcode should output <p>foo bar</p> ``
expected the url to be made html friendly with the switch `sanitize` by replacing spaces with `%20`.
however if in place of italic strikethrough is used, everything works as expected.
it should bold first and last 3 characters.
and then have italic from the second character to second last character.
no html inside input string should be rendered as html, when sanitize is true.
when there is whitespace in the info string, gfm appears to use the first word as the language and ignore the rest.
(as demonstrated here phofhyperlink ) i would expect marked to do same by default and pass entire info string to a custom renderer.
i would expect to have both lists, an unordered list and right after, an ordered list.
expect the following output <del><a
with the above code, only aaa should have &lt;p&gt; element wrappers.
expect to see the commonmark output.
it works if i modify slightly on marked 's umd code, from original phofcode to phofcode which is borrowed from umd template phofhyperlink
actually i don't know which version is right.
but github version seems better?
expected to have the same result as in commonmark parser
the pasted text should be the same as copied.
successful exporting to a file, with a prompt requesting save location, or at least an error.
just like what github shows: phofimage
file should render normally and be editable.
the search query input field should receive the focus.
the search query input field should be prefilled from the currently selected text, similarly how the local search is implemented.
the match should be found if the texts output looks as a whole, no matter if the source code contains markup.
dark mode should be used
jump to test2.md like ctrl+click
nice syntax highlighting of a string, e.g as on github: phofcode
just like typora, no error prompt.
open the link in a browser.
the list is rendered with check boxes for markers, as specified for github flavored markdown phofhyperlink .
here is a live example: 1.
[x] open the refrigerator 2.
[ ] put the elephant in 3.
[ ] close the refrigerator
the heading should be normalized when it's not an empty paragraph because headings in text is not allowed by markdown specification.

the folder is opened, and i can see the markdown file in the folder in side bar.
the typed words will be input the cell.
i would expect the image to be properly shown in the exported pdf/html file.
if the image can't be shown, i would expect the editor to show me an error or a warning about issue.
just delete the empty paragraph, and move the header up.
text should remain centered on the screen the same as when you use a fixed pixel amount for the editor width.
if the links are too long then it should wrap like regular text.
the second formula should not appear in the preview.
not able to edit the markdown content while a dialog is shown.
checkboxes shouldn't use 100% width but only the needed width.
cursor should jump to the first line.
- image transform should shown by first click image.
- press `space` should preview the selected image.
the #civil_war) bit should be included in the link, so that the rendered text only shows `own text` underlined.
when we parse a single `pre` tag as block like above, we should show it as code block.
i would expect the images to show up in the pdf

only editor menus should be updated and not all menus.
expected automatic text wrapping in the editor preview.
expected automatic text wrapping in the pdf export.
the output of .html and .pdf should both contain badges
it 's nice to either have the rendered equation in a pure background (like what 's now in block math, so we can actually see it) or shift the below text down (so the rendered equation stays in a whole new line).
at first arrow-left press the word `works` should be selected.
after that, each additional arrow-left press should select an additional word.
no exception and katex should not try to render this because it's not a math block nor inline math.
no html edit protection should be shown and the math preview and edit box is shown when clicking inside the box.
should not create header 3 in table cell.
all the headers with same level should be align with or without any sub header.
for example: phofimage the window close button are exactly closed to the right side of screen.
you should not see the scroll bar.
code block still can be input.
foo $a e b <cursor>
the closing bracket should be removed while the opening bracket remains
i would expect mark text to save the output file as: phofcode
if the cursor is invalid all new changes, until cursor is set again, should be discarded.
we could catch this in muya's `eventhandler`.
the existing tab should be selected/opened.
the cursor at the first place like this `<cursor>

i expected the file would be opened in the existing instance of marktext.
that `&lt;` is visible as a `<`
cursor moves to the next cell
multiple empty lines are inserted.
the application menu should be updated via window focus event.
in other words, window `a` should have `source code mode` ticked and window `b` not.
this also applies to every other `checkbox` and `radio` menu item.
line should wrap between words at spaces.
[what you expected to happen] when there is no selection, shift-left arrow must set the keyboard focus on the left end of the selection.
the shift-left and shift-right arrows should then shrink and grow the selection by moving left side.
the rationale is that shift arrows must not move caret.
in summary, shift arrows may update left or right end of selection.
by default it updates right end.
it must update left end, if **shift-left arrow** is typed and there is no selection (or empty).
[what you expected to happen] no newlines after the `created` line.

the "themed" button should ideally have a light red background in edge (css variables appear to be supported now)... or at least keep the white text from the sass configuration
similarly to native range sliders it's not expected that the right mouse button can be used to drag/change the slider value.

the component with ripple (in this case the button) after tapping should revert back to what it was before the tap.
clicking on check box in a table row results in no error.
the menu closes on scroll event like the native select.
no error should appear on first compilation
being able to build angular library
icons appear for all themes.

- the form field components ** should ** update their ui when the components value changes via `javascript` or `ajax`.
- the form field components ** should ** update their ui when the components value is reset via `form.reset()` or `<button type="reset">`.
the label color of the disabled selection control should change to the disabled state
the top-app-bar should restore to its original size for the short variant whenever the page is scrolled back to the top noticed this while upgrading rmwc to 3.0.0. i don 't believe this was an issue with 2.0.

helper text should not be displayed in this conditions
asterisk needs to be in grey color similar to floating label color when input is disabled.
the class `mdc-chip-set--input` should allow the chips to be edited

the mdc-select component shouldn't affect other components
the checkbox container color should be scoped to component instance when is used.
: the screenshot test should... 1. detect that a build is already running in another process 2. skip building js/css assets
the label should be floating after losing focus
for metabase questions and pulses to work past 4 days of uptime
upgrades should not break existing charts.
view the result of the query
it should say that i'm running the latest version
null or "is empty" filters are retained on the "view these xxx" function.
consistent behavior between "view these xxx" from the dashboard and the base question.
to use case insensitive sorting: phofcode
subsequent processing steps should be retained when editing earlier steps.
i understand that there could be dependencies between these steps but often that 's not the case.
i expected to be able to add a new filter and not lose most of my work.
notebooks should enable exploratory analysis, and allow you to build up a complex series of operations.
resetting these steps prevents that.
date fields should display as `december 1, 2019`
return to viz selection, like all other viz types.
when querying using custom question with joining one or two tables, unable to save the result as a question, however when queries has no joins even on heavy aggregation, iam able to save the question with no issue.
it should open metabase setup page correctly.
you're able to select a question in a reasonable amount of time
the release page said hash should be
download button should remain visible if there was no change in the query.
expected metabase to be able to show existing collections once the database was added.
for the given example the difference with the charts should be of 1/8, not almost the same.
should be able to save or replace the question.
saved questions that use tables linked via fks should be able to access the linked tables
the query should not switch to edit mode and stay to the url
result grouped by whichever column mentioned before filtered by count greater than 2
should be able to layer both the charts on a single graph as per phofurl
would simply expect the x axis and grouping variables to remain as the filter is added
the way stupid-me understands the ui is that the sid is required, whereas the tns is optional.
however, after _a lot_ of trial and error, documentation and logs parsing, i 've found that the (magic) working configuration is setting `container` as _"oracle service name"_, and leaving _"sid"_ empty: <img src=" phofurl width=350 /> i guess it makes sense, because these are same details used for connecting via `sqlplus` but itried quite some time by using `container` as "sid" (because i understood this entry as required) what obviously didn 't worked.
all pins should in the map should be visible from the start unless a specific zoom or pan is set as default.
i expect the zoom level to account for the height of pin so it can be displayed.
i expect the zoom level to be retained when i hover a pin to get more info
zoom in to that grid section, grouped at a smaller lat/lon.
this works as expected when the same data is collected using a simple query builder as shown below after the "zoom in": image phofimage
you can unselect without the issues
a dump file should be written and data which seems to be fine in postgresql should not result in integrity violations.
joins should be allowed for saved questions
in the tooltip, all of of the selected countries should be shown example: if us, gb, and de are selected in the filter, the tooltip should show: "country: us, gb, de"
as the user is removed from the mapped group it should be assigned to the "default" group.
being able to edit the dashboard that contains these 2 questions.
i expect it to save.
maybe the saved questions shouldn't be listed at all, since those data can't be queried in a native query.
the java `user.timezone` to be respected when grouping.
to properly load, place and resize new question cards to dashboards.
i 'd expect the date granularity to change
probably would prefer things to be like the other custom queries where just the "example database" name would be shown.
the x-axis should reflect the ordering changes in the filter configuration.
the (long) question names should be truncated (or wrapped into multiple lines) therefore the vertical scrolling would be applied to the right grey column only and no horizontal scrollbar would be visible.
the questions should not have static information on the schema name saved but query the database connection for the current schema name.
this not to happen :)
the downloaded data should contain data from both questions, each in its own column.
expect metabase to error and say, "database with name 'foo ' already exists"
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
we will see two lines.
however for each date is visualized only one "point"
i expected to be able to create custom columns using both the fields available in in the query and available functions as per before this update.
i also expect the custom columns to not be removed when i make other changes to the report
query builder will show up
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
ability to do filtering via dashboard.
the 'save new question ' dialog should appear
a sql generated must not include table alias as a prefix
ideally one of the following should happen after clicking on one of the download formats 1. disable the download menu and show a loading icon instead 2. close the menu altogether and show loading for entire dashboard
all questions should show results.
migrate the data from h2 to mysql
when hovering over any data point on the dashboard, the tool-tip should appear and display the date and the measure value.
in example below we use date function (that returns a date) instead of date_format (that returns a string).
then tool-tip shows up properly: bildschirmfoto um 11 06 10 phofimage
i expected to be able to add other databases
it should show one bar for each `project_id`, similar to this: image phofimage
just to join by the selected columns without any casting/parsing.
the permissions grid should always accurately display granted permissions.
the error message should be displayed
either clearly explain that metabot can 't have data permissions, or remove metabot from this screen entirely.
pie slice should show 1
i guess it should be something like: phofcode
running queries and saving entities should not cause errors.
the charts should be displayed (as they also work in microsoft 's edge browser).
it should display line graph with no errors.
to download the entire data since it is in the limit of 1 million rows
i would expect to see those orders using the same query previously used
dates returned as dates so that they can be graphed.
map should be rendered on the print preview just like on the dashboard.
time series is recognized, data is ordered on x with proper
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
receive a pulse email every day 08:00
bar charts are rendered without the series which is null.
clicking update would return a little confirmation message, just like changing password does.
the dashboard should load correctly.
values set as percentage should show in percentage format.
it should show the chart and not an error :)
if i add or edit a filter to a dashboard all questions ask for the parameter to filter.
the two dates should match
members should remain members of a metabase group as long as they are still members in the ldap group.
i expected to see the symbol r when i select currency.
i expected the pulse image after the upgrade to look like it used to before the upgrade.
i don't think the image should nearly double in size between a release candidate and the release.
also, running a very large image can cause issues when running the service in a cluster where the image may not be cached on local machine, as added size requires more time to download.
since the initial table tells me there are 2 records at the 4 pm time slot, i would expect to be able to see 2 records
the collection of the question has moved
the map should be filter for gps coordinates
should behave like the filter sidebar, which uses the aliased table name.
raw data in table format is returned (in both scenarios)
the list of field from jointable should be included in the list for user to select in the custom expression.
i am expecting all basic metrics to be available on all tables, regardless of when they are created.
the expected behavior is to finish the mysql migrations without getting stuck and set up the mysql tables on amazon aurora.
(metabase v0.31.2 does this without issues)
would include all data through the last day of the prior month.
the y range adheres to the manually set values
i 'd expect that whatever formats i choose for the columns in the table would also apply to exported versions of that table.
i would expect the search to be able to find tables based on how they are referenced in the rest of metabase, i.e.
i should be able to use a dashboard i have collections access to even if i have no self-service data access permissions
the documentation for v0.33.0 to load
i expected to see charts
an error message with more details.
i think conveying the error message that postgres returns would have been more useful than "server error encountered".
i get that we 're trying to improve error message handling overall, though :)
a couple possibilities: * show asterisks by all required fields * display validation messages for all fields after blurring them (for example, show a message if password and password confirmation after blurring password confirmation)
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when i press key, i want it appears in the textbox like any other letter.
for it to display the value.
i actually have successfully tried the migration on my local machine (windows), with the same h2 db files with raw database created via pgadmin and it migration ran fine (there was however some missing data after i reran the instance that stems from the migration)
to be able to save the custom column
i would expect not to see these fields in tab config
the filter should be properly applied returning only groups with count more than 1
i 'd expect the list to either render downward and/or at least allow me to scroll to see offscreen choices.
variable side panel loads for `date_part` (image from older metabase version, i confirmed this works in the 32.9 docker image) image phofimage
both platform and application code should be populated with the proper configuration.
it shall be possible to bin the results so grid map can be used - even better if it would work for native sql as well
the world map should render in a reasonable amount of time(<5 seconds imho) and should not freeze the whole ui
expected result - something inline with the below: phofimage
i 'd like to be able to use my counter field in custom expressions.
i expected it to continue to accept our valid internal fqdn for a server.
i think it 's probably doing some lookup on what are valid * internet * tld values, but as we can and are encouraged to self host metabase i think we should be able to use any valid host name.
one result per matching question
just fresh the ui without clicking a button :smiley:
the _link text_ value should reset as soon as the ajax request to reset the value completes.
slack should be showing the populated chart coming from metabase
it should write a complete json object
the filter should show like it does prior to the save: monosnap phofimage
first of all, i think the whole syncing should not terminate, if one table fails to sync it should still be tried for the other tables.
in addition to that metabase should be able to also scan tables with spatial data.
all rows should be exported.
it should return a password sucessfully changed message or something
when john opens dashboard or particular question, he see result and can use filtering so as he have access to collection
whatever underlying process it is indicating is loading should finish and the spinning indicator should dissappear.
i would expect to see my five collections.
checkbox for current period remains checked until unchecked by the user.
the map should work with the filter, but it break all other question and none of them apply select filter.
reorder fields and place them anywhere we want without ever causing the fields to disappear.
new users should be able to log into the application correctly.
the expectation is that these tables can be joined to see columns from both tables under the circumstances that `foo` is distinct and non-empty.
results of the successful query should display.
a pop up with the new password should appear.
dashboard should consistently show all the questions properly
should not be replaced by the filter but directly provided to presto.
"include today" checkbox remains checked upon save
the full length of the left div/pane should be white.
expected behavior would be for there to be an input field where you can specify _which goal_ you are looking for.
or else instead of having one single `goal xx completions` metric to have one for each configured goal (bonus if metabase pulled in the goal's name for convenience, but number would be better than nothing).
see the terminal in fullscreen.
this works just as expected on the primary monitor.
it should show up prompt after hitting `ctrl-c` many times.
was hoping the application would open..
other panes should take up the blank space of the window after i close some panes.
the title of the tab should be `vs2017 developer cmd`.
the terminal should enter in full screen mode
the batch file will be executed.
expected behavior is for the terminal to not affect the system and work just like any other window
should be ctrl+comma displayed, iirc.
cursor should following the characters, like in cmd.exe: cmd_ime_cursor_follow phofimage
terminal will start powershell with privileged rights, that means powershell will run under a privileged context, which can be used to managed other computer in a domain.
nothing, because the index is out of range.
set palette index 15 and 16 to the given color.
output a "" (i delete the extra "" in the following picture manually) image phofimage
expected terminal to install, and potentially resolve dependencies
text is painted and can be copied
windows terminal warns you that powershell cannot be found, or perhaps launches a fallback `cmd` session instead.
i encountered this issue because some unruly installer erased my `path`
copied function should be pasted with the same behavior as `ctrl+v`.
pasted code should not be interpreted until the `enter` key is pressed, with the same formatting as the source it was copied from.
terminal being drawn correctly: image phofimage
the alternate screen buffer doesn 't have a scrollback, so the `ed3` sequence should erase the main scrollback buffer.
then when you switch back to the main screen, there should be no scrollback any more.
this is how the command is implemented in xterm, and most of other terminal emulators i 've tested.
the `ris` command should automatically switch back to the main buffer, and then clear the main buffer 's screen.
the final 1049 sequence isn 't relevent at that point, since we are already back in the main buffer.
the end result should be a blank screen, other than the shell prompt.
i don 't think this behavior is actually documented anywhere, but that 's way it works in xterm, and most of other terminal emulators i 've tested.
the code format(layout) is the same as the originate file.
i can see which tab is active clearly.
i'd expect the history window to popup showing the `ver` command i'd just entered.
if i scroll up, i should be able to see the serial console messages from my embedded target.
- (window scales down correctly) - window should stay on second monitor
an slow by line scrolling like on conhost.exe
windows opened by these powershell commands will get focus and be open over windows terminal.
i should be able to see the tab while dragging
i would expect that all of the tabs are visible next to each other, since there is enough room to display them.
context menu should be legible with white text on dark background.
the overlay resizes with the window size and the about box itself stays centered
* current tab closes * tab bar disappears * other tab is usable.
it is a small bug... i hope it can be fixed in next version... thx
cursor is visible no matter what background color is.
the external tool appears in the foreground.
background should be blue with no black lines screenshot (29) phofimage
i would expect the title bar to use the same color/theme as the other apps in the system.
the title bar is sized correctly.
the terminal stays open and might change the size and the resolution depending on the monitor
raising the terminal window should focus the text area no matter how you do it.
works as expected if you click any other tab than the currently active.
resizing the terminal window should change the reported terminal dimensions.
terminal resize behavior should be unaffected by historysize.
it would be nice to have the same key code for arrow keys so that tui applications can work in windows terminal, if not, then is there documentation for the keycodes for each key and their differences with those found in cmd or powershell?
every phofcode should delete one char
the equals sign renders normally, as it does on non-pwsh windows.
the same input in the powershell tab works normally: image phofimage additional notes: changing the font settings appeared to have no effect.
for reference, here is the entry for powershell core in my settings.json: phofcode
rendering works the same as on the main screen buffer.
selected text should invert the text colors:
this same profile had been used to launch an anaconda powershell prompt and until terminal had been working properly.
i would expect all of the initial state to be inherited by the alt buffer, producing the following results: - the "start" text should be on line 9, column 20, i.e.
the position before switch to alt buffer.
- the "margin" text should be on line 15, bottom margin.
- the "tab" text should be in column 20, position of tab stop that was set.
- the cursor should invisible.
here 's what output looks like in xterm: image phofimage
i'm used to having a few failures in the and i know a couple of `tabtests` are blocked, but the rest of the tests i would usually expected to pass.
app launches as the user i specify
i expect that the password text would be pasted and accepted by `git` command
the terminal window should be completely contained within the left half of the right display.
the windows terminal window should move to the other screen.
the tabs disappear when the window becomes to small to display them.
then slide back out when the window is resized to fit them again.
similarly to what happens with the regular french keyboard, the combination on an azerty-nf keyboard layout is a dead-key and should not produce any output to the terminal.
followed by a supported character, for instance <kbd>o</kbd>, this dead-key sequence corresponds to the `~` diacritical mark and should type character `` by itself on terminal.
fast and responsive (like it performs in non-full screen mode).
the line with `pt list --upgradable` should display with the correct text size, as in windows console: image phofimage i'm using the simplified chinese language edition of windows, and windows console uses simsun, 12pt as default font.
can launch new profile in new tab
same amount of lines as in the source and the paste not affecting existing text in unexpected ways.
i expect that immediately, or after a few seconds at most, the ctrl+c command interupts the command and scrolling output from the find command in the terminal.
the acrylic effect to stay whether or not terminal is in focus.
1 outputs of these two `seq`s shouldn 't interleave
see the numbers from 1 to 100
the schema found here: phofurl says that the default background is
the blackground is suposed to be black (grayish blue) on asni 40.
------------------ i assume that this is the result of my incompetence rather that an actual bug, but in this case the documentation should be updated.
* scrolling and other mouse events should be passed through and handled by the respective program * double clicking should engage visual mode in vim
returned hresult should indicate failure since a pty cannot have a negative size
* expect application to start repeatably
i expect the image to not be stretched and positioned to the bottom right.
should show modestly colored output: image phofimage
the terminal properties should be set to their factory defaults.
all properties of the terminal should be the same as before step 2. that is to say restoring the 'use legacy console' property in step 5 should restore the state of terminal to what it was before property was changed.
the pasted function works as expected.
simple - terminal should not be freezing when it's minimised
to be able to have more then 5 profiles (like shown in the windows store screenshot) image phofimage
chunk selection continues to happen just fine.
a auto completion menu is displayed ** once ** and i can select with my keyboard.
terminal not to crash when moved to a second display.
i 've tried to activate the bash into windows.
i followed some instructions to activate the windows feature "windows subsystem for linux" ( phofurl after that, when i tried to run bash, my terminal window quickly opened and just after closed, without ask me nothing.
loading indicator is shown, in few seconds terminal is closed
entering a "clear" or "clear-host" command in powershell should clear the terminal window, including clearing the scrollback buffer of all output.
this is the functionality of the cmdlet if running from a cmd window, powershell app, and ps ise.
1. run app from vs (i.e.
ctrl+f5) empty console window vs console window properties - layout: * windows size: width 100 cols and height 26 rows * screen buffer size: width 100 cols and height 26 rows 2. run app from command prompt (i.e.
run cmd) empty console window command prompt console window properties - layout: * windows size: width 100 cols and height 26 rows * screen buffer size: width 100 cols and height 26 rows
a relatively idle terminal should not be consuming 100% gpu and there by freezing the ui
cloud shell shows up as a profile.
the full path should be dropped into the command line at the cursor location, as it does in windows command prompt.
terminal should continue working on other screen.
before i updated the os, the title bar used to be black under this theme.
the same dialog box appears indicating the error and i can dismiss the dialog and continue using the cmd tab.
windows terminal respects my remapped key, i.e., caps lock + shift + <num> launches a new tab.
a shell logged into my azure portal.
pasting of highlighted text triggered by `copyonselect`
contents of the files are displayed, no hang / crash.
tab closes (if last tab, terminal closes)
you should not be seeing extra newlines when you copy text
you are able to scroll to the current input location
auto completion should not redraw the cursor
terminal is dragged onto another monitor
no white line at the bottom of the window
the executable files and the folders ' names are displayed in bold.
(you can check the bold character in mintty with the option `show bold ad font`.)
the appearance of the terminal should be completely normal with the acrylic background.
when i open the `profile.json` in vscode and i want to set a color, it may be better if the color can be edited with the vscode colorpcker.
it 's can be obtained by set `format: color` in the json scheme, but i don 't know how to disable alpha and only support `"
expected to see the distro logos for ubuntu, debian, opensuse, and kali in the menu and on each tab.
an example can be found at this article from the microsoft dev blog this article from the microsoft dev blog phofhyperlink .
give me a way to allow the terminal to launch from a current directory.
i'm ok if that means having to set my default profile to `%cd%`.
a low level output prior to latest updates was projecting the same symbol buffer at actions per second.
timings were 25ms at max.
i 'm making a console game engine and those timings are crucial.
if there is any better function which passes the console output buffer (char_info*) please tell me.
closing the instance of terminal
the window shouldn 't stand out.
i expect that neovim view adapt with the new window size
see a working terminal with all the past text output
you are able to carry on typing
the font setting being applied: grafik phofimage grafik phofimage
the windows terminal should execute 32-bit executables without throwing any error
be interpreted as a single command.
1. run the same node test.js on native cmd or powershell and resize the window => everything is ok (the number of row and column is updated)
vs changes debug to release and proceeds
should be able to select a tenant number greater than tenant 9, e.g.
i 'd expect both x64 and x86 powershell 5.1 to appear in gui.
when the wpf control has to resize the buffer due to font changes or manual resize events the connection should get a corresponding message.
not sure how impactful this really is but my expectation would be that the user would be unable to effect the current location text since they are unable to edit it as normal text
render the line like this: image phofimage render the line like this (this is the vscode terminal with the same font selected)
the window should simply disappear.
the new tabs should be visible
(as on windows 7) the program quickly exits (edit: after hitting enter!)
and returns the user to the command prompt.
during the maximize animation (step 5) the acrylic windows should render in real-time, as it does when moving (step 3) or resizing (step 4) the terminal window.
the powershell tab should trigger the powershell.exiting event and a file `%temp% general kenobi.txt` should be created.
you should see details about the window in the right hand pane.
customer application should load, presenting user with splash screen.
from here, user can navigate linux based application.
note that this doesn 't happen with in phofimage phofimage version
entire terminal with default profile on screen in its entirety is expected to be seen on desktop
this should copy the selection into clipboard just as usual with legacy cmd / powershell terminal
if these attributes include a background color too, behavior is messy across a linewrap, due to terribly designed bce (background color earse) phofhyperlink feature.
(now, vte, and perhaps some other emulators too, intentionally implement bce differently, as another means of mitigating problem i 'm describing here, but let 's leave that to another day.)
as a workaround for background color problem, several utilities decide to also emit an el after restoring background color, earse faulty color there.
and they often don 't realize that this introduces an even more serious issue: at linewrap, character might get dropped from output.
an example is grep phofhyperlink with its default settings.
putty 0.73 's changelog refers gcc.
notes we (vte) haven 't received any bugreport about it, nor did i saw one in kitty 's, konsole 's or iterm2 's bugtracker.
also there 's no vttest test case for this.
i do recommend you follow our behavior here.
steps 4 and 5 respond quickly.
when in vt mode, a `tab` character should not move the cursor position past the end of the line, so the `b` should be output on same line as `a`, in last column.
here 's what above test case looks like in xterm: image phofimage
option 1: hide the cursor.
option 2: display the partial cursor, and display the corresponding line of the terminal buffer too in this partial row.
also, make sure cursor keeps blinking as desired.
1 and 2: it changes the current directory to d:
the titlebar is black, like in the current stable windows.
tabs should not be invisible.
terminal continues to function normally.
pasted line appears text, below scrolls down
consistent output (which, by the way, reasonably closely matches what 's described in the file), regardless of timing, including with various parameters to slowcat phofhyperlink .
windows terminal should render symbols and fonts correctly
it 's expected that the build will continue in the background even after the rdp session is disconnected.
comments are encoded in json in a valid way like: phofcode
cannot scroll up, `clear-host` cleared the terminal, all previous output is gone.
there should be normal display lines without the shifting of a section of the entry/cursor line down by one line; it should display correctly, like with prior builds.
the cursor should stay where it is, nothing should be autocompleted.
further keystrokes should continue from this location,
- when not running something like byobu perhaps the letters abcd should be printed out phofhyperlink .
- when using byobu to manage console sessions it should switch between tabs.
the cursor should become invisible.
the same thing should happen all the time as you repeat this command (except at the first time when you begin on the normal screen), without the spurious random `1` and `h` described below.
font used for startup does not matter.
as if the delay wasn 't there, this should attempt to enable dec private mode 1234, which is unsupported by wt (actually undefined), so no action should be taken.
two linefeeds eventually, nothing more.
osc 10 sets the default foreground, it 's not yet supported by wt.
you can replace it with any other number that 's not yet supported.
the terminating sequence of `osc` should be `st` accoding to the standard (`bel` is a commonly used but nonstandard choice instead).
`st` in the `c0` set is `esc` followed by ` `.
now we insert a bit of delay in the middle of `st`.
such difference in timing should never make a difference in final outcome, not even when sequence is unsupported.
it should display powershell existing key binding basic editing functions phofcode
the entire line should be underlined.
windows terminal should be comparably fast to most graphical terminals on *nix.
since i don 't know the reason for the slowness (which needs to be investigated first), and i don 't know whether it 's specific to vmware, these are random guesses only and might completely miss the actual problem: the terminal should read and parse as much data as possible, only stopping for updating its ui according to the monitor refresh rate, typically 60 times per second (or maybe at a hardwired 60hz if refresh rate can 't be detrmined or concept doesn 't exist c i don 't know how it goes in vmware).
if updating ui takes so much time that there 's hardly any time left for processing incoming data, it should start dropping frames ( vte counterpart, kind of phofhyperlink ).
in iconified state or when another tab is selected, it shouldn 't spend any time on drawing.
--- note that i 've checked other bugreports about slowness, e.g.
for this issue we expect to accomplish the space of single tab layout by multiple tabs.
**example 1:** microsoft edge browser for multiple opened tabs microsoft edge browser provides 'scroll tab list forward' and 'scroll tab list backward' options to scroll over all the tabs and indicates the presence of multiple tabs.
terminal3 phofimage **example 2:** google chrome browser for multiple opened tabs google chrome browser squeeze all the opened tabs in single tab layout.
should not show a white border on the bottom of the window.
the custom theme should be used
1. select text 2. remove selection 3. clipboard remains unchanged
the list of profiles in the drop down should match the profiles.json
terminal should work while accessing it through rdp session
i can select, copy and paste text with these shortcuts just like in the old console
the box should have perfectly joined lines on all sides.
living in a monospaced environment where the box drawing characters are used to draw trees, boxes and other stuf perfect line joining is expected
"hello" is printed in bold (or at least a darker version of the foreground color)
the square brackets should appear....
some expected output shown from gpg in colors?
tabs continue to change and apply focus.
a new terminal tab to be opened with the appropriate profile: image phofimage
inspect.exe is able to recognize accessibility attributes in the top bar, and winappdriver is able to automate against them.
error message of the likes of "the term d is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program."
the background of powershell profile should change, as you select different `colorshemes` in the profile.json
image phofimage the most weird thing is that when taking a screenshot with the windows tool, everything appears normal on the screenshot like above.
i should not get a schema warning.
i should not get a schema warning about using `null` for `background`.
terminal should recognize phofcode as a line break and should execute the whole code as it does on powershell or wsl console directly.
the window should scale correctly when zoomed.
here is an example of what it should look like from fluent terminal image phofimage
windows terminal should work normally and get input.
both profiles should look the same
quoting from the dec std 070 manual: > if the active position is at or below the top margin when the cuu control is executed, and an attempt is made to move active position above top margin, control will be executed until active position reaches top margin.
the active position will not move beyond top margin.
similarly for `cud` command: > if is at or above bottom margin when cud control executed, and an attempt made to move below bottom margin, control will be executed until reaches bottom margin.
the position will not move beyond bottom margin.
so i would expect `cuu` sequence to stop on line 6, top margin, and `cub` sequence to stop on line 19, bottom margin.
this what output looks like in xterm: image phofimage
i can 't find spec text to back this up, but in both xterm and the gnome vte terminal these commands are constrained by the `decstbm` margins, so `cnl` doesn 't move below row 19 (the bottom margin), and `cpl` doesn 't move above row 6 (the top margin).
this is what the output looks like in xterm: image phofimage
we should be able to write spaces in the ipython prompt
arrows in the powerline font rendered in full size, aligned with the center of the line.
npm installs packages and the terminal remains usable.
`lines` value equals `initialrows` value defined in profile config.
two-finger scroll gesture on the touchpad should work as expected just like in legacy powershell and cmd terminals
all shells default to effectively "useacrylic": false`.
i would expect the zone to light up and the terminal to snap to the zone as every other app that i 've tried does.
i expect that the process will spawn a jupyter server as a background task and chrome will render the output on the windows side.
as the prompt is released to `fg`, i should be able to type whatever i want into prompt and background task is kept alive.
** note: ** this works as expected when using ubuntu standalone app (outside of windows terminal)
should be using cascadia code as per the release notes.
tab is closed, child process is killed.
tab is closed, child process is killed.
the terminal emulator should receive "a tb " (or " a tb " respectively).
clean display of command output without character smear; all characters removed when screen cleared.
terminal should launch, and at least show an error message.
right click should copy text.
character should be erased from screen
wt will generate/add a guid to the new custom profile, that way it can be set as the `defaultprofile`.
this was the case in previous versions of wt, before separation of cascading settings was implemented.
a somewhat similar copy of the prompt gets pasted in powerpoint.
(the strange looking blue part at the top is just the line right above the prompt that was just another prompt but shifted a little bit) image phofimage
"less" should start displaying the next file.
: nul-byte sent to pty slave)
general text should be colored in generic colors such as `foreground` or explicit colors like `brightwhite` should change their color.
run wsl.exe with powerline font in windows terminal.
get a stack trace, and the terminal doesn 't actually close and crash back to desktop.
by the convention, the window should be maximized.
execution of the shell command on both native linux bash and cygwin bash when run through mintty.exe (cygwin tty host executable) prints hi in bright red, the expected behavior.
1. the left space or character on the left of command do not delete
ctrl+c should be readable from the and `$host.ui.rawui.readkey` functions
a new tab is created
the terminal should redraw itself to occupy all the available space.
1. current tab is ** always ** shown when on that tab.
1. tab bar can scroll left or right to make the current tab show in the tab bar.
1. current tab shows as much of title bar from left to right as possible, still allowing other tabs to have enough space to be clickable.
1. cycling through tabs does not show hidden tabs even when landing on one of the hidden tabs.
would really like have the ** option ** as in vs code not have and `x` close, but instead * right-click * `close` menus item.
this will be important as you apply making items smaller that are not current tab-item, it will be easy click close box by accident.
or, you can make close box `x` only visible for currently highlighted tab, but this seems overly complicated.
if there are too many items in list, last item should be `...`, and clicking it should list all tabs in order.
tabs should able moved a different position list.
hovering over a that has been shortened due screen real estate should show a popup indicating full title.
(bonus points for showing other information about (date it was opened, how long session has been opened, what type of prompt it is such powershell, cmd, linux, etc.)
in the event that you install the new terminal first before you install wsl, that terminal would pick up on the next launch that there has been a new distribution installed and that it needs to add a basic profile into the settings json.
my cursor to return to vintage
a proper working msys2 shell like in vs-code along with msys2.exe
correct string will be pasted to prompt and programs should continue as expected.
relatively controllable scrolling, comparable to other terminals like cmd.exe or powershell.
(both scroll completely fine on my setup)
uses existing settings, no error box.
version is reported as at least 0.4 since that is was is referenced in phofurl
at this point the build directory should be able to be deleted.
build dirs should not be used
there should not be any gaps between the characters.
here 's the terminal on a resolution monitor (landscape) at 100% scale setting image phofimage
the terminal continually runs ripgrep against all files on the drive.
i am expecting to have docker start up and run in the terminal.
m-> moves to the end of the file.
m-< moves to the beginning of the file.
c-h k m-> displays m-> as command run.
c-h k m-< displays m-< as command run.
i have the following configs on my `profile.json` file (just a fragment of the file): json { "acrylicopacity": 0.85, "closeonexit": true, "colorscheme" : "solarized dark", "commandline": "wsl.exe -d ubuntu-18.04", "cursorcolor": "
as seen in the attached picture on the right side we have the normal windows console (developer debug console) and on the left side we have windows terminal the expected output is what is shown in windows console.
it starts highlighting the row you are on (the text).
this is similar to putty, cmd, and powershell outside of terminal.
the terminal is scrolled when dragging the scrollbar
ctrl+c should continue to work for copying text out of windows powershell.
this is the behavior when using wsl via vanilla command prompt, or using gnome terminal on a standalone linux distro.
all the lines at the beginning should be kept and scrollback/scroll bar should appear
copyonselect adds the selected text to clipboard, and terminal continues to operate as intended
text is copied to the clipboard as both plain text and valid html.
windows terminal should stay open until it is closed like any other program.
when hovering, the mouse pointer position should be relayed to wsl and in return to the blessed application.
when clicking, the mouse pointer event should be relayed to wsl and in return to the blessed application.
: the behavior should be the same, whether or not the line wraps.
and i think the current behavior in the non-wrapping case seems correct.
console should be cleared, as when using any standard linux terminal
no overflow on surrounding monitors
the up arrow should retrieve older commands in the history.
- the cursor moves with the left-arrow keystrokes to the beginning of the line - new text appears line start
there should ideally be no delay in loading the background images.
the fancyzone function in powertoys should react and resize&put the window to where i want it to be, just like other windows like explorer.exe and firefox.exe.
expecting a copy of windows terminal to load.
expected behavior is to have the selected text copied to the clipboard.
correct output, lines containing the alphabet, with a number at the end of the line.
i 'd expect the to behave exactly as specified in the documentation phofhyperlink .
so the viewport content should be moved down by 4 lines, but only altering the area within _cliprect_.
i wouldn 't expect decstbm margins to have any affect on this operation.
essentially output should look like this: image phofimage
the line feeds should not cause the viewport to scroll when below the bottom margin, so the "bottom line?"
text should remain on the last line of screen.
this is what above test case looks like in xterm: image phofimage and here 's an extract from dec std 070 documentation for lf control, explaining that behavior: > if active position is below bottom margin when this control is executed (as result of absolute cursor positioning) it will still move downward by one line and no scrolling will occur.
in this case, active position will not move beyond bottom line of display.
tab title should be the profile name
terminal should open / tab should open / close.
colors look as nice as conemu 's
expected to open normally as usual.
this should clear any existing selection but not create a new one.
this is consistent with other windows programs which only show a selection when the cursor is dragged.
- the buffersize setted with `initialrows` gets updated after window size changes.
i expect the app to build, deploy, and be able to run
terminal uses a default font and does not crash

far manager opens file explorer in the selected directory
- cursor follows entered text - cursor moves when "left" or "right" button pressed - just like it is after fresh start
i expect chocolatey to install the latest version of terminal
the application installed from the store should launch just like the ones built on my machine.
according to the vt510 reference phofhyperlink , this should erase the lines "with all visual character attributes cleared".
the dec std 070 manual says the same sort of thing: "the empty character (imaged as space), the empty rendition, and empty character attribute."
rendition refers to attributes like underline, reverse video, etc.
so when clearing screen, i would expect underline and reverse attributes not to be applied, so it should just fill screen with red background color (dec 's vt terminals never had color, but that 's a requirement of [background color erase]( phofurl
rectangles should properly surround text inside the text buffer.
in the first case i 'd expect to see the first line indented by 5 characters.
in the second case i 'd expect to see 5 characters deleted from the first line.
this is how those commands look in xterm: image phofimage
the screen resize should have no effect on the active sgr attributes, so in each case i 'd expect to see two matching lines of text with identical colors.
display the wsl distro in the profiles list or add easy way to add it
the il escape sequence should force the cursor to move back to column 1, so the text should appear at the left margin.
this is what is looks in xterm: image phofimage for further confirmation that this is the correct behavior, this is what dec std 070 reference manual says regarding in _insert line_ escape sequence: > the active position set to left margin in active line after execution of this control.
the active line does not change.
terminal successfully opens/runs or else store does not allow the install
ctrl+w should put nano in search more
you should be able to use the arrow keys to move around.
you should be able to use the arrow keys to move around.
this does work in just powershell, but not in the new terminal

worth discussing, but i'm guessing it would simply reject the command and perform a system beep (or some other indication of the failure)
launching programs inside the terminal should not impact how/when newlines are preserved.
the tab should close with no problems.
we should be able to programmatically overwrite the customized `tabtitle` set in the profiles.json file - programmatically setting the tab title does work when no custom `tabtitle` is specified in profiles.json.
i believe the order of precedence should be, from lowest to highest: 1. default title / executable path 2. gets overwritten by `tabtitle` property in profiles.json 3. gets overwritten by scripts or programs setting their own titles
after scrolling the created tabs should be visible
my shortcuts which i have defined in phofurl should be kept
terminal window should open maxmimized in the upper-left of the screen appearing full-screen for immediate use the same way it would as if you hit the maximize button on terminal window or pressed windows key + up-arrow.
the expected is that the terminal be more response and when a key is released it is registered soon

i 've been able to build terminal successfully for weeks prior to azureconnection.
* the ** x ** to close the second tab would be visible, after the truncated window title, and before the new tab ** + ** button, to allow the tab to be closed.
i expect the screen and scrollback buffer to be completely cleared.
properly copied lines within the text editor.
i expect the newer version of to not cause the app to crash on startup i start the app with newest code and app crashes.
but when i restore the file of to pre version, everything works fine.
as noted in the screenshots above, when the window scrolls, it should use the current background color instead of reverting to the default.

a colorful steam locomotive runs over the screen and my productivity increases by 0.2 %.
the program 's name should show up correctly in the uac prompt.
per windows behavior, ctrl c should copy the text.

pasted text with new line characters like git output
background image renders for any valid ntfs path or uri tab title renders without encoding issues
i was hoping to print out special letters very often needed in the terminal.
i expect it to close with no errors
cursor position should continue to advance down the console as commands are entered and output is produced by cmdlets.
output fills all lines of the terminal (such as in cmd)

chinese characters should stay the same size no matter i type something above or beneath it
the lines under the line which the cursor resides in should scroll down one, and the bottom line of the screen should scroll out, and part of line with cursor following cursor should go to beginning of line vacated by scrolling down of subsequent lines and cursor should move to beginning vacated line.
you see phofcode and new position be before 'n' character ne2.
**note that after saving file, expected behavior is what correctly happens in file data, only display behavior is incorrect.
** **note, that this worked correctly in windows 1803 with same ubuntu 18.04 lts joe versions.
the upgrade to windows 1903 broke this, reinstalling joe reinstalling entire ubuntu 18.04 lts distribution did not fix this either.
a new line should be inserted in the place of the cursor and the part of the file starting with cursor position was in should be scrolled down on screen and last shown line should scroll out (disappear) and cursor should move one line down.
you see phofcode and new cursor position be at beginning of line2 **note that after saving file, expected behavior is what correctly happens in file data, only display behavior is incorrect.

the scrollback buffer should be cleared and control returned to the user almost immediately.
the contents of the window should scroll up by 4 lines, revealing 4 blank red lines at the bottom of the screen.
since the `profiles.json` file (appears to be) intended for user manipulation, its formatting and layout should be left as-is after a user changes it.
this can be important for users who manage their settings via a git dotfiles repository, e.g.
- device flow kicks off and you can connect to azure
- device flow kicks off and you can connect to azure
defaults to an existing profile or uses a default
pscore should still load its profile from

i expected this sign to work as it is one of the most important commands in posh
ping.exe terminates when terminal session ends
the tab should close fine and not block the entire application.
it should be noted that the first tab closes normally if you type "exit" (and chose to "closeonexit").
launching code from the wsl command line shouldn 't break tmux.
`@` sign is printed to console
console runs with animated background playing.
(identical steps on colleagues 1903 builds works as expected)

if there is an error it should fallback to a default config also see
when dragging the scrollbar with the mouse it should scroll back up in the terminal output buffer - always, independent of recent window size changes
when an empty string is provided, it should take the same path if the icon value was null or invalid falling back to no icon at all.
information should stay the same.
shouldn't break and should render all the characters like below powershell0 phofimage wsl0 phofimage cmd0 phofimage
if you have 10 tabs open in the terminal window and suppose you are on the 5th tab so you should be able to scroll to 10th tab to close it.

when using methods of the standard .net core system.console class, they should work as documented.
also, wt and conhost should have the same behavor (unless conhost is wrong)

title bar should be on the same row as the tabs.
- tab title should match with `name` in `profiles` in `profiles.json`
not sure, for my particular issue i managed to fix this by changing the `closetab` command from `ctrl+w` to something else.
just like when `pwsh` is in `c: program terminal should generate a configuration using powershell core by default.
* i can use `alt+}` as keybinding for the `nexttab` action.
* or at least i can find my declaration for the `nexttab` action.
if the font is missing or wrong, keep consoles by default, but don't crash maybe a hint or a message error, but don't crash

i expect that terminal would open with powershell 7
`acrylicopacity` should remain on `0.7`
launch another powershell console tab
when selected text gets wrapped or moves downward (due to previous lines being wrapped), selection should follow.
selection should start at first character in line.
at windows subsystem linux terminal you start editing some text file with joe editor.
when file have more lines that what current terminal have and you scroll down/up, lines at the screen scrolls with you.
this works fine with nano/pico/vi but not with joe.
only text should be padded (i think)
the window is larger and imputing text acts the same.
the terminal continually runs ripgrep against all files on the drive
the build finishes successfully and i can launch terminal.
settings file is left untouched when the terminal opens.
the window should be surrounded with a thin grey border: image phofimage
the visible area of the window is cleared of everything except the cmd/ps prompt, and you can no longer scroll the window view to see any part of the file you displayed.
this is what happens in old console window (conhost.exe).
this behavior is from my main display image phofimage
the expectet behavior like wsl command line, would be to paste the text exactly as copied with right click on the selected one, with all line-breaks image phofimage
the second exited pane will close, leaving one pane open.
the tab, or the whole window, closes.
* cursor should return to the previous position following the last character on the previous line after hitting backspace.
* additional input character (sent after backspace) should show up after the last character on previous line.
both tabs should be started in /home/xxx
`ls` works correctly the third time.
find dialog is brought up
said text to be pasted
i can find the text properly
`cls` should clear the screen and make the terminal behave like it used to before `wsl nano`
setting up build tools should work
color scheme should be set in local windows terminal instance.
as per the previous stable windows release, colors should be applied correctly and continue to function while using the terminal
the case of the files should not be changed and the command line build should complete successfully.
the new cursor shape should continue to work in the terminal and stay ticked in properties.
`echo`'s output oughtta fit in one line
all foreground text should be white
windows terminal should run normally
when pasting into a unix-space session -- such as wsl -- pasted text should have a reasonable set of line-ending characters.
i need to start pwsh by the following command line (note that the following command line is in cmd, or you can start pwsh normally using createprocessw.)
phofcode here is the windows terminal configuration file (the command line has been properly escaped): json { "startingdirectory": "guid": "name": "windows pwsh (7 preview)", "colorscheme": "campbell", "historysize": 9001, "snaponinput": true, "cursorcolor": "
i'm thinking the cursor should automatically hide when printing text.
i've seen this done in a few other terminal programs.
selection should stiil be responding to cursor movement.
this is how it works on conhost.
fade is nice ,but a less aggressive flash.
after the last command the terminal should display all integers from 100 to 999.
backgroung image changes to what i have selected.
close the terminal (really, i would like readine completion)
i expected to see the same thing i saw in the terminal - specifically multiple lines.
find msvc 160, compile using that version; or, give an error and tell the user to install a version of msvc which is compatible with terminal.
i expected phofcode to contain phofcode
all text should be visible
window position is restored to were it was in step 3 above.
which is what i get if i ssh from a regular powershell core (conhsot) console.
two cmd tabs are closed and powershell is in focus
text should be selected as normal
the keyboard input should be working properly
expected to see the terminal open into the linux bash.
trying to open the cmd.exe produces the same error.
for me to be able to use the ubuntu side of things.
scrollbar should be scrollable after content passed the screen
the terminal should show the character(s).
i would expect the prompt not to interact with the characters.
in `c: projects >` the `>` symbol should not connect with any font ligatures.
key executes the specified psreadline function.
the `/d` parameter to be parsed when the `/min` parameter is also included to the `start` command.
for this, d should be invalid and isvalid() should return false.
the date should show as invalid.
you should not be able to continue navigate with arrow if you try to navigate before or after the mindate , maxdate
the digit `1` representing the first day of the month should be interpreted as the day 01, but moment is interpreting the first digit of month as second digit of day.
the duration between two moments which are 1 year apart should be a year.
i perhaps incorrectly expect `moment.unix(date.now() / 1000 - to return "55 days" (should i use a different moment constructor?)
i definitely expect `moment().subtract(55, to return "55 days"
the day stays at 29.
moment can correctly identify that it is actually valid.
when i try to parse a full iso8601 format with timezone offset information into a moment object, and when i format it back to iso8601, i expect to get the same effective point in time.
i expect the moment object to be set the date, time, and also the timezone offset exactly as specified in iso8601 string.
however, it would be still ok for timezone offset be changed during that roundtrip, if only absolute time point remained same.
should return true for both cases
this may be due to germans preferring this formatting, however, i believe for consistency it may be better to have users add the "."
to not crash and fall back to `en`.
i was expecting a more detailed time display, like "in 2 hours and 30 minutes".
i cannot have a schedule where it says in 1 hour, when the difference is 1hour 59 minutes or 1hour and 1 minute.
expected: returns both dates from the array result: returns an empty array
action: _console.log("end of 03 week: " "yyyy[w]ww").week());_ result:
the output should be and not and
moment should consistently account for leap years when calculating day differences.
the expected date object should have been `sun dec 01 2019 gmt+0530 (india standard time)`
1. first day of the week in the us should be monday or day `0` not `1`.
phofurl image phofimage i'm using moment 2.24.0. is this a bug or is my understanding bugged?
as a workaround, i am doing: { week: { dow: 0 } });
"in" word should not appear, as documented in the docs.
should correctly output the isostring value.
i would expect to get "1 second".
time indicated on both websites should be the same in seconds.
the expectation would be to invalidate the date as overflowing
for two different date diff durations i expect to get a different number of days.
i expect one to be 10 days
the value should be 1 code - var ad = "mm/dd/yyyy"); if (ad._isvalid) { var ds = "mm/dd/yyyy"); if (ds._isvalid) { //expected - 1 ; actual = } }
its should show false and date should not create because its not a valid format
the code should always print "true"
instead this should behave exactly the same as using `day: '0'`, `date: '0'` or `date: 0` where it is flagged as an invalid date phofcode
since we define an interval with a constant length in days, simply based on a different starting day, we would expect the length in years to be constant.
in that case: 1005 days, so years, considering 365 days in a year.
my output to be in 'dd/mm/yyyy' format which for the current value is
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i expect that the daylight savings check to work in docker.
the date should not be valid
it should return difference as 2 hrs.
`moment.updatelocale()` should ignore the non-existing locale or fallback to `moment.definelocale()`, and gives a warning just like what `moment.definelocale()` did .
i expected 8 to be returned because i thought was the same as
ex: for value 15 -> "15inci"
at least the behavior should be consistent.
the moment.js documentation about parsing says: > moment(...) is local mode.
ambiguous input (without offset) is assumed to be local time.
unambiguous input (with offset) is adjusted to local time.
from that statement i'd assume that the time zone specific details (like dst) are considered the same way the native `date()` object does it.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
moment object for last month (12th) december of year 2019. please run the following code in your environment and include the output: phofcode phofcode
it should 've produced date phofcode because that 's 7 days from phofcode i 'm using google chrome on imac.
( don 't know if that 's helpful) moment version phofcode please run the following code in your environment and include the output: phofcode
the resulting timestamp is different
the moment should be acting just like the string when converted into a date
it should work as previously with version 2.23.0
"minutu 3" / "segundu 3"
i would expect the legal situation to be cleared and the result being documented with an accompanying comment below the stackoverflow link.
must return 1 but it returns 0
i would expect `p64d` to be interpreted as `2 months 4 days`.
as one can disagree on the length of a month or year in terms of days, a configuration option with good default is expected.
._d.toisostring() should return exactly the same date string which was originally passed to moment constructor on step 2: - browser chrome - version 2.22.2
i would expect the date to be the same, since the moment object keeps the information, or at least get day right
`moment.duration()` should always return a `duration` object.
only dates after are in daylight savings time
it is expected that when the `date` is undefined the returns is `false`
`yarn run webpack -p` should work without any error.
i only want to bundle what i want
moment should correctly display the next day:
i expect the first date to be a valid.
isbetween returns false for all invalid dates
i think it would be more correct if the library return when operating on in this case it currently returns which is not correct.
it rolls the week over from 52 to 1 but does not roll the year in same way.
23 march 2018. returns: 23 2.
29 march 2019. returns: 29 3.
27 march 2020. returns: 27
for the date to be valid and near the original date.
honestly, i'm not sure, i don't think the week number should change before the year has changed.
changing the year beforehand would be unexpected behavior on itself, so i think the solution should be to allow for week 53 to exist in these cases
we expect the correct date to be generated by moment.
for a given week in 2018, a 2018 date is generated, not a 2019 date.
i expect it to replace the one item in the locale configuration and set the locale, without reverting to en-us locale
it should return correct datetime with timezone
there should not be a display of `&nbsp;` in the before.
autocomplete should select the selected item.
by setting a maxwidth, overflow:hidden and textoverflow:ellipsis, i expected to see a narrower chip, displaying the first _x_ characters of the string, then an ellipsis... and the delete button should remain visible.
expected behavior would be that the position of the dropdown would match the location of the select element and display correctly.
import should work as in javascript
when a key event of type enter is executed i need to change the focus to another input.
currenly i fix this on a fork implementing a prop for useautocomplete named "afteronkeydown" and called at the on the the "handlekeydown" default actions.
you can see this implementation: phofurl but im not sure if this is correct aproach.
oninputchange has to be fired only when the textfield has really fired
i think the options can be hidden while `loading` is set to true.
the component property should not throw errors, unexplained "no overload matches this call".
expected behavior is as we write on the input, options below should get filtered as on most of the examples under autocomplete.
prod build should produce the same result using typescript or js.
clicking on a select should expand the list op options attached to teh bottom of the input as in material design guidelines e.g.
i think it should be switched placehold and icon.
<--edit--> i found related issue.
if you have a plan fix it, i want to do this ius phofimage
shift+home should result in all text in the input being selected.
i want to view my component working
the docs for the `radio` component phofhyperlink state that > any other props supplied will be provided to the root element (iconbutton) the `iconbutton` component has a property `size`, so setting `size` on `radio` should work as well.
the typescript typings seem to be correct as `size` is recognized as valid property of `radio`.
when using the component prop the intrinsic html props for the component are passed through to the component without type error.
a badge 's visibility should be toggled by the properties "showzero" and "invisible", regardless of where the badge 's "anchororigin" is set
there should be no error.
the label animation occures correctly, the label move to the top of the textfield
select should lose focus or lose it after clicking outside of it again.
dropdown icon is centered-align as in with `<textfield variant="contained" ... />`.
given the same array of objects, i would expect that typing 'a' would filter all objects whose values do not contain 'a'.
right now all values are still shown because the letter 'a' is present in all objects (because of the 'label' property)
i expect the dropdown arrow to remain on the line with the cursor
this should allow for styling based on rowdata and should retain the user's pagesize selection even onrowclick.
i would expect that the default font size is `1rem`
expected ** step ** work right way
if there is no value for the select, then the fallback behavior should be to let the text input field render the label inline way it should when there are no listsubheader items, or be blank if there is no label at all.
the listsubheader items should not respond to clicks at all, as if optgroup was being used.
if keyboard navigation is used in list, they be skipped over as being non-selectable.
if the snackback autohideduration and onclose props don't change, it should call onclose with the timeout reason after autohideduration passes.
since it works with a circualprogress, i expected it would be properly displayed and placed according to the flexbox rules.
i would expect all elements to be able to be removed.
i know that this is not a select-react issue because the `clearable` option is set in the component and it does in fact remove all options.
`gatsby develop` creates a functioning footer player like so image phofimage it's odd really, the html in my code editor looks like this: image phofimage but the html in my browser after `gatsby build` has grids + containers in it: image phofimage
it should be possible to pass the disabled property and add css override classes when the buttongroup is disabled.
tooltip with html customization should show
all items should be visible.
in the `renderoption` prop, the second parameter's key, `inputvalue`, should be the text the user entered in input field.
the element shouldn't respond to the enter key when there's no input
pressing <kbd title="arrow down key"></kbd> on an expanded node that has children should select the first child element ( * calendar * ).
deleting an item from a multi-item autocomplete should delete the correct item, instead of the first item.
my custom rules should win over the default rules.
radio button should have a "black dot" appear on the inside, indicating a selection.
instead, i think height should not be controlled by `xs` and similar attributes on grid items.
you probably should use `width: 100%` rather than flex-basis when an item is directly under a column container.
the workaround i am using is to specify the width without the attributes, e.g.
if wrapped in a form element, the return key should trigger a submit of that form.
possibly, if the `disableclearable` prop is set to `false` then the return key _could_ be seen as clicking the "x" button to clear field.
if it is set to `true` then it shouldn 't clear anything!
form label doesn 't change focus like this for checkboxes.
i really think this is a bug, it needs to follow the line of the row.
after the user selects the first option, the user should be able to click inside the (already) focused input to trigger popup.
the user should not have to lose focus on input to trigger popup again.
when you click outside, the input should be cleared
the styling and fonts should have worked normally
the expected behavior is that the chip i try to remove is removed.
- voiceover focus is placed on the first suggestion in the listbox when swiping from the input field.
- the user can easily find the suggestions without having to explore-by-touch refer to authoring practices example ( phofurl where listbox is placed as a sibling to combobox.
in this configuration, i can find suggestions as expected by swiping forward from input field, even without `aria-owns`.
at least something to happen.
now you're just stuck trying to figure out what's happening.
either default to an empty array, of have something logged in console to warn about it (e.g.
like react does when changing from `uncontrolled` `controlled`).
i want is to clear the text field area when i hit the button submit.
actually i 'm reading the documentation of autocomplete api and there is no option to do that.
1. i should be able to highlight the x button with the keyboard.
2. i should be able to remove chips with enter/space when highlighted
the props of the style object should show all props, including the default props
- the autocomplete component should not assign its own id to the `<input>` - the id assignment for the `<input>` should work the same as in the vanilla textfield component.
- the association between `<label>` and `<input>` for end user should be intact.
- there should not be an axe error.
any number of arguments sent to original onchange of custom inputcomponent should be passed onto the onchange callback
i should be able to use `props.mydefaultprop` in jss callback.
when user hasn't supplied any value for it.
it would be great if i could use a component to fit my needs.
i was hoping that if i put any plug on enter key in my onchange handler to input, but i can't even check if that would work, because can't tell if enter is pressed or any other key.
the backgrounds of those inputs should have the same borderradius as their input's border without having to use an override image phofimage
the buttongroup should apply the correct styling to all button related children.
the role used should not cause an accessibility error.
all components will be semantic ui besides the button i'm trying to render it will not throw an exception.
only a single copy of the children will be created (if that 's the issue).
console.log should be called only once.
`disableunderline` should work, no matter if the `select` is disabled or not.
the page stays on the current scroll position.
the speeddialactions should remain responsive even while a temporary drawer is opened.
in all cases, the height of the divider component should be calculated as the height of its parent when set to `height: 100%`
both first and second header row should be sticky.
to work normaly with custom varaint.
you should get assigned the correct value and unit to the `lineheight` property as it works with other css properties like `padding` or `height`.
expect datepicker dialog to appear and function the same as when it isn 't inside a menuitem with onclick.
1. screen reader should read dialog after open it.
2. focus trap shouldn 't cause that again reading whole dialog.
the tooptip should be shown.
speeddialaction 's onclick should execute instead of the component speeddial 's onclick
modal should retain the child element tab index.
you should be able to customize the above style classes as described in the documentation for formcontrollabel phofhyperlink .
the component should respect the applied classes to `tooltip` through the `tooltipclasses ` prop regardless if the labels are always shown or not.
ideally, a placeholder is shown, or space is reserved for where the ad will appear.
this way the page content doesn't slide down when it loads and it doesn't disrupt the reading experience (i understand that disrupting the reader is purpose of ads, but i don't think it should be purpose of docs).
maybe new skeleton component can be used for this?
apply only one class `muibutton-outline` in outlined button
select should not call onblur immediately when open={true}
hovering should not change the position / resize the inputs.
it should not auto format....
the adornment should be displayed to the left of the arrow or should push the arrow icon and clickable field to the left.
in version 3.6.1, clickable field with arrow icon was pushed to left when a adornment was added.
the bottom border should change according to specified styling.
the app should load and render components.
i think we should consolidate the version to `4.4.0` for both packages.
the `tooltip` should be always centered.
when trying to drag the cardactionarea, the parent should be able to listen to that event in internet explorer 11 just like it does in chrome.
there should not be a scrollbar.
a suggestion to solve this bug would be to add a `overflow: hidden` to `.muiinputbase`.
no errors, keys continues to work
accept the following props without complaining: phofcode
firing event clicks should result in phofcode
no errors, consistent documentation and implementation
custom theme info should be forwarded with material components when using or a similar function.
the initial visible rows of the textfield should grow until reaching rowsmax.
works as expected in safari and chrome
it should be rendered like chrome/firefox is doing.
it should give focus to the field.
i guess in the same manner as seen in `nativeselect` demos.
there should be an example of how to use material-ui and react-router together that doesn't have compile errors.
or... if there's specific versions that are required, they should be documented.
i don't want to be redirected to the old version.
expected the popover to open and for the page to stay in the same scroll position regardless of the current zoom level in order for popover content to be visible, also expected to be able at least drag viewport in order reach relevant popover after jump (solved it by overriding `touch-action: none` css for backdrop, but was confused by its default value)
i expect to to match for all "printing situations", regardless it is started from "browser user action" or "programmatically".
and it should work on firefox in general.
in attached demo - i expect to have "this should be hidden with usemediaquery."
paragraph to be hidden in all "printing situations".
the package should not rely on deprecated packages
after resizing, the popover should still be positioned as specified in `anchororigin` and `transformorigin`.
that in versions 4.x.x we can add spread functions of objects like styles.
the secondary action should display correctly in line with each list row.
the user should be able to set their own role attribute by passing in a prop, just like how the message can be set.
grid children with the `xs` prop should be and stay fullwidth.
a workaround for now is to add {width: '100% '} style to the grid children.
i 'm pretty sure this issue wasn 't present in earlier versions.
`isemptyinterface<{}>` should return `true`, even when `"strictnullchecks": false`.
re-rendering of `<select>` and `<radio>` elements when state variable updates.
`animation` rule works with prop-based adapting & interpolation.
the items should have consistent behavior on the initial render, and subsequent re-renders, and also on different browser rendering engines.
a typography component with variant h4 should match a box component with fontsize h4 image phofimage
when the dialog is open, i can focus unrelated parts of the tab (e.g.
the divider should still be there regardless of an backgroundcolor set
material spec: kapture at 14 42 57 phofimage see: phofurl
font-weight of menuitems shouldn't be affected by the value set for subtitle1 in the theme.
this started happening after upgrading mui to v4.x.
it did not happen with mui v3.x.
should not be off center
since the component uses forwardref, the types should reflect this and typescript shouldn't complain when using the ref prop.
the demo would not result in runtime error (e.g.
maybe it can show a snack bar message indicating invalid input or we can add validation to the text field?)
the placement class should correctly reflect the applied placement of the tooltip.
the class names are changed according to the `generateclassname` for both server side and client side.
installing non-latest versions should not ship both versions of `@material-ui/styles`.
i know that this can be resolved by tweaking the webpack configuration to tell it to load the correct version, but we would prefer to actually fix this issue.
solutions i can think of: - export `stylesprovider` from `@material-ui/core`.
this is the only reason why we have `@material-ui/styles` as a dependency, we import other style-related references from (such as `withstyles`, `muithemeprovider`, `createmuitheme`, etc.).
this would be our preferred solution (unless it 's already importable from `@material-ui/core` and i missed it somehow).
- make `@material-ui/styles` a peer dependency of `@material-ui/core` instead of a regular dependency, so that one and only one version gets installed by consumers.
i would expect the rule counter to reset on a new render of the tree.
i 'm pretty sure what 's happening is it 's render once, incrementing the rule counter, finishing.
and then when it starts the next render, it 's not starting from 0. so solution should be to just create a new function after temporary render, and provide it somehow.
i just have no idea how to do that, and couldn 't find it in docs.
horizontal bar should not appear.
i think grid container { width : 100% } and grid item { padding: (8 * spacing / 2) } are enough.
scrolling on dialog should not trigger swipeabledrawer to slide
1. you are able to use the 'tab' key to move focus to next/previous elements 2. in the initially focused input, the text cursor is visible
the panel should expand when added dynamically
nested theme should be dark.
it would be great if there was either: 1. a way to have non-button children of `buttongroup` (i 'd imagine this would be ideal, because it makes sense to wrap `tooltip`s and other things around buttons in groups?
2. have a way to have a badge that doesn 't involve wrapping it.
hide tooltip as soon as the trigger element is no more hovered by the cursor and avoid the appearance of a second scrollbar.
radio buttons should work as expected
outlined textfields on secondary tabs should have a properly sized notch to contain the textfield's label.
1. chip presentation doesn 't break.
grid items should maintain their width when using `direction="column"` and no breakpoints.
list of options should remain positioned relative to the select.
import * as react from 'react'; import { overridablecomponent, overrideprops } from ** export ** interface cardmediatypemap<p, d extends react.elementtype> { props: p & { image?
: string; }; defaultcomponent: d; classkey: cardmediaclasskey; } declare const cardmedia: 'div'>>; export type cardmediaclasskey = 'root' | 'media'; export type cardmediaprops<d extends react.elementtype = 'div', p = {}> = overrideprops< cardmediatypemap<p, d>, d >; export default cardmedia;
able to use the `useref` hook with the `ref` prop on a material ui component
menuitem text is vertically aligned image phofimage
when a non-native `select` component is opened inside an `expansionpanelsummary`, the styling of the `expansionpanelsummary` should remain the same.
render correctly styled element immediately
i should not get an error
the last select should be blurred.
there should be no error and esc should close the dial.
you should be able to scroll the moment there is more text than can fit in the textarea.
should not be able to input t
ts3.5 gives no errors, probably is due to this (comments) phofhyperlink .
we should change type and make `href` optional.
i've tried it, but i am not sure if the types of `buttonbase` have other dependencies
i expected the outline to dynamically change space to wrap new label
the 'icon' should be displayed in addition to the expand/collapse icon or the documentation should be updated to reflect this behavior.
the border should not be connected.
phofcode css fallbacks should be presented in the result css
the expected result is that the new styled component keeps the original component styles and apply the "component" prop.
each string in the array should go to its corresponding thumb 's `aria-label`
`fab`s and `speeddial`s should be able to be grouped like other buttons
`makestyles()` and emotion 's `css` method should work together.
`onchange` should be called once when clicking a button.
safari layout looks the same as chrome without having the need to change the styles and overwriting the width for grids with spacing.
duplicate styles shouldn't be added.
the tests should pass just like it does when the scrollable prop is not passed on the tabs component.
the menu should appear just below the button that is its anchorel.
not applying all body2 styling to the body element
when using !important in a style interpolated by props the style should update on prop change.
the ref passed to drawer should be added to the root element when `variant="persistent"`
i expected this to work normally, since i used it with mui version 3.9.3 without problems.
the `name` or `id` are somehow accessible within the `onchange` handler.
the togglebuttongroup onchange event fires as it does when the jsx for the togglebutton is inline with the jsx for togglebuttongroup.
does not produce type error
expected the mui switch to toggle states like it does in chrome for desktop and chrome for ios 12.4.
a second instance shouldn't be injected.
it should respect the first instance on the page.
the grid spacing prop returns correct padding based on the theme spacing return value.
should be able to do more with content than just a string label (thanks for adding tree view btw!)
should move around freely like in chrome
instead of rendering default arrowdownward icon, i want it to render arrowdropdown icon image phofimage
button should be visible without breathing effect.
the same way it is when chrome has focus all the time and is not switched to background.
the theme should work on mui builtin component as well.
the `<head/>` functionality that next.js provides should work as expected without a crash.
should not be two props with the same name (ignoring capitalization)
i would expect the `avatar` style (color/size) to be consistent across dev and prod builds.
to not select those fucking menu items when i type in the input
the `collapse` element should render the content in the dom like the expansionpanel does: phofurl
drawer content should be scrollable if the screen height is not big enough, no matter the anchor value.
expansionpanel accepts and processes transitionprops in the same manner that that the textfield component processes inputprops
expansionpanel accepts and processes transitionprops in the same manner that that the textfield component processes inputprops
the grid items should stretch always to 100% width.
from the definition: > an extra parameter `isappearing` is supplied to indicate if the enter stage is occurring on the initial mount
label shouldn 't cover the text.
the `textfield` should function as expected, with the outline shifting over so that the when the label moves up it isn't clashing with the outline of `textfield`, inside of all tabpanels regardless of index.
screen shot at 12 49 57 pm phofimage
it should be able to pass component <img width="1015" alt="image" src=" phofurl
the line should not show up behind the label when the container with the textfield becomes visible
i expect codemod to affect the file and transform the first import into phofcode
the tooltip disappear onmouseleave even if the child is disabled
to be able to use material ui in a shared component library built with webpack and for the components to be usable in consumer apps of the shared library.
i 'd expect the style rule to be applied without `!important`.
an open dialog should not block input elements in the not child elements.
phofcode should compile with no error
shouldn't complain when passing attributes component should accept
not trow this error on our error tracking tool ( sentry phofhyperlink )
given something along those lines: phofcode these 2 things should both compile fine: phofcode this was working fine in material ui v3.x, and we started seeing this in v4.x.
the `open` state should stay to `true`.
the width of legend should be calculated properly
themes should work correctly with server side rendering
dialog is present in the dom at compile time using `gatsby build`.
when using `<snackbar>` with the `transitionduration` param set to `{ exit: 0 }` the snackbar should appear with its default `enter` duration and `exit` with a duration of `0`.
when starting to write "menuite..." in my ide (vscode) i want auto-import to suggest
be able to override root style for component like it is possible for other components.
suppose if we pass initialise state as - phofcode and suppose i click on the same item on the drop-down, the item should be unselected and the onchange method should receive an empty array instead.
an input that is force shrunk should not have the border intersecting with the label text.
when using chromevox as a screenreader on google chrome, tabbing through table header buttons should announce if a button sorts a table and the current sorting & direction.
examples of tables that work with chromevox: phofurl phofurl
* jss should not create empty style tags * jss should group dom updates
styles created using props should work the same as styles created without props i.e.
phofcode should create the hover state in the same way that this does: phofcode
when there are nested grids gutters should cancel each other but the outer most gutter
opening a `popper` with an autofocus input inside it, should not cause the page to jump (scroll).
drawer should appear without jumps.
backdropprops property should be documented
tooltip should show for custom components with properties spread as per documentation.
no error when putting a multiline `<textfield>` in an with a custom font on firefox.
hitting esc closes the dialog.
i have a bunch of textfield arranged vertically which is longer then the device screen so i must vertical scroll to reach all.
touch scrolling with 1 finger should work as expected on all platforms
animationname should render the correct jss keyframe animation name.
the older (v1) textfield retains focus when adornment is clicked: ezgif com-video-to-gif phofimage
i would expect adding an `arialabel` prop to a speeddialaction component would add an `aria-label` to the produced `button` element.
a component that extends overridablecomponent should not be required to have a component property.
i was able to fix this simply by adding a question mark to the interface definition phofcode becomes phofcode ...props: { component?
when i use a menu like a dropdown with onmouseover, when i dont go on the dropdown, the dropdown doesnt close by itself (see example)
should run in production mode without error ?
all parts of dialog should be visible no matter how much content is in dialog
phofcode the above line shouldn't throw a ts error when used for spacing transformation in themes.spacing.
i can use a component library which is using mui components with `yarn link`.
in the documentation phofhyperlink we have: > you can change the default props of all the material-ui components.
so, i expect that i can override default pros for `modal` component.
i'm not sure if it's a design or a bug.
but i think this `onrendered` method should be allowed to be executed even if portal is `disableportal`.
otherwise, it can't be called a `onrendered` name(it's not inappropriate).
the dialog should close after pressing esc
classes provided to component have always the highest priority.
the children should not be unmounted.
it is expected that the first item of a menu should be focused by default when opening the menu.
this should occur because the default value for the "disableautofocusitem" prop is false.
explicitly setting this prop to false, and "autofocus" prop to true, does nothing however, indicating that feature itself is broken.
`divider` and `icon` components should respect `color` override within a `muidrawer`.
clicking anywhere on the select component should cause the dropdown menu of select options to display
based on documentation the default element rendered for dialogtitle is an h2 element.
<img width="877" alt="screen shot at 9 21 14 am" src=" phofurl
a jss element should not be auto prefixed by the prefixer if we specify that it should not auto-prefix it, somehow.
grid should be responsive even when the page is loaded as `xs` width.
when using box phofhyperlink the generated media queries should be in correct order
when an empty textfield with a label loses focus, the label should transition down to look like a placeholder.
should be able to use elevation and square props on grip component in example sign-in-side phofhyperlink in tsx without tsc failing
as with `@material-ui/core@3` the extra theme fields ( i.e.
colors ) should not be removed
setting the css property font-size should over-ride the default font size.
when a renderer for `<textfield multiline />` is created by no errors should be thrown: phofcode
`muithemeprovider` is exported by `@matterial-ui/core` or a related package
progress bars should not animate.
it should appear below the navbar and centered
clicking anywhere on the select component should cause the dropdown menu of select options to display
the import should work as before with v3.
by using injectfirst, mui styles should be injected faster then other styles (styled-component in my case)
injection order would be the same in dev and prod.
unit test should pass without errors
when linking the module to another react project using `yarn link` or `npm link` and using the `<boilerplate />` component, it should work and display "hello world"
after opening the menu in the simple menu demo (and other menu demos), the arrow keys should change menu item focus.
overriding a dialog's style class worked in version 3.x, i expected this to continue working.
i didn't see anything about this mentioned in the migration guide, under dialogs phofhyperlink .
i _do_ see the following.
> [modal] remove the classes customization api for the modal component (-74% bundle size reduction when used standalone).
slider should render properly in a container with any text-align css property set
interacting with input fields and buttons should be possible after dialog window is closed.
either transition components to be fixed, or provide new arrow working sample as expected.
the page should not scroll to top on click on appbar menu items
i expect that when you clicking on a close button of the dialog, the snackbar will disappear.
should not fail type check: phofcode
video should stretch edge to edge on all browsers including ios.
the should be no specificity conflict between classes.
a listitemicon inside a listitem with should line up with the list item text if there is secondary text.
this used to work in v3
the description for the `size` property should be: > specify the size of the cell.
by default, the table parent component set value (`medium`).
the description for css class `sizesmall` should be: > styles applied to root element if `size="small"`.
when a button is focused a repeating keydown those not restart the ripple button-ripple-repeat phofimage
when clicking the option, the `onchange` function should be invoked, and the value of the field should be updated.
with the code below, in the function passed to `styled`, `theme` should be typed as `theme`: phofcode
it should keep the the base styles for the tablecell
when use the mui theme with rtl.
the action icon should mirror just like the text
when i open a dialog and change the state of the dialogcontent the state should be reset once the dialog is closed.
that way previous state is not persisted when dialog is opened again.
when using makestyles and using props on some class or property, if a html element have multiple class, the priority of a element should be based on the order of declarations of elements.
using a dynamic and static style should have the same css rule precedence.
this should pass type check: phofcode
`texttransform` should work in typescript with `makestyles` and `theme`
switch layout should not depend on how i use/import iconbutton.
it was expected that the "column" value would be accepted in the flexdirection property in a styles object of the withstyles function.
as in the mdn definitions phofhyperlink .
i expect the up and down arrows to be usable after opening the menu when there is not an empty option and the component does not have a value.
open the select options normally and don 't have a reload because the transition
it 's supposed to check the selected radio option.
when the switch is turned on, the light halo should disappear in a second or two.
menuitemprops should be typed with correct 'button ' override by default the when imported
when opening a select, the first non disabled item should be focused if no previous value has been set.
when i change the rowsmax prop of a mounted multiline textfield, i expect the height of the textarea to change to reflect the new rowsmax prop value.
updating rtl component will have no affect on appearance of the app.
`muicssbaseline` should keep the current `type` i guess.
the style of the muichip delete icon should change.
the given `action` handler should only be called when the function mounts.
it should receive an object as a parameter.
the select autowidth should set minimum with for the popup paper menu.
no regression in a bugfix release, unchanged `withwidth()` behavior on the server side since 4.0.0
rounded timeline icon color should be the same as any other icon color.
no warning in console, when using buttongroup and iconbutton.
the outlined border color should change from grey to primary color (when focus) across all breakpoints
compiling with the included ts declarations should not throw errors.
the down arrow in the select input should open the select when clicked
the example provided in the documentation should display `true` when javascript is disabled.
hot updates do not delete <style> elements, that material-ui injects into the head.
using `props` inside of `makestyles` should not cause a large performance difference
link should has same default variant as typography
cursor must be visible in safari like in other browser
image phofimage the header class should override `.muipaper-root` and hence show blue color instead of white.
hook styles should be rendered after the default material ui theme styles.
the button on vertical slider should line up on the track.
when using `<input type={ 'button } value={ '420 '} ...> ...` the value shouldn 't be empty.
rtl should work with both makestyles({}) and makestyles(()=>{})
chips in a chip array should be removed on clicking _x_ by looking over the example for chip array phofhyperlink .
we see chips do not get removed as expected.
i can go to an old version of the docs (e.g.
phofurl and search links will work
select is rendered properly via redux form field render function
i'm using typescript with react-router-dom, and have buttons to do the routing.
i've followed the excellent guide from here phofhyperlink .
however, as i don't want to copy/paste the forward-ref code to all my components, i made this an exported constant, like this: phofcode however, when importing in my component, i get a typescript error at my <button> definition.
after some analysis i found out that the inferred type of exported constant is different compared to when defined locally.
the solution is explicitly defined type in exported constant,: phofcode
when applying a class to override the default style for an expansion panel, the override is applied
the `cardactionarea` component should accept an _adapterlink_ component in the same way the button component does, as stated here: phofurl
searching the v3 docs for "typography" should land me on phofurl
`tooltip` should have correct position in rtl layouts.
the box css should take precedence over the child component class.
in mui v3 losing focus of the window would stall the timer for a snackbar and then resume when focus was returned to the window.
opening a modal behaves like the other browsers and the page doesn't shift
form labels should not overlap content.
the `value` prop should update the empty string in case of wrong numeric value like `1...2..` clearing the input on such values should be done on blur activity probably.
`linearprogress` should become rtl for rtl layouts.
only the dialog content should get a scroll bar
how to override the styling of e.g.
all buttons on a page is documented well.
when you click on a radio button in any scenario (in a radiogroup or standalone), the dot appears in the stroked circle (as per v3.9.3).
the higher order component created with ** withstyles ** should behave the same way as the original component
image phofimage code above should render a text field like this: image phofimage
anchorel prop to validate when a faked reference object is passed.
when trying to set the anchorel to a menu component, i expect it to work fine without warning
i 'm using webpack to bundle my project, as many others does.
however i want some libs to be external and loaded from unpkg
tablepagination should use tablepaginationclasskey for it's `classes` property in the shape of string>>`
link component with `component="button"` prop should have `:focus` outline style which is important for a11y.
`speeddialaction` should appear in specified color.
`component` property should be accepted
when using `<b>` or `<strong>`, the font will be shown as ** bold ** .
material ui should not have an opinion about what bold should be, especially not one that * isn 't * actually a bold font variant to begin with.
the open menu should touch the select and should not move to the right side.
the following should work: import { createshallow } from
after a user selects a value in the autocomplete, an x appears that can be used to clear the field, reseting it to blank.
as a user i would expect to see the "hand" style cursor since this x is clickable like a button.
the module should install successfully.
creating components like phofcode should work in phofcode
the expected behavior should be the same as in desktop.
when you touch a listitem, it should get highlighted, as if selected = true.
starting animation(ripple) then button background disappears
when menu is opened, if the user tries to scroll using a browser scrollbar.
scrollbar from background content should not be visible
dialog should keep open when textfield is focused.
when i pass the align prop to the typography component, i expect it to align regardless of the variant.
no build or type errors are expected when styling material ui components with styled components or emotion.
`trapfocus` ensures focus is kept on elements within its react element spanning tree.
the drawer should open on swipe
``makestyles`` can be used in class component context
`yarn docs:api` keeps `<br>` tags
menu should show up when on fullscreen mode.
a `<portal>` should be able to be mounted with `disableportal` set to true, then changed to false.
for example, .muibuttonbase-root should be present once only.
it should be possible to define a line-height for the `caption` typography variant for instances where the caption wraps to multiple lines.
when i set the line-height of the caption, i expect it to render with that line height.
the generated keyframe names would be in the form of just like the class name identifiers.
classnames should be compressed like "jssxxx"
i should be able to type something into textfield when my dialog is draggable.
according to the documentation phofhyperlink , i should be able to override the notchedoutline css by using `classes:{{ notchedoutline: classes.foo }}`.
i expect to hot-reload material-ui components just fine at all newest versions.
phofcode docs say should remove the underline from the nested input field.
we should be able to access and override the props of the buttonbase element rendered by the listitem element when the props "button" is set as true, especially ripple effect.
phofurl is working for browser ie11 important info: phofurl or phofurl do ** not ** show this issue.
select should be getting vertically aligned with textfields
adding a startadornment to an input component (input, filledinput or outlinedinput) should not force the input label to start in it's shrunken state.
it should work exactly the same as if there were no start adornment i.e.
the label starts at full height and only shrinks when a user focuses on the input.
the input should look like this on initial render: phofurl and like this when a user focuses on an input: phofurl
phofcode should always show no less than 3 rows.
rowsmin prop should be passed down from textfield to the consuming textarea when multiline=true
this is what i see in firefox, with beautiful round corners: image phofimage
the scrollbuttons should not be throwing the empty button error.
should apply the styles defined in the override, as per the docs phofhyperlink .
`onclose` on `dialog` should have the correct typings: `(event, reason)`
modal should be static when you move your mouse in and out of the window
tried `import { palette } from but since there are no typings generated, ide throw an error
i want to get the reference to the component class so i can call the class methods.
yarn test should run as before without issues.
1) click on slider 2) focus is on slider, slider is highlighted with focused styles
on click on material ui select dropdown, the menuitem is coming to select the options.
as an user i should be able to type and search the keyword as well as it is in normal select dropdown
i 've created a code sample: phofurl it is a barebones `create-react-app --typescript` with the minimal changes to illustrate my situation.
in it, i have a `mylink` component that simply creates an `<a>` and spreads the provided props to it: phofcode i want to use that as the `component` for a mui `<link>`.
in mui v4, i have to use `react.forwardref` do that, but it won 't pass typechecking: phofcode
the slider thumb should smoothly react to mouse dragging.
if i mark a `grid` as both a `container` and an `item`, then the direction property specified in the parent `grid` should be respected (either `row` or `column`).
if the `grid` has sibling `grid` elements, for example, they should all appear in a row.
and i make a quick fixed by following code.
phofcode phofimage it's not a perfect solution but better than nothing.
need min and max props for native datepickers or pass the non default props to the native element.
when using the `select` component with the prop `native: true` (or `textfield` component with props `select` and `selectprops={{ native: true }}`) i should be able to use a react component for the label in `<option>` i.e.
created component as a child of dialog e.g.
simple native form the child component should render one time only when opening the dialog
when i render this phofcode it should like this in dev and production image phofimage
static properties/functions should be inherited by wrapper functions such as withstyles
tooltip should be aligned correctly.
dom should be updated only in those parts that were actually changed - styles should not be rerendered if the theme was not changed.
chips should wrap (or at least have a prop that allows wrapping)
placeholder should disappear when the field is not focused (ie edge).
when the prop is set to false, i expect the `<tooltip />` / `<popper />` / `<portal />` component to not exist in the dom whenever the tooltip is closed (`open` prop set to false).
if `open` prop changes from `true` to `false` before `<portal />` component gets its ' mount node and re-renders, i 'd expect tooltip never exist on dom (or at least immediately clean itself up after attaching dom)
when i click tab over panel items it shouldn't go inside summary section that is in closed state.
cardmedia background image should cover the div and be centered.
the outlined textfield component should resize its borders properly when a new label is passed in
should work without errors in production mode.
the outlined textfield should have 8px "padding-right" for endadornment.
the title in the toolbar should be aligned correctly.
in the following app, the poorly typed `myref` does not generate an error when passed to `<input/>` but does generate a type error when passed to `<input/>` phofcode
the dropdown icon should transform to dropup icon (also highlighted with primary color) when the select field is focused.
after migrating to 4.x, i followed migration guides phofhyperlink .
i expected that everything works great then.
the swipeable drawer should only be opened when the swipe starts _on_ the swipe area.
that means, it shouldn't start if there is anything on top of that area, e.g.
typescript should not throw an error if you use properties which get passed to the used component.
considering the following code phofcode i expect that the loginbox would take priority over the base material-ui root-classes.
basically, i expect to be able to use the box under test environments (jest snapshot testing, storybook, or just unit test inside material-ui)
when rendering tabs, negative margin should not be placed at the bottom if the system doesn't show a scrollbar, as is the case on mac os when using a mouse that doesn't support touch gestures.
trying to use usemediaquery instead of withwidth phofcode
the textfield type number should show the placeholder when state value updates to undefined.
i should expect to be able to use box with typescript
should render my box component
the slider should swallow the touch events to other parent controls cannot react to these events and to another action for the same interaction.
when any modal is open the window scroll position should not never change.
i am using `muithemeprovider` to change the color of a button component.
i expect this to work without error
warning shown only when total height of popover * exceeds * the available viewport height and not when the height is * equal * to the available viewport height.
pressing the "tab" key should bring focus to a `listitem` with props `button` and `component="a"`.
page should fast with large amount of data also.
the react console should not show a warning when using a button with a ripple
when a `select` menu is open and there are options marked with the `disabled` property, they should not be able to be active or selected.
there should be no console errors when using `textfield` with `multiline={true}`
styles must flip in `rtl` mode.
getting the focus and enter carriage opens the menu item.
this pr phofhyperlink introduced the ability to set the default variant for textfield in a custom theme.
it's not included in the typing file in `componentspropslist` though.
this is my project in development image phofimage
while providing custom svg icons to steplabel in stepper mui classnames should be attached to the custom svg element.
select popup should need to be displayed on right position.
required message behavior should be the same as for standart html input.
clear console in chrome dev tools due to material-ui warnings related to wrong (?)
`rendervalue()` function should always be called when the selected value changes - even if it changes to an empty array as current value.
drawer with an elevation of 1 has a 1dp elevation for the underlying paper when paper is is defined in classes
- default typography theming injected into root
i would expect the drawer to be accessed either via tab after showing it (or the first focusable item to be focused upon showing)
`yarn workspace @material-ui/core --watch` has the same result between runs
yarn test should run the typescript tests
maybe a warning would be more appropriate here, or a more useful error
should be able to run full set of unit tests successfully.
listitem should lose focus after mouse out.
when i click on the open left button to open the drawer, i expect `<sidelist>` to render once.
same thing when closing the drawer, i expect `<sidelist>` to render just once.
i also tried `<drawer>`, it has the same behavior that children are rendered 3 times when expect it to render just once.
tests should fail if the tab index or focus does not match expected results.
- the toc active entry should be updated correctly when the page is scrolled quickly - the fragment id should be removed when the page is scrolled to the top see: `e7a255bc - handle &#39;` for correct behavior
the select menu should open when selected and you press enter.
after upgrading my material ui from an older 1.x version to the latest 3.9.2 version, i would expect that i have no webpack compilation errors.
visitor should be spammed at most once with dropdown popup to help translateideally targeted at locales that would be able to help with a language.
after i create a component from or `styled(component)({})` i should be able to use the overrides as i would with `component`.
in intellij/webstorm ide, when importing component and using it in jsx, prop and validating should work as it did in previous version 3.9.x.
there should be no scrolling
order shouldn 't matter when defining the style object, should it?
no matter how many rows per page are selected, it should look nice, have a normal space between the number and the dropdown list arrow of the select.
hovering the mouse over right or justify buttons should not highlight left
letter-spacing would be the theme's default;
phofimage it should look like this: annotation phofimage
the textfield should not be rendered with a scrollbar when only a single line is required.
i should be able to use `createsvgicon` in tsx files.
trying to render the paper example w/ the styles/themeprovider in 4.0.0
the component will be displayed successfully.
dialogs and modals should trap your browsers focus when tabbing to just that open dialog of modal.
this is for accessibility and ease of keyboard use of a site.
the breaking behavior is when focus reaches the last focusable element of a dialog, the focus should loop around to the first element.
this is described in these phofhyperlink recommendations from w3.
when using the disableautofocusitem option on menu, the arrow key navigation should still work.
the styled function should still work when i pass in a component prop.
using a `tooltip` component with `disablehoverlistener` around a `textfield` component should display the tooltip on focus
from this accessibility guide phofhyperlink that lighthouse links to: ensure that each button element and elements with role="button" have one of the following characteristics: - inner text that is discernible to screen reader users.
- `aria-labelledby` pointing to element with text which is discernible to screen reader users (i.e.
not `display: none;` or `aria-hidden="true"`.
- `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` (aria 1.1) and is not in tab order (`tabindex="-1"`).
i create a theme using offwhite grey colors and i expected the components to respect that
i expect to be able to route to different routes without errors
my makestyles function should be passed the populated theme object, and withtheme and usetheme should return the proper non-null theme object.
i'd like to be able to set the default props of `inputlabel` (and possibly other statics) without typescript throwing errors at me.
the **css api** section should exist and document `"root"` / `"ol"` / `"separator"` classes.
adding "&$" in front of the "selected" should fix the problem
`withstyles(theme => {})` use theme that i provide from `<themeprovider>`
snapshots should create reliable labels for withstyles() used by both custom and defaut material-ui components like in the red portion of this snapshot: <img width="706" alt="screen shot at 5 29 11 pm" src=" phofurl
mui `<style>` elements are inserted first, and user `<style>`s come next.
this is the behavior we're seeing up through `@material-ui/styles` `3.0.0-alpha.4`.
css injection order should be like this: app1 mui css app1 overrides css app2 mui css app2 overrides css
the title in the /css-in-js/api/ styled section should match the implementation, just like the example does.
change response of update/add style element in head and update component with current classname reference.
it should render without any errors
when creating a texfield with `select` option without a `name` it should either ** not ** add the id or `name` should ** not ** be optional.
fontawesome icons should be rendered.
`button` component of material-ui on clicking should do nothing (unless you specify onclick)
when using the new `@material-ui/styles` and `@material-ui/core` together in the same project, i can successfully compile the project using the `tsc` compiler.
my input ref should be called and assigned before componentdidmount.
it should render component without error.
import cssbaseline from and rendering the <cssbaseline /> should "inject" a style tag _muicssbaseline_ in the head, which contains css rules <style data-jss="" ...css rules </style>
when i use codesandbox here phofhyperlink to build my code, the order of styles is right.
the slider can be adjusted without a horizontal scrollbar appearing.
the user of my component should not be required to provide a `classes` prop.
when opening and closing a drawer, as in the persistent drawer example provided in the docs, the underline on the tabs component should adjust to size of content
the example usage of usemediaquery found in phofurl should compile using typescript.
the codesandbox example should display the component that is wrapped with `faded` in the same manner as it is displayed on the fade transitions page example - phofurl <img width="1157" alt="screenshot at 23 36 43" src=" phofurl
sample: phofcode a red background button :)
animation should be a smooth continuous loop without a jarring start / finish
no build or type errors are expected when styling material ui components with styled components or emotion.
it compiles and the dependency is found.
whenever a menu is opened and an item is clicked, the action responds.
padding around `listitem` is `24px`.
able to use material ui hooks and apollo hooks together.
`shrink` prop should be correctly set to `true` when input is focused via `autofocus={true}`, css should change to reflect focus state
the following code should not throw a type error: phofcode the above code runs flawlessly using `// @ts-ignore` phofcode
<img width="131" alt="screen shot at 11 29 08 am" src=" phofurl
when page is long and scrollable, the dialog scrollbar should appear "over" body scrollbar without padding on the right.
it works fine when the body is not long and it does not have a scrollbar.
only the border from paper should be displayed for a crisp look.
all codesandbox examples are working
documentation should load in ie and look the same as it does in chrome
css styles should be applied in the correct order
i use this code phofcode and want it to use in my functional component like this `const classes = usestyles();`
lists in dialogs are properly alligned with the dialog header and other contents.
when you open two dialogs at different times, the order that they appear in the react component tree determines the order they will appear in the dom (which affects their visual stacking).
before, the cardactions button appeared to be in the proper position, see below <img width="897" alt="screen shot at 11 53 35 am" src=" phofurl
material-ui typography should work with ie11, but it have arrow functions instead of any another component.
expected behavior: `const styles = theme => ({})` should be `var styles = function styles(theme) {}` but now it 's: phofcode
`<select>` should accept `native` as `boolean` attribute.
navigate to phofurl on firefox 64, look for disabled text field example, try to select `hello world`.
user be able to switch between popovers without crashes
demo page contains bottom appbar demo.
only the first cell should be rerendered.
using one of the icons and applying to it an inline styling from the `style` prop it should apply correctly the style and all the inherited styles to icon even when server-side rendered.
i'm not sure if this is a bug or an expected behavior, but slide sends the prop direction to the children
the tooltip should be centerd on the top of plus icon button
when using a `tabs` components with a custom child which renders a `tab` component as it's only child it should work as if i'm writing the tabs as direct children of the `tabs` component.
pressing backspace/delete should clear the selected option in single select react-select autocomplete demo, just like it used to happen with previous versions.
class names created using `makestyles` should be unique
onblur effect should be removed.
even if it's non-standard way to manipulate inputs in react, we should be able to reset the `input` state by doing `this.inputelement.value = ''` same happens when using `formelement.reset()` with a wrapping `<form>` again, i know it's not the recommended way to manipulate form elements, but i'd still expect that it behaves like natively if it's not possible to fix this small bug (without the 'brutal' hack way), it's fine
search results in dark mode docs should have a dark background
when a slider and a textfield are used side by side i assumed that the textfield would lose the focus when dragging the slider around.
so that when i check which element has the focus, slider is returned.
just being able to use decorators for `withtheme` & `withwidth`.
move your mouse above speed dial with persistent tooltips and show the tooltips aligned
`selectinput` typescript typing for `value` prop should be required as it listed as a required prop in the component `proptypes`.
when making a production build the compiled styles should be non-conflicting.
the focused switch in off state should look like this: expected phofimage phofurl
on hover of the `<grid>` element the block should change color.
according to the docs, it looks like i should be able to pass the whole css api listed in input, but i cannot.
in the following example, i would expect the modal to be full screen.
in stepper i have textfields when i click the next page label should properly.
the onkeydown event inside dialog should not trigger the onclick event on the opening button.
tslint shouldn 't throw any error message.
what should happen is check selectprops to see if native is true before assuming menuitem and render option or menuitem conditionally
both dialog boxes should close, with no error.
`textfield` support object value when property `select` is `true`.
i would expect non-auto-sized grids (i.e., grids that specify breakpoints) nested within auto-sized grids (i.e., grids that do not specify breakpoints) to fill the available space without wrapping text.
`disableunderline` input prop should remove underline for textfield with `variant="filled"`
grid should render with comparable (or at least in the general ballpark - we all get ie11 isn't as good as chrome) performance in ie11 vs chrome.
if an uncontrolled input changes to a controlled one it should throw an error
using arrow key navigation in a menu component should skip over any contained divider elements when changing focus.
in material-ui@v3.6.0, here we have a new component fab which is extract from button.
i try to use it with typescript.
change focused element through [<kbd>shift</kbd> +] <kbd>tab</kbd> should not change scroll position when some `modal` is open by default.
slide animation should not overflow body.
i am rendering a tabs component with `scrollbuttons="auto"` and `scrollable={true}`.
the number of tabs i am rendering causes the scroll buttons to display at all times.
if the initial `value` correlates to one of the tabs hidden on first render, the tabs component should scroll to display correct tab and show it as selected.
the error should not occur.
when clicking on textfield it has custom border color.
it should ignore the `fullwidth` property, in fact dialogs with `scroll=body` are in fullwidth mode already, but `fullwidth` breaks everything.
another thing is in combination with `maxwidth=false`, where padding doesn't exists.
i 'd like that background color of listitem was 'red '.
should be show correct date when scroll to selecting date
the list should render as <ul><li></li></ul> so it is valid html and passes accessibility testing.
if mouse up event happens while dragging an item over 'backdrop zone' then the item should be released without firing onbackdropclick event.
it should render components in iframe as well
the latest version 3.5.1 comes with new feature: > allow accessing the component's props from within the style object.
i guess import order shouldn't affect look of my component or i need somehow preload styles of my dynamic components
i 'm using a theme as follows: phofcode when using `listitem` with `button=true` i expect it to use the button font from the theme: phofcode
when i right click on an item, for example the cardactionarea, the shouldn 't stay.
expansionpanelsummary should fire onblur event when it loses focus
when calling ondelete on a chip.
the event should bring back its proper name.
the generated import statement should be:
the presence of `tooltip` components should not affect print styles in any way as.... you can 't hover over something on a piece of paper.
configuring the speeddialaction button to use a link component should update route on click on both desktop and touch screen devices.
tab labels with text that exceeds two lines should be truncated.
this seems to be the desired behavior according to the material-ui documentation phofhyperlink : > long labels will automatically wrap on tabs.
if the label is too long for the tab, it will overflow and text will not be visible.
as well as material design spec phofhyperlink : > tab labels appear in a single row.
they can use a second line if needed, with truncated text.
when i pull the slider handle to 100%, and then release it, all of the handle should still be clickable.
resized icon looks exactly like original, but with proper size.
selecting falsy values should not cause the group to render any differently than truthy values.
i expect i can pass an valid javascript date string into the component and have it render the correct value
when i create radiogroup > formcontrollabel > radio, i expect the radio element to transition in/out when the value changes.
css renders the same both in ssr and js modes.
the keyboard should not be able to navigate focus to the disabled menuitem in a select.
the slider thumb moves to the edge of the window if possible and releases if the click is released outside the window.
1. label should be held up when adornment object(s) is/are present 2. label should be allowed to collapse when adornment is not present
scrollbar should scroll the content, regardless of previous action.
when i use `createmuitheme` and override `spacing.unit`, i'd expect that unit to be used in the `theme.mixins.gutters` method.
position at the right position
no error should be thrown
the auto suggest input field should work like a regular textfield.
tabs are aligned with the same space (12px) at the top as at the bottom.
the buttons should be sized consistently
during server-side rendering, the generated class names should be the same as the generated class names on the client even when using `styled` material-ui components.
popover with `transformorigin`: `bottom` & `anchororigin`: `top` is expected to always render just above the anchor
both drop down lists should work without errors.
in ie 11, when i click on a switch/checkbox/radio, it should change the value and perform the animation.
content width and scroll bar pop-in should happen together with page load/reload when using a drawer with variant= 'temporary ' and dynamically loading other app pages.
that is namely the behavior of the other two variants.
it should work like this: (example from **video demonstrating correct behavior** notice how content resizes and scroll appears the moment the link is clicked.
correct phofimage code used in demonstration: phofurl - 1s transition phofurl - default transition
native selects appear at the same size as their non-native counterpart as well as other input fields.
when there are no values selected then the placeholder value should be shown.
when i want to test `slider` component, i could test it without error in jest + jsdom environment.
including `button`, `iconbutton`, or `buttonbase` in my application should display the specified button.
single touch on the slider should change its value.
using grid to define column layout, i expect items with sizing props (like xs={4}) to have dynamic height but the width should be constant.
when any form or text field with inputadornment is in rtl direction, then input label should be right aligned and adornment icon should not overlap label or text of the input.
i would have thought wrapping the tab would have had no impact to the functionality.
when the textfield or select renders with input in it, the label is rendered above the input and the line moves away.
the tab indicator should be at all circumstances under the tab after navigation is ready: image phofimage
in a dark theme, the text of the control should be white and stay that way when the control is focused.
snackbar should be centered vertically (if at all, personally i don't think centring snackbars vertically results in a good ux).
this can be a potential improvement: phofcode
expect that installing material-ui/core would work properly
long tab names should wrap in internet explorer 11.
i 'm trying to use react-router-dom with buttons.
thankfully material-ui provides a example phofhyperlink for this exact case in the docs.
the described approach in the docs does not seem to work properly when using typescript.
it seems that the props of the passed component does not widen props of button.
therefore i get a error that passed `to`-attribute does not exist in props of button.
i expect the radio button to be checked when i click on it
tooltip should disappear after modal opening via router link
the id or name should not be empty.
the "shape" theme object would be defined in the default theme.
should not give error message
native typography deprecation warnings should not be logged; as this leaves the developer with no means of resolving the warnings.
moreover, it would be assumed that subsequent upgrades would automatically resolve the internal warnings.
accordingly, any material ui component which internally references deprecated typography variants should be transparent to client code.
i should be able to build a component that is styled: phofcode
tabs' indicator fills all available space on page load.
there are no breaking changes from 3.1.2 to 3.2.0 when using material-ui without webpack or a similar bundler.
icons are shown once they are loaded.
before that, they should ideally occupy the space that they will eventually need, but not display anything there (i.e.
the error color for the textfield component uses the color `#ae001a` as underline and label color.
maybe the deprecation warning can be ignored for code in the material ui library itself?
`snackbar` should use a `<div>` as its container element.
the `ondragstart`, `onchange`, `ondragend` callbacks should be called in a consistent order.
`<input name="select-example" type="hidden" value="1" required>`
when using `textfield` component, the type of `inputprops` should be the type of props for the internal input component defined by the value of `variant` prop passed inside `textfield`.
if using variant `filled`, `outline` or `standard` (also default) type of `inputprops` should be set to or `partial<inputprops>` respectively.
css should not mess up in production build.
when testing there should not be any failed prop-type checks.
no errors should be threw
click-ability of the chip should be determined only by clickable property
textfield with no labels shouldn't have extra padding on top.
expect the popper to render outside of the card and not be subject to the overflow:hidden.
speeddialaction onclick should trigger when click the actions.
the `handlechange`-event for radiogroup phofhyperlink and formcontrollabel phofhyperlink should include the htmlinputelement-type: `(event: value: string) => void;` and `(event: checked: boolean) => void;`
clicking the label should give the input focus to the underlying input field.
overriding the selected class with a different colour should update the label and icon colour.
the buttons should be sized consistently
no error should be given
webpack should not throw the above error.
the placeholder should behave the same on ie11 as it is on other browsers.
once the user focuses on the input the placeholder appears in text field as label animates and is repositioned above placeholder.
<img width="167" alt="screen shot at 11 03 49 pm" src=" phofurl
when "overflow: hidden" is already on the body element and modal is open, it should be removed when a dialog is closed, but not overwritten by the drawer

after clicking on iconbutton component, the ripple starts spreading from the spot our pointer is in the moment of the click.
cursor is shown at the end of the given value when autofocus is set to true with a value.
menuitems should have their default display set to block, not flex (likely inherited).
grid container shouldn't be setting width
a list with an indeterminate checkbox, like in the documentation phofhyperlink , clicking on the indeterminated checkbox in its indeterminated state toggles to "all".
when you enter an invalid value into `textfield` of `type="number"` the label should stay where it was - above the value.

the font in the input box should be "roboto", "helvetica", "arial", sans-serif;
if is set in the theme than all textfields should fullwidth by default
classname strings on components should update correctly on all of them, when using dynamic theme.
when the drawer is open, the content gets `aria-hidden="true"` and drawer modal gets `aria-hidden="false"`.
when drawer is closed, the content gets `aria-hidden="false"` and drawer modal gets `aria-hidden="true"`.
i believe the value you get from the onchange event should match the type you can supply in the component props.
when a bar is tapped, its submenu should expand then stops once the whole menu appears
when drawer is closed, the page should not scroll to top
the width of the actual icon should be set to max 30px
when i touch start on a list item in downshift in a mui popper, the item value should be selected and the menu closed.
clicking on a button with a touch ripple should fire click event right away on ff.
when using the grid system, with `alignitems="stretch" direction="column", it should order the grid items by column and stretch them to be full width.
this works, but only when a cell size is not specified.
using the gatsby example during the developing phase (`gatsby develop`) and build (`gastby build`) i expect to have the same styling and functionnality.
when sorting a sort-able table, the rows should be able to be selected and associated with the correct row.
on non-touch boxes (mac, windows), these buttons work.
you can see the ripple effect and the action happens.
this includes chromebooks that do not have touchscreen support (a hisense 11).
on touch-screen boxes, i expect the same.
even when `scroll='body'` is specified, the `fullscreen` is honored in the `dialog` component.
- ssr to render the app with correct styling.
once app is hydrated remove the styles that were injected by the server.
custom icon passed into steplabel has the same size as default ones.
i would expect the npm start command to compile and load the site successfully
'i' should be rendered as '' when uppercased.
in a typescript environment, when i pass an array of one or more `react.reactelement` objects to the `action` property of the `snackbarcontent` component, it will not cause a type error on compilation.

able to add forced scrollable tabs as a child of the toolbar component without invariant error.
i expected that the `typographystyleoptions` would fully support the type scale defined in material-ui ( phofurl
when i set the `checked` prop to `true` for a checkbox, i expect the `checked` prop for the `<input>` tag to be present.
it shouldn 't get applied to the native element, and just set under the `getchildcontext()`, and then extracted to not be included in the `...other`.
the cardactions should always be lined up to the bottom.
using nested theme, overrides only portion specified by a "child" theme.
for example, phofcode i would expect that nesting `localtheme` under `globaltheme` would result in `palette.primary.main` to be the same, but `palette.secondary.main` different.
after inputting something into a textfield, clicking away from the textfield should work normally.
icons in the app bar should appear exactly at the center of the bar menu even when drawer direction is right to left
passing the `disabled` prop to a textfield should also apply the disabled style to the label and helper text.
if i provide a value of label to the prop `component` of the `listitem` component i should also be able to provide the prop `htmlfor` so phofcode should crate this html phofcode
the menuitem should display on the correct screen resolution without producing warnings.

material ui should work when using parcel
in the current versions page ( phofurl when one clicks on the documentation link for v1.4.0 the documentation for said version should open.
when creating a theme, i would expect that i could do this: phofcode ...and basically have nothing happen (e.g.
the empty object overrides no default values, and everything works.
autocomplete control should work smoothly, even if there is large data in suggestions list,
snackbar opened from a dialog should be shown.
i would like the file upload selector to only allow certain file types.
in my case, mp3 files only.
when select dropdown has focus and i press a key that matches one of the options, it should highlight that option.
the native select is exhibiting this behavior.
i also tested the native html select tag and it is also exhibiting this behavior.
phofcode the `testprop` should be passed along with other input properties when instantiating `numberformatcustom`: `<numberformatcustom testprop="yo" ... />`.
with empty values; the input label should shrink/grow correctly like other non-empty values.
this should be true especially if the ** select ** has ** showempty ** to true.
i could see this being an issue with it being false; however the select is being told to display an empty value.
it 's also not obvious how or when the shrink property changes as in my code it 's never set; it just happens.
so that tells me select component is doing it or formcontrol is doing it.
i should be able to put icons either to the left or right of the text, and have the buttons vertically align with each other.
the `<textarea>` created by a multiline textfield should be the same height on all browsers.

no matter where we place the ** snackbar ** it should always render at the end of the body.
modifiers are popper.js options, not a div attribute
refactoring stepcontent into its own custom react component shouldn't break the stepcontent component being displayed in the stepper component with vertical orientation.
should be able to override the `bar2determinate` styles.
a menu pops up above the respective button
this library should not use elements so wrongly that it is impossible to test projects that use it with standard automated tools.
it should be possible to use tooltip inside cardaction without above warning.
if you have an open tooltip and an `onclick` handler on the anchor which moves the anchor out of focus of the mouse the tooltip should dismiss as mouse is no longer over element
clickawayevents should work for all rendered clickawaylisteners
the tooltip should disappear if the parent component is hidden.
elements at the bottom of a full-height component like drawer should be visible on all browsers.
according to the snackbar docs phofhyperlink docs, the `<snackbar/>` component should be able to accept a number for `anchororigin.vertical` and it should work like the `<popover/>` component.
the next component 's `componentdidmount` setting of should not be cleared out.
the ui should adapt to viewport changes
according to material design, long labels should be correctly positioned within the available input space: 13 49 06 phofimage

below code should display the door icons.
the snackbar should slide in without the scrollbars appearing.
phofcode to resolve to the deleteoutlined icon
this is my use case (expected behavior) - i have a table of selectable items - user can only select 2 in the list - once the user has selected 2 they can no longer select any other items - user can deselect one or more selected and then select up to 2 different items again user can keep selecting up 2 items only and deselecting to restore select-ability as long as they like
the body element has not a horizontal scrollbar.
tooltip should only show up when hovering on element.
the <dialogtitle> always remains at the top of the dialog, the <dialogactions> always remain at the bottom of dialog and only <dialogcontent> scrolls.
a working speed dial according to the docs when using typescript.
expected appbar to not scroll with page when setting position to `fixed`
i would expect to not see js errors build up in the console
the menu component should spread the `anchororigin` properties to the popover component to position the menu ( docs phofhyperlink )
should not throw a warning in the console and should not use legacy methods
when the tooltip is provided with a custom `flip` `behavior` (via `popperprops`, it should be positioned correctly, in the order specified, and with correct separation from the target to the tooltip.
when the speeddial is closed (no actions being shown) the action container should be fully colapsed and have no height, not triggering events such as hover, for example (only the fab itself should trigger the hover).
after `webpack --mode=production` command in webpack 4, the bulid must generate a css file, like the js bundle file
server and client will render without braking the ui
should apply the same style to select when i use themeprovider
when there is a value the field form control should have state filled set to true.
`<button autofocus>text</button>` should show the ripple on the button just as tabbing to it does
when editing a textfield i should be able to press tab to focus on the next textfield.
the progress should show correctly (spinning, loading, etc...).
display tooltip on user defined components
obviously i can solve this problem with my own code.
i will have to get a `ref` to the `<input>` element and pass `onclick`/`ontouchtap` functions to my `inputadornment`.
but it would be nice if we could make it easier to do this with less code, and, i think it actually might be sensible by default automatically focus the `input` when the `inputadornment` is clicked.
but help me figure out if i 'm overlooking any problems that would cause: * `button` or `iconbutton` inside an `inputadornment`: not a problem, doesn 't affect focus * `checkbox` or `radio` button inside an `inputadornment`: not a problem?
if the user clicks it, they probably want edit text field next.
if unchecking disables `input`, `checkbox` might lose focus... if this isn 't desirable default behavior, what would you guys think about adding a `focusinputonclick` prop `inputadornment` and bit of logic handle it in `input`?
when using a tooltip component, on my secondary retina screen, i expect the tooltip text to be sharp.
`<row>` should take the entire expansionpanel as row.
the snackbar phofhyperlink should appear above the dialog phofhyperlink component.
`select` should normally close with the chosen value being the current in the `select` and the click-away trigger shouldn 't fire.
default props in a theme keep their prototype.
width and height of the tile should calculated into style, e.g.
style="width: height: 204px; padding: 2px;".
i'm adding a custom fontfamily to typography through `createmuitheme`.
it automagically picks up the custom font from a `/static/` directory, which is awesome, but i've been completely unable to display anything other than a regular (400) font-weight.
i've been through all the internets trying out different @font-face methods in .css, .jss, and related solutions with no luck.
can anyone help me see what i'm missing?
i wanna know how i can sort my components so that in the end first the mui styles are inserted and after that the ones for my components.
the tablebody in table should be scrollable if i give it a fixed height with overflowy: auto style
when modal is higher than viewport we should be able to scroll the page.
- `button` component accepts any component as `component` property.
- typescript accepts properties of provided component as properties of `button`
the button should change color on hover.
select must lose focus after user select option of the focus, or we need to provide an instruments to call ** .blur ** on ** onchange ** callback of our select element.
the `tab` component has a fullwidth prop, but the default `maxwidth` in the component implementation is set to 264px phofurl
it should be possible to change values for more than one slider simultaneously.
i have the following component: phofcode when i click the checkbox i expect only handlecheckboxchange to be called.
pre-1.0, we didn 't need `typography` all over the place, font styling cascaded.
so my component would have looked like this: phofcode and i was able to smoothly do: phofcode in 1.0, my component has to look like this: phofcode and i would absolutely expect to be able to do this: phofcode if necessary, by using `shallow = createshallow({ untilselector: 'withstyles ' })` instead of enzyme 's built-in `shallow`.
when a tooltip isn 't showing it can 't block any elements from receiving pointer events
as in v1.2.1 and below, when a dialog's content is too tall the content was automatically scrollable ( sandbox phofhyperlink ).
i expect a simple modal component with slide transition
material ui to compile as part of my project.
on endadornment toggle, the position of placeholder should remain the same and must not flutter (chrome)/move (safari).
phofurl can 't be visited
when i put a tabs component in my app, the page should load/work in ie11.
should be correctly spaced at 95-99%.
`backgroundcolor`should be applied without `!important`.
also, there is a weird ripple effect with color equal to `color` which you can see on example below, which i am not sure is a correct behavior.
as it's happening in the documentation, the menu popup should be re-positioned to always be within the content of a screen.
component that leverages theme + withstyles with custom variable doesn 't fail.
i have a component that i wrap with `withstyles`.
i only wrap the top level index with `withroot` (where the theme is added to context).
how to easily use `shallow`, `mount`, etc.
how do i get the theme into the context?
feel like this should be an easy fix, but can 't find a good example for this.
see test results in codesandbox link.
button ends where content starts.
(see sandbox) capture dcran a 21 16 10 phofimage
the list item content will be aligned to the right.
this is a gif of the expected behavior on development machine.
notice the notification is displayed fine and the rest of the ui is ok. materil-ui-dev-working phofimage
the `size` prop should set the size of the element.
> and it does but it doesn 't take effect because the class in a dialog sets the `min-width` to `64px`, so anything less than 64px will have no effect.
should be able to add `required` attribute to the `<select>` input and it should: - add `*` to label - add `required` attribute to the rendered `<input>` tag
'left' should appear on the left side, while 'right' should appear on the right side.
possible to open and interact with the select component using the keyboard while a screen reader is opened.
this works perfectly when the screen reader is not opened.
the table "sorting & selecting" component demo phofhyperlink should make it easy to follow react best practices.
so, if i quickly change `data` for `this.props.data`, it should just work: phofcode
i would expect not to see the error from title for components i am rendering in my react render method like so: console_errors phofimage
i load the documentation site in firefox, and the drawer on the left opens
`import { rootref } from '@material-ui/core'` should work.
selectfeld should have the possibility to select on keypress (enter or space); onclick it works perfect there wasn't such a bug on v0.20.0.
`onblur` is not called when clicking an action.
ssr and csr have same classname
i expect element to be repeated as usual.
i go to material-ui-next.com and can use it.
i expect the cursor to move to the next input field.
if you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen.
if you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work.
`<circularprogress />` always rotates around its own midpoint
when trying to get the ref of a grid component, i expect it to work as the ref of a regular component
when i click on link in helptext, it should not shift focus to input element.
sometimes you need to have a textfield inside radiogroup (e.g.
when a value is needed in addition to a radio option).
if user types in this textfield, the onchange event should be triggered.
server side rendering more than one app shouldn 't cause react prop warnings to be logged.
the multiline textfield should be the same width as the textfield multiline props = false.
if the slider is disabled, changing its value using the knob should not be allowed/not work.
'test' should be yellow but mui overrides the mui theme provider: image phofimage { color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87); //black font-weight: 500; } .muisteplabel-label-64 { color: pink; //overwritten } .muisteplabel-active-59 { color: yellow; //overwritten } `
`input` component should have `normal`, `dense` and `none` margins (adding `normal`)
currently code is working in chrome not in ie 11
after the mouse click has released and the animation completed the ripple effect should dissapear.
i expected the dialog to accept the prop and set the dimension to paper width 'md '.
no extra characters (source from ime) should be taken into textfield.
slider can change its value e.g.
demo page should render without an error.
on window resize the translatey property of the hidden snackbar should change or recalculate its size to make sure it 's totally hidden from the screen.
**the component should obtain focus when clicked on and filter suggestions when user keys are typed.
the values set for 'select' and 'selectmenu' should be set on different elements.
above code to work after upgrading "@types/react"
add an ondragstart handler to the new labs slider.
expected: it should fire on desktop browsers with a mouse, as well as touch devices.
popover body should be flushed with anchorel screen shot at 14 21 08 phofimage
the `onclick` on the `menuitem` should pass as an argument the appropriate array element when it is used inside map function.
when a tooltip is assigned to a disabled item, the tooltip works like normal.
no console warnings or errors are produced.
when pressing <kbd>enter</kbd>, the link should work.
portal should render a drawer that appears after pressing on the menu icon.
the `tablecell` should have a right padding of 12px.
the component should rerender on receiving the prop and show the dialog as open depending on the boolean value.
the material components on webpage are functional when visiting the webpage with chrome.
this should be the case with firefox.
it shouldn't show warning when user tries to use property showlabel or showlabels in bottomnavigation or bottomnavigationaction
menu in select field should open
expected to be redirected to the github page regarding muitheme which is provided as a link called "sources" on the documentation page under the themes page.
adding phofcode to the inputlabel component should prevent the animation.
when i call snackbar with contentprops as such: `<snackbar contentprops={{ 'aria-describedby': 'notification-message' }} />` i would expect contentprops property to be passed to snackbarcontent component.
icons (both the `<icon>` and specific icon components like `<chevronright>`) inherit their parent's `fontsize` so that they scale with the text
no warning should be issued
`import tablehead from should be updated to `import tablehead from
the source code compiles and the user can see the dome.
in this case, it does not.
turn tooltip into styled component -> use classes attribute to override `tooltip` class -> styles should be applied to the element
there should be no error.
i expect the the tooltip to render normally
clicking on the label, when it sits "inside" the input will focus the input.
component working and no warning at all.
properties passed per `inputprops` to a `textfield` should add properties to the native `input` element.
i would expect the id property to be visible in html of elements tab of chrome dev tools and be able to
both the v0x and v1x components should work in the same component
should open normally when clicked
material ui next should render with css upon loading of bundle.js in browser.
css classnames should not override each-other.
the icon should get set to the icon provided in the props.
i want to be able to select multiple rows and take the selected values to another array.
if the row is selected, it should be a part of the array here is the code sandbox: phofurl
dragging the screen on mobile devices shouldn't move it.
when typing spaces in input field, it will displayed as normal spaces.
i expect that a textfield with large font-size would look reasonably the same in safari as it does in chrome.
the raisedbutton icon and the label to be aligned with each other.
wrapping text in a grid item should not force it to not wrap
tooltip should be positioned to the right side of the drawer button instead of overlapping the button.
the textfield component with props type="number" should not accept any alphabetical characters
date & time pickers should works
given i am inputting text into a multiline textfield component and while typing, the input field goes out of my view (and/or the viewport) then i expect the window to scroll the textfield component into view
when i change a circularprogress' progress prop, i expect that the progress smoothly animate from the old value to the new one.
i should be able to compile the project with typescript without errors.
label does goes down if there is text in textfield
screen shot at 14 30 53 phofimage screen shot at 14 32 09 phofimage
to not flicker a horizontal scrollbar.
the labels' alignment should stay the same regardless of focus state.
ideally (and previously) they should always be left aligned.
if inheriting the parent's text alignment was a purposeful change in beta.45, it should respect it in both focused and unfocused states.
when adding new pages the global styles should be preserved.
i'm trying to use the new way to handle props for themed components.
using the props on `createmuitheme`, passing the props to the components.
open any dialog component on ios, and press on the background.
1 click in above situation should be enough.
label should move above the textfield value
good ux guidelines recommend to reduce the number of clicks needed to perform an action.
as opposed to modals and dialogs, menus are not expected to hijack the click away events.
the issue is that the background click dismiss a menu, has a `e.preventdefault()` which prevents it from bubbling up the other element.
in other frameworks, you can click on an other element, and it will have double effect: close up first menu, and show new one in one click action.
for reference: * bootstrap * phofurl bootstrap phofimage * semantic-ui * semantic-ui phofimage *sencha extjs* phofurl extjs6-2 phofimage uikit phofurl
i believe the reason i cant modify autocomplete using const muitheme = getmuitheme({}); is because it is not listed under getmuitheme.
switch component onchange(click) must be toggled
when a `listitem` has its `button` attribute set to `true`, it shows no highlighting, which is normal: default phofimage when the mouse cursor is dragged on the `listitem`, the later is highlighted, as expected: over phofimage when the mouse cursor is on a `button` embedded in `listitem`, i would expect button to be highligthed, but not `listitem`, as follow: expected phofimage
the `margin` and `min-height` css values should apply to the element.
when i open a fullscreen `dialog` on a mobile browser i expect to be able to only scroll that window content.
the context should be available to the svgicon class in scgicon.js
the `typography` component demo should be usable in dark mode.
when clicking the select component, the tooltip should disappear.
therefore, when the menuitems appear, they won't have the tooltip on top of them, and if your menuitems have a tooltip, it will still be displayed above other menuitems as you would expect it and tooltip would still be invisible after selecting an item in select component.
after the existing line of: `<typography>{'you think water moves fast?
'}</typography>`, add an additional couple dozen lines of the same.
i expect that i should be able to see all the lines.
text color should have a transition.
when i use an text field in a dialog and add the classname with only the width, only the width should change
the following style should be allowed: phofcode
it should align right, left or center according to the textalign given
for a listitem with button={true}, would expect i could use href property to specify a link.
the active state should work even though the wrapper component does not take value.
when speeddial is hidden, elements underneath its position should function as if the speeddial wasn't there at all.
when visiting phofurl the website should load javascript resources, i.e.
app-bar.js, _error.js, main.js, as specified in the html.
multiline fields work smoothly in any current browser
should be able to peruse the online documentation without any unexpected behavior, like sidebar items disappearing.
a user should be able to set both 'iconhovercolor ' and 'color ' within the style property of an iconbutton.
expected behavior would be that when a user hovers over the icon, it wil change from 'color ' to 'iconhovercolor '.
i expect the background-image to be rendered
show an unfocused dialog button
when using the tabs component and passing in an indicatorcolor or textcolor props value of a hexcode such as "#7c4dff" or rgb string like "rgb(124, 77, 255)", the tabs indicator and text color should use that color given.
the ripple effect should cover the entire button.
animation should be same for all kind of sizes.
when touching outside the iconmenu list, the menu should close as seen on other browsers.
expect equidistant spacing when showing multiple expansion panels in any browser.
this can be seen in the component demos on the material ui site phofhyperlink
button should lose focus after associated modal closed.
when using the dialog in ios safari with content that scrolls vertically off the page, i should be able swipe up and down at speeds relative to the speed of my swipe.
this is what happens when i am swiping on content outside of the dialog.
should not allow autofill in the datepicker.
autofill should not break datepicker.
spinner should not use much cpu or gpu
cardactions is same as on demo.
it should display all the tables in order.
i expect both of cases below can get the same display layout.
a good documented page with common components global style replacement documented.
it works as it does when doing client-side only rendering.
expected behavior is same as experienced with `1.0.0-beta.39`.
after this change phofhyperlink , i was expecting to be able to use the same icons from `@material-ui/icons` that i previously used from `material-ui-icons`.
having `iconmenu` that opens to a list of `menuitem` that all of them are clickable.
after the first click, `menuitem` will disappear
when textfield blurs and has no value, inputlabel should not shrink
opening a modal should not add any padding anywhere
when using a button to open a dialog, when the dialog is closed with either the escape key or clicking outside of it, the button should look like it did before the click.
after the input is resized the dropdown menu should still match the width of the display node (at least on subsequent renders).
i should be able to pass a string as children to `<listitemtext>` like so: phofcode since the documentation for listitemtext phofhyperlink states that `children` is an alias for `primary` and this works as expected: phofcode
clicking the selected component in the left sub menu should do nothing.
the behavior should be the same in the different browsers.
the minutes are disabled and we only can change the hour.
after picking an option from select and clicking outside the select container, `select` **must lose focus**.
i was expecting to be able to use the step component inside a custom component to reuse some parts in every step.
on beta v39 it work as it should no visible scroll <img width="1440" alt="screen shot at 16 34 08" src=" phofurl
`withstyles` should enforce to be present as a type in `props` of the wrapped component.
if it does not present, then compile should fail.
iconbuttons should have the same hover effect as flat buttons ( example phofhyperlink ).
swipeabledrawer opening swipe should work whether or not a setstate is occurring in background.
select options should be visible within vertical stepper content.
navigating on a `menu` using arrow keys must ** immediately ** highlight the current `menuitem` so user does not have to wait to see which items is highlighted.
it should take me to this link phofhyperlink
some type of window listener perhaps that checks for height of viewport changing below initial height on focus of input and enabling dynamic hiding of the bottom nav?
should be able to position content next to permanent clipped drawer
i can't select tab eight, without clicking the fourth tab first, and then clicking the arrow to move to tab eight.
when i use the ** menuitems ** prop on a ** menuitem ** component and i click on an item in the nested menu i want it to stay open, unless i handle closing.
the tests watcher should work and execute tests on the file change.
like over expansionpanel <img width="1151" alt="screen shot at 12 37 47" src=" phofurl
the following code should be valid.
the test case should have passed
i would expect: * either the documentation ( demo `menu` phofhyperlink , demo `appbar` phofhyperlink ) to clarify that the `handleclose` method is required on the component.
* or the component to behave correctly regardless of handler method names.
not sure which one is correct one though.
`paper` components when called with the prop `circle={true}` should display as a circle.
with this theme configuration, i 'm expecting the `body` background color to be `#ff0000` but it 's actually `#cccccc`.
speeddialaction should use a darker button color in themes where palette type is set to "dark".
it should launch the app normally with `npm start`
when visiting your website a drawer navigation on the right side is provided.
it consists of parent menu items like **geting started, style, layout, etc** and children menu items like **installation, usage, supported components, etc.
** clicking on the parent menu items should reveal other children menu items.
and clicking on any children item changes the content of the page.
`withstyles` shouldn 't inject a flex field into the `classes` object.
it doesn 't break anything, however, appears a warning.
i expect the `inputprops` to behave similarly to the `react-autosuggest` component ( here phofhyperlink ).
the `autosuggestprops` interface states that: phofcode where arbitrary input to the `inputcomponent` is allowed.
items should toggle on with onmouseenter event and off with onmouseleave event.
i expect all content inside the main content area to only ever take up as much space as the screen allows.
the tooltip shoud not be hidden when the cursor passes over it -- only when the cursor leaves the area of the attached element.
going to the component demo on the website phofhyperlink , then adding properties `{maxheight: 300, overflowy: 'scroll'}` to root.
after that, changing listitem count to 10.
`onscroll` has to work without delays.
i would wait that elements was in order `icon` - `text` - `icon` like in listitem phofhyperlink ** chatlist **
still cannot apply styling to the dropdown menu in tablepagination, even with a handle to 'selectprops' there is no way to set the styling on the rendered menuitem elements.
can you give me a prop on the menuitem within map function that renders options inside of select element?
flexible mutliline text field should be nested in dialog content without any react state update infinity loops
i would expect the wrapper to contain at least one level of children.
going to the component demo on the website phofhyperlink on mobile (or simulating with chrome dev tools), then tapping on the speed dial, which opens.
on the events `onblur` and `onclose`, speed dial closes and you can tap on it for it to open again.
the typescript type for onchange on select should be `string[]`.
also the docs says that onchange takes two arguments
import {table} from 'material-ui '; should work
in a vertical stepper each stepbutton should be aligned left and not centered.
when we use a appbar it should be already constructed as such like bootstrap navbar with materialistic ui principles
when you select the date and try to change year manually it should accept only 4 digits.
`formhelpertext.d.ts` should be updated according to the fix in #9823. we should keep in mind to also take care of the `.d.ts` files when fixing stuff or adding features.
i expect the snackbar to just work as it does in the demo
i am using the tab with "react-swipeable-views" animation like the example phofurl and i use the selection box like the example phofurl under tab content.
i expect switching animation can be shown as tabs example.
when specifying `multiline={true}` in the `<textfield>` component of the downshift example code, i would expect to see the selected value chips wrapping round on to multiple lines when they reach the maximum available width.
content is vertically centered regardless of the height of its children.
i expect to be able to do npm install, and npm start to start the app without error.
and `theme.typography.body1` should be used for styling inputlabel (the first or the second depending on `shrink`).
i expected that assigning styles via classes.input or classes.select would have allowed me to assign font sizing and colors to the menu that pops up to select the number of rows.
instead, none of the options give you a handle to assign styling the modal popup menu for rows.
<img width="815" alt="screen shot at 11 57 38" src=" phofurl
`onkeydown` in `textfieldprops` should be of type just like other related keyboard events, like `onchange`.
i have a select with a little bit more than 100 items.
when i open it and i try to scroll the items with the mouse wheel it doesn't scroll i have to drag the scroll bar.
it works briefly if quickly open the select and use mouse wheel.
it appears menu list is loosing focus after opening.
as a keyboard user, i expected to be able to delete a chip by tabbing to the delete icon to give it focus, and pressing `enter`/`space` delete it.
on the buttons demo page phofhyperlink , hovering over delete icon button should not trigger the hover state of edit icon button
experiencing runtime errors/warnings because of non-existing component classes.
`warning: material-ui: the key `rootinheritselected` provided to the classes property is not implemented in tab.
you can only override one of the following:
using grid to format radiogroup radio buttons shouldn 't break functionality.
dialog child components should be mounted only one time.
only render components inside the expansionpanel when it's open.
unmount components inside the exapansionpanel when it is closed.
the drawer paper should not show if it's closed and i resize the window.
i expect to be able to use values from theme breakpoints at `render()` time
when i tab to a selectfield, it either shows the menu items when i tab to it, or i can use the space-bar or return-key to show the options, and then use the arrow keys to select one.
and then tab next 'tabindex'.
expansion panel onchange should get called with expanded = false if it currently is open and true when it is closed.
when updating input value, i want the border color to change from green to orange when exceeding `limit` prop.
when opening a `iconmenu` with the animated prop set to `false`, i should not see a react error in my console.
should let me override sizesmall and sizelarge in createmuitheme overrides
content under the dialog should ideally not be visible when touch moving the dialog
the autocomplete options to hide the text element under them
a `<button>` should be rendered in the page
expect to have the updated available props in the docs
tooltip should be shown on hover
no warning because rootref is simply omitted
multiple select should render any component which menuitem accept
in build environments where `node_env=production`, when specifying `required={ true }` on mui elements that use `<formlabel>`, the label should be rendered with an appended asterisk.
serialized form output should have a field like {"type":"testval"}
transition animation on nested list component.
it works in documentstion phofurl
it should render the menuitems with the correct data.
changing 'previous page',}} to 'first page',}} should display the first page icon.
label should shrink, as it does for normal text inputs.
snackbar should show over the modal backdrop.
i want to be able to change the spacing of the theme without breaking the switch component.
i'd like the ability to transform the indicator style (namely `width` and `left`) within the tabs component based on the default value.
this would be in form of an optional function prop that looks like this: phofcode this function would be invoked either before setting `indicatorstyle` state value, or before style is passed to tabindicator child during render.
actually, there is an expected behavior with disabled attribute in `<li>` element, because the disabled attr.
cannot be used with `<li>`.
but when we set props `button` is `true` to menuitem, i expected to see in dom `button` not `<div>`.
and when we render the `<button>` to dom the disabled prop sets as an attribute to <button disabled>.
it is very helpful for accessibility and testing
the table component from the example page should show up.
inside component should be `div`.
if i have 10 item in filtered result if i pick 8th item, it should appear in the text box.
want to use components without error
`button` should preserve the styles.
will select or deselect all rows in the table body
not to have to trigger a re-render in order to pass a `ref` dom element as a property.
tooltip should be shown on hover on checkbox icon and label
the first click will result in a state change to "off"
an ability to change the left and right padding of the internal label for a chip
if a textfield is set to `fullwidth` and used as a select, the menuitems should be as wide as the input (and menu).
a snackbar that uses autohideduration should always hide after the specified timeout, even if the window has lost focus.
the button underline animation should shrink/re-align with size change
i want to set the value of select input 's 'type ' prop to 'text ' ( 'hidden ' by default).
<select key="input" multiple rendervalue={() => onclick={(e) => input={<input />} inputprops={{ id: this.props.id, classes: { input: classes.input }, type: "text", readonly: true }} />
i 'm attempting to add a raisedbutton to a registration form.
i 'll add a link to my repo phofcode
on providing image urls and giving them to the gridlist component, i expected that it proceeds to set everything in 2 or more columns.
tabindex should be passed as a prop and the componenet should use this passed value
positioning of the iconbutton as an inputadornment should be the same on ie11 as it is on other browsers.
expected behavior is that the button would trigger the ripple effect in order to visually tell that it has focus :-)
circularprogress animation should be smooth and predictable under load
i would prefer `chip` not handle "backspace" `keydown` events, but if this is desired functionality, being able to override the `onkeydown` event unconditionally would suffice.
material ui components should be displayed correctly in production as in dev mode.
expected like dev mode phofhyperlink
the date value assigned from the state object should populate the date picker date value as it is.
if i choose a date, this date should correctly displayed
the listitemtext component should change colour when an override is applied
i expect to have it changed in both: html in `class` attribute and inisde `<style>` tag.
i expect that when i pass a value of 20 to the circular progress component, the resulting circle would be 20% full.
i expect that when the value passed is 50, the circle would be 1/2 full, and that it would have to be 100 to appear "completely" full.
when making a <tablerow> with the selectable property set to false, the `disabled` property of the generated checkbox should be true.
with japanese character can input normally, not duplicate when having newline.
the label in the text box should be on the right side as in the example, but this is not the case.
**expected result:** capture du phofimage
navigate the material-ui 1.0 docs using internet explorer 11 (useful to check component demos, etc).
caret should position on active input field.
if the "collapse" transition has finished, the content / children should be in the final position / layout.
to reproduce you need the following composition: a collapse with an input inside, which has a iconbutton as adornment.
without iconbutton, everything works fine.
when a user sets some kind of `primary1color` or `textcolor` on the muitheme `palette` to change the color of `checkbox` while checked.
when the box is checked, the primary color should apply.
and when user unchecks `checkbox`, box-outline should revert back to it's original color.
copy and paste components and have them actually work out of the box just like bootstrap components
when using the `open` prop, the select's menu should be positioned in the same place as if it were not a controlled component and was opened via a click.
i do not use any subheader elements in my project.
bundling the project should throw no errors.
i expect that a menu item on a touch device should function approximately the same as on desktop: when a selected item is clicked (touched) the darkened background should turn white (at some point - after finishing the transitions).
this issue is similar to #8963, to which i added a comment.
if children are added to a drawer where `persistent=true`, the component will spill onto the page.
the component position should update automatically in order to stay hidden or provide the caller with the information needed resize component.
@oliviertassinari said: "the resolution should be about adding an action property slider so people can programmatically update position."
there shouldn 't be a warning when importing an svg icon.
or if there should be, please update docs to reflect the correct way of rendering the svg icon in our code.
currently the docs don 't show if any fontsize attribute needs to be passed in.
on the server : the classname generation should occur once on the client: the classname generation should occur once both classnames generation should match
when user adds a new row to multiline field it resizes it's height to fit the text and cursor moves to the new row.
the title should look like this: expected phofimage
drawer should be "at the same elevation as the content or background.".
only a temporary drawer should, as discribed, "opens temporarily above all other content until a section is selected.
when i click outside of menu, it must be dissmised.
child of `fade` should never be visible when `in={false}` on mount
whenever a flatbutton is clicked, the event handler should receive the event object of the button.
should indicate on the docs for the auto complete component that you can set the style of the floating label.
use a label tag to check a checkbox using a htmlfor prop.
according to material.io phofhyperlink snackbar should not block the floating action button.
the popover should not get shrunk on the popover exit animation
i expect the link to underline on hover.
due to the somewhat slow behavior when using controlled textfields, i 'm currently trying to use uncontrolled textfields.
my first idea was to simply use `setstate` in the onchange event handler to update the state.
basically, the code looks like this: phofcode the event handler currently looks like this make sure it 's `setstate()` which causes problem: phofcode what i expect see is that state property "test" is set value of textfield.
select set the value upon a selection
as a user who is navigating the react-router enabled site using the keyboard, i have made my way to a tabs component, and it is displaying keyboard focus properly.
to select the focused tab, i hit space bar, and react-router updates my view to the corresponding component.
two behaviors i observed, and provided fixes for: - selecting all rows then de-selecting any row, de-selected all rows.
changed so all other rows remain checked ( 9cdd915 phofhyperlink ) - selecting all rows via the body (not using select checkbox in header), would not automatically check the 'select all' checkbox when child rows were selected.
changed so 'select all' checkbox is now checked when child are selected ( phofhyperlink ).
_i'm not sure if my approach is the best way to address this, as i've added an optional parameter to `onrowselection()`, parameters are not documented (see table docs phofhyperlink )._
popover renders within the context of the anchorel document.
the popover doesn't overflow the `anchorel` parent window when being positioned.
i expect the color of my svg icon to change when hovering over it.
i was expecting that `body2` type in typography will use same element as `body1` which is a `p` element for body1.
`<select native required>` or something like `<select native selectprops={{ required: true }}>` should place the `required` field on the `<select>` dom element.
the gridlisttile should look the same when wrapped in a component as when it's not wrapped.
i should be able to edit the values of inputs inside of a modal.
some users like to use tabbing and keyboard to traverse through a page.
for checkboxes you should be able to use both check or uncheck the checkbox.
ripple effect should disappear after the modal is closed.
it should make the text in the div red and the div background blue, without any console errors.
if docs are followed css injection order should be honoured when using create-react-app
an `appbar` should offset to the right by the amount of the drawer after reopening.
components with withstyles should work with recursively.
the first line should appear as `npm install --save material-ui@next`
nextjs sample apps should run without any error.
setting these palette values should change background colors appropriately.
nextjs sample application should load without any issue.
i would like to use `textfield` like so: phofcode and i would expect the internal `input` component in the tree to have `fullwidth: true`, but this is not the case (tested with react dev tools - if i toogle this prop on `input` component under `textfield` it is properly rendered).
if i make a card which only have one element of cardcontent and nothing else (no controls, no media) then the alignment of the card should be correct.
the drawer should slide back into the hidden position
primary theme color should be used
when button is selected, it should have "selected" style, and when is not selected should have "label" style.
a selectfield with openimmediately=true should be displayed open without click.
there should be no error on the console if the property openimmediately is used on a selectfield.
specifying `label` class should not cause warning: phofcode
hi, im trying to use the updated `hidden` with `initialwidth` not sure which one of these is correct: phofcode either option gives me a warning > warning: failed prop type: invalid prop `initialwidth` of type `string` supplied to `hidden`, expected `number`.
> in hidden > warning: failed prop type: invalid prop `initialwidth` of value `100` supplied to `withwidth(hiddenjs)`, expected one of > in withwidth(hiddenjs) warning: failed type: invalid `width` type `number` supplied to `hiddenjs`, expected `string`.
in hiddenjs i dont see the property on hidden.d.ts either in
i expect when after input onchange ,that will detect the length and when bigger than zero the reducers will change to true and make the component change
simulating click on a mounted switch control should call onchange
menu's popover position after zoom is the same as in case no zoom was performed.
similar to the example presented in the demos ( phofurl adding content (children) to mui's popover should let their events to keep being registered like when using react-popper.
when focus on a textfield using tab key, the position should stay the same.
when you have a select field selected and begin to type, it should change selection to match what you typed.
orientation in stepbutton's props should be optional as document described.
text should render in a chip
one click deployment from phofurl should work.
i am added some style to make `menuitem` bit smaller, like `menuitem sizes` (not find about this property) phofcode then used phofcode
this is using almost the exact example from the documentation for the responsive drawer.
i expect the drawer to close when i either click away from drawer or make window large again.
can override `muitouchripple` in the `themeoptions` overrides section.
button should be styled according to override specified for it in createmuitheme.
as per example here phofurl
select a new value, state is updated
i should be able to pass an input styled with styled components to select const styledinput = styled(input) <select input={<styledinput />} />
no type errors would be fantastic - and this is the only one i've run into so far!
when calling dialog component with fullwidth=true and no other props i would expect the dialog to take up the full width of the screen
when using the latest beta26 under typescript, i expect to be able to leverage the changes to zindex, namely theme.zindex.drawer.
on blur event the label must be moved above the field.
sometimes the value for the 'title ' could be calculated and may be set to null.
in this instance the tooltip should not be shown.
i actually would not expect to need to provide the `textcolor` prop myself.
otherwise that should be probably mentioned in the documentation.
i just want to add the circularprogress component to my app.
get paid for the records in the table
when clicking the delete icon on chip, it only activates the onrequestdelete()
there should be an intuitive multiple select component that has the correct items selected in the popup list.
maybe it would be better to use a list with additional checkboxes in it, something like in this demo (when you click the struck through eye phofhyperlink .
an alternative would be like it is solved in this pull request phofhyperlink , but i am not sure if this is the right way, as i like how single select components behave.
that`s why i opened an own issue for multiple select components.
the application should compile without error
`<switch />` when this.props.ischecked is ** undefined ** ( on initial render), the switch is off.
when this.props.ischecked later updates to `true`, the switch should be on.
`<slide>` children prop should accept a function that passes in status and returns a react element as well as a react element like `<transition>`.
* ssr generates valid class names * client generates the same class names (assuming there's a way to configure it to do so)
i expect to select the dark theme with this code.
when page is reloaded, the render should be stable.
it is correct in the development build, i.e when i do `npm run dev` development phofimage
when moving between tabs the ink bar should slide along with the selected tab.
i have set a callback function for the onitemclick property of menu.
i expect the call back function to be executed for all nested levels of menu items upon clicking that item
the `chip` should be as narrow as its content, like it does in chrome
the multiline textarea cursor should be aligned with the text.
can call the `creategenerateclasname` as usually
to not hide overflow of body & make things shift when scrollbar disappears.
the tooltip with a title of "test title" to be shown without line breaks:
i expect it to change the color to the different hue
that the popover content will adjust to the dynamically loaded/delayed content
jss expanded syntax should affect styling in the same manner as regular styles.
i would expect that both red and blue boxes render exactly the same given that they're technically applying the same styles.
generated sizes include the type of unit, so it's not up to the interpreter to add missing information.
specifying a tabindex of -1 should make it so that the control does not receive focus when using the tab key.
`<menuitem>s` are not selectable when generated with a function or a (stateless) component.
it should toggle selection on a item after each click this happens with `multiple` option at least ** edit ** : actually the font-weight is slightly changing (400 / 500), but i believe this background should be cleared is the pointer leaves hover, i guess there's an `:active` rule that still make it with this background
keep the correct boxes checked even when the table data changes
the current error message is associated with forgetting to import a component, making troubleshooting more difficult.
i should not receive error
display the delete icon for the `<chip />` component when `ondelete` prop is provided.
there will be no warnings in console.
there will be a line with `timeout`, not with `transitionduration` here phofurl
it could also be the opportunity to make the implementation more customizable friendly.
the controlled/uncontrolled behavior is determined at the mount time.
`inputclassname` should be applied to the input element whether `inputprops` includes `inputprops` or not.
the one exception would be if the inner `inputprops` includes a `classname` prop as well.
should only call onchange once (i.e.
when the state of the panel changes).
passing loop element to menuitem onclick, the elements is always the last element in the array.
- once a `collapse` has finished animating in and has the `entered` classname, `overflow` should be set to `visible` so borders, box-shadows, `checkbox` ripples, contents positioned outside etc are visible.
i expect popover to not touch scroll events until it is actually on screen.
when a textfield is focused, only that and the one that got blurred (if any) should be repainted
click on disabled textfield in ie11 (internet explorer 11.873) not activate underline animation
i'm trying to follow the material-ui documentation, with the end goal being creating a left anchored permanent drawer which has listitem buttons that link to different pages.
dialog will scroll its own content when i make a scroll gesture on the phone
put two autocompletes above each other (or any other element below an autocomplete) and it will sit flush against the bottom
i have a `snackbarcontroller` component that i place at the root of my `router`, this is backed by a redux reducer with some actions that allow me to open the `snackbar` and pass properties to it for the message and such
opening the select box and typing one of the valid options should highlight said option and pressing enter should select it.
popover in typescript projects should be able to have anchorposition and anchorreference set.
print "ref is ok" in console.
it should compile and work
fonticon 's onclick method 's action should be able to override the hovercolor 's reset callback after the click.
i want more color contrast when using the dark theme
`<hidden mddown>` components must not be displayed when `withstyles()` returns `width: "md"`
you should be able to use a `[switch]` inside an `[expansionpanel]`
app should start without issue with mui compiling properly.
mark textfield as an error state when form validation fail
grid items have fixed max-width and are not moved to the new line
after resizing my window tooltips should be repositioned correctly to avoid unnecessary scrollbars.
text should not overlap pagination drop down
drawer ts drawerprops definitions should support using modalprops={{...}} prop in a ts project.
events should be fired only once just as on mouse click
- text color: `#ff0000` phofcode
tab indicator should dynamically resize its width when the parent container width changes
using a palette like this should not give type errors: phofcode
label text should be right aligned when `dir="rtl"`
floatinglabeltext should always be visible
when i use the tab key to navigate a page with material ui (lets say the component demos on the next site) and focuses a radio button or a checkbox they should display a circle under the control to convey that control has focus like shown in phofurl
the state of form elements should be preserved in expandable `<card/>`s.
the console.log outputs the htmlinput element
to display the same day as in the date object argument.
prefixed styling should be applied
vendor prefixes should be generated for certain style rules like `display: 'flex'` or `transform: 'translatex(100px)'`
same as with tooltip placement='bottom'
whenever i change a value in my const styles = theme => ({..}) in drawer (or anything else in the application), material-ui withstyles should not throw an error.
i expect scroll to appear only when the number of lines in a multiline text field is bigger then the defined maxrows.
i want the color and font of the text in the header row of the table to be editable in material-ui 0.19.4.
that the row height would stay consistence no matter the controls used inside
in ** chrome ** it works as expected.
:ok_hand: the text on an input field is not stripped.
when using just a couple `textfield`s and a `button` (ie.
a login page) and using the phofhyperlink module, i would expect that only the `textfield` and `button` components should be bundled in the ouput.
when i change the slider props, i believe that the slider accepts new props, updates its state and re renders properly.
working to not have errors.
i am not sure if this is possible but could there be a typescript explanation fork of docs?
just like the docs but in typescript with proper typings.
mostly configuration would be most helpful.
there should be no error
1. add a `<select>` with `<menuitem>`s inside an iframe.
2. click on the select 3. menuitem shows up in the expected location.
i expect any field to be marked as dirty if it changed from the original values.
if i loaded the page and a non-blank value was selected in the select field, and i change it to a value that equals "", it should mark the field as dirty since it changed (regardless of what value changed to, as long as is different).
setting the keepmounted property to true on a modal component should either: - ensure that the modal's children are mounted during server-side rendering, or - have no impact on server-side rendering at all because the documentation explicitly points to the keepmounted property as a means to improve seo, my expectation is that modal's children _should_ be present on ssr render.
however, for my immediate use case i don't care if children are there on ssr or not.
i just need keepmounted modals to not break ssr.
text field of this select field should not be cleared when its dropdown is opened.
i expect the tests to run without a problem.
keep different script command to run tests and another to update baseline screenshots
a dialog should appear that requires an explicit ok button
- examples should look significantly different between full-width and centered (see bootstrap phofhyperlink ) - documentation should specify which part of the code is responsible for full-width and centered
when opening a menu and creating a react portal, the portal that's created should reference the `node.ownerdocument` of the `anchorel` or something similar, to support rendering material-ui components in a new window (such as through a library like react-popout phofhyperlink )
the ripple effect should disappear, as it happens with a regular button example with `button` (expected behavior) : phofurl
select becomes focused (but not open) when focus() is triggered manually.
expect the same behavior as hitting <tab> on the preceding element.
element `div` not allowed as child of `label`.
my code is compiling, but i get an error in the console: uncaught typeerror: (0 , _styles2.default) is not a function
pass a class with styles to component and change label color
this should work without outputting this error to the console or else be suppressable
letters should not be cut off in input fields.
the `onchange` event handler of a `<textfield should receive an event object where `event.target.name` is `"xyz"`.
when dialog closes, tooltip should not appear again.
all rows should have the same border color
it should compile without errors.
that the menu animates in, vs rendering and just "popping" over the textfield.
the list should not scroll to first item when i check last or near last item.
it must stay at the same place where i clicked.
when exit a dialog, the dialog paper should disappear with the passed transition (zooms out if the transition is `grow`)
i expect no error will be thrown by typescript compiler when i assign a reactnode to the `title` property of tooltip.
i should be able to somehow use a `<listitem>` with a `link` in typescript.
the `console.log(css)` returns some css as string (?)
i would expect that spellcheck and lang props propagates down to the input or textfield elements within the respective components.
rendered expected html looks something like this(simplified): phofcode `
when using the `input` component with `multiline={true}` and `fullwidth={true}, the generated `muitextarea-root` component should have a `width` of `100%`.
i would expect this to be default allowed props
i have grid layout with multiple elements and responsive breakpoints `sm` and `xs` to display them in row on larger screens, and in column on small ones.
when i want to print my page to pdf using window.print() and a4 format, i should be able to replicate my layout
while drawer is closed, it should be possible to change it's anchor side.
should be a similar if not identical look and feel across all browsers
should be able to utilize mui 's `textfield` component w/ ssr w/o having react warn on ssr and csr render mismatches.
expect that when i type into an autocomplete field, and receive a dropdown list of items to select from, on selecting an item that the autocomplete input field would retain its focus so tabbing would move to the next field.
when i use a select field, it should "feel" responsive and fast.
currently, before the menu with all select options pops up, we wait until the mouseclick is over.
instead, at least on non-touch devices we should consider starting the opening animation as soon as the click starts (for instance mousedown event).
i would expect the modal to be closed correctly.
selecting menuitem in select component connected to redux-form sets redux-form field value to menuitem value.
in the documentation for the `select` component when using the `multi` option a check mark appears next to the selected item.
linear progress and circle progress to have a consistent api implementation (with or without 'max/min' props')
should not throw an error to a reference phofcode
i should be able to run the app after following the steps.
drawer should not show up on re-render
the menu item in select should be aligned to left
have the colors set correctly
i would expect native and non-native selects to left justify their text with the same text indent as an input.
the override should be without any error.
if i manually add the property in node_modules in the proper interface, the function handle is passed down to the html element and it works as it's supposed to.
the components should allow overriding of these events: phofurl
when using a grid that scrolls vertically, a horizontal scrollbar should not be necessary.
here's the expected behavior which is what i get on chrome.
this is after removing `minwidth: 120` from the select example: image phofimage
when setting a formcontrol to disabled the inner controls (checkbox and switch) should be disabled as well, both if they are directly inside or wrapper around a formcontrollabel.
expand and collapse smoothly like it does without grid inside
should pass theme object into the props
visiting material-ui.com on the stock/default android browser running android 5.0.2 the drawer shouldn't be stuck open.
since inline if with logical && operator ( phofurl is a popular technique to achieve conditional rendering, i think that bottomnavigation should support this, instead of throwing an error.
i think this could be achieved by filtering out children that are null at phofurl before mapping them.
floating label should only float after selecting an element from the list.
when a select is opened with a long list of items, the top of the dropdown should be visible and the dropdown should be scrollable.
when list is long in dialog, it should have vertical scroll bar in dialog.
this works well in chrome and firefox.
the input should receive the properties from the textfield even if i use the inputadornment or not.
without it, the component renders ok.
1. make change to file 2. save file 3. react hot loader renders change without erorrs and keeps state
i'd expect an input to blur when disabled is set to true if it is focused.
additionally, i'd expect the visual styling to not appear focused when the input is no longer focused.
when changing the index in state the tabs component should update the indicator.
drawer sticks to the side, provided in `anchor` property (in this case, it's 'bottom').
defining a new shadow table with changed values should override the shadows css.
phofcode should display a long textfield, as long as the "very, very, very long" option.
when overriding a style which does not exist, i would like to know _which_ style, which key respectively, does not exist.
all valid children of the table component should be rendered.
snapshot testing is possible with all components.
if i open a menu that has no item with `select={true}` i would expect the menu to open with the first item highlighted for as long as the cursor is hovering over it and then when the cursor moves to another item, first item should be un-highlighted.
so, only item that is under cursor should be highlighted if there is no selected item.
their should be a method to compensate for the dialogs bahavior when it opens.
the dialog remove the scroll bar when it opens.
when the site contains fixed elements that causes the element to move slightly.
the popover pop-up layer has animation when i focus textfield first.
clicking on the label of a checkbox, radio button or switch selects it, without activating the keyboardfocus effect.
am able to use withtheme in my react 16 application
when provide a prop with onclick in menuitem like: phofcode a exec funtion, should throw error
the documentation of checkbox and radio button components at the docs website has 'label'.
the colour should change to the applied colour from the import.
with ** 1.0.0-beta.13 ** i got this title <img width="450" alt="screen shot at 19 20 24" src=" phofurl
at mobile breakpoints, a `<snackbar />` positioned bottom-center should span the whole width of the window.
popover from onfocus should only be triggered once, similar to onclick.
popover should rendered at the position the placement logic calculates.
i would expect that when i programmatically set the value of the multiline textfield to '', the text inside it would disappear.
i expect to not see any warnings when everything is working.
change the style of the snackbar components root element
when a input or select components are inside of grid component, they should follow the layout established by the grid component.
i expect that i click away with a right click, an event is emitted, to give me the option to act.
**dialog with date picker example:** if date picker is opened and on esc clicked should close the date picker, not the dialog.
i expect the following code to generate the menu icon inside of a div: phofcode
the toolbar component should respect custom theme settings.
the drawer should stick to the right side of the screen when set with `anchor="right"` and `type="permanent"`.
i should not be getting the above warning
get the input html tag under select
phofcode should properly add a transition of `background-color`.
the circularprogress should rotate on it's axis
tooltip is visible for hover
onclick handler should only be called once.
right aligned input field in textfield
grow transition honors the enter/leave durations propagated from the dialog component.
if the entered number is deleted, it'd be better to not show the default 0 (as seen in component demos).
or show the default 0, but remove it if the first digit entered is not 0.
the tab indicator must always show the selected tab
based on the material design guidelines the label text of a button is meant to be in the center phofurl
when we wrap a button into a `tooltip`, the `tooltip` component should not interfer with the other components when the `iconbutton` is not hovered.
on mobile devices if it's possible to scroll on search result, when the user scroll the keyboard should disappear.
hmr should replace/update the `<style>` tags in `<header>`
the drawer component should apply the right border depending on which side is anchored when it is docked i.e.
the entire tooltip element should not be rendered until i hover over the tooltip activation element.
when adding text in the middle of a string the cursor should stay where i am typing.
the `dense` prop should reduce height of `<menuitem />`
expect the listitem to be.. well.. disabled?
i think there is no actual page behind the component demo's and the link should probably just open the sub navigation
we would expect the first/current item to be focussed on opening the dropdown.
have different names for the two properties so it's not clashing, and case isn't required.
select should work exactly the same inside a dialog as on a normal page.
in the render method of a component, it would be convenient to be able to use boolean operators to decide whether or not a menuitem child renders.
: `<select> <menuitem value=0 /> <menuitem value=1 /> {canbetwo && <menuitem value=2 />} </select> `
the tooltip label should be in the same fontface as the theme
hello, thanks for your time as always.
i love the new version of mui and it has been working great for a project that i am working on!
when defining a custom theme, i should be able to override and remove the shadows globally.
with the changes specified in beta v10( phofurl ) it looks like any custom theme specified shadows will be merged into the default shadow list, instead of overriding it.
if possible, there should still be a way to replace/override entire shadow array, as this was case for pre-v10 beta.
the native browser `select` element allows you to move to options by typing arbitrary characters when the select menu is open.
the newly added `select` component (which is greatly appreciated by the way!)
does not support this functionality.
when having menu items display conditionally it should work as expected.
when picking an option from `select` and then clicking outside the select container, `select` looses focus.
the framework should use ** my ** default transitions that i put on the createmuitheme function.
the popover should show a default animation when it pops in.
the label stays floated, if the user enters non numeric values to a textfield with type="number"
when you unselect some item that was previously selected, unselected item should be unhighlighted
in document buttons phofhyperlink phofcode now have changed into phofcode
when the date picker has no value, if it is going to display the expected date format in the field, it should treat that as a value and move the label up to superscript.
alternatively, don't display date format unless user enters field and there is no value.
i would expect the components to appear or disappear based on a breakpoint change.
the animation loop should be seamless, as in here: phofurl phofurl
the `classname` prop can be overridden by other tools or the user (eg.
ts should not complain if we try to use standard html properties such as title and so on.
mini variant version of the drawer should not be horizontally scrolled when collapsed
dialog shows up while the drawer slides back in the background.
the disabled color should be applied when disabled is true, no matter what the color parameter is set to
when i create an `iconbutton` with a menu that activates on mouse click, the `menu` should open **on top of** the `iconbutton` because the `iconbutton` has been set as the anchor element.
the third line of output should have been the same as the first.
bookmark b2 should have been a different bookmark and not overwritten b1.
the documentation phofhyperlink ) for createbookmark indicates > if a note book mark already exists at the address with same category, it will be replaced.
this implies that if two note bookmarks are created with different categories at the same address, both can exist.
note that documentation of getbookmarks also implies that multiple note bookmarks can exist at same address.
> returns all of note book marks defined at specified address.
if the decompiler-generated local variable is larger than the original, then the storage size should be appropriately set, so there should be no "invalid storage" message, and the new name should be reflected in decompiler pane too (instead of an autogenerated name).
ghidra is expected to import the file and proceed to disassemble.
open the defined strings window normally.
as per 9.0.4, display the full string, with no missing bytes.
ghidradev links to the installed ghidra instance
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
ghidra identifies the push-push-ret sequence as an indirect jump, ideally flagging the two memory locations as a pointer.
i 'd expect the current program 's display to update when a function is executed from a gui component just the same as when the function is executed in a script outside of a gui element.
the instructions get decompiled as vmul variants, and not as cdp instructions.
| to match the pattern if at least one of the tables match.
character sequences should be two entries long, especially if made up of pure ascii characters.
in the decompiled code, is supposed to appear after the write to `dat_io_00a1`, not right after
same as 9.0.4 and below
the cursor should be at the last position of previous running.
the function to keep its name and be added to the specified namespace.
the decompiler analyzing correctly the file
the gui labels have correct space characters between words.
the `$tss0@` should be parsed as a special name rather than as a template parameter, with the `0@` apparently being an `@` terminated, unencoded decimal index.
i don't think there's there's a canonical representation, but safe local static guard'`` seems like a reasonable choice.
the content of the clipboard should not include the encompassing `"` signs.
so just `localfree` in the example above.
this would enable easy usage of the content, for example, to rename a variable afterwards.
i expected the procedure to fix the jumptable boundaries and the decompiler to figure out there is a switch there.
i would expect a local function label to be applied in situations where there is an offset from either ebp or esp register that would fall withing the functions stack frame.
to start analyzing the binary
not sure, but i would expect the register space of the sla file to be used.
i'd expect all line weights to be displayed with an equal thickness.
ideally, all of the edges should have the thicker line weight to make them more visible.
function signature gets applied (
i would expect you to go to the actual reference address regardless of what field you select.
whenever one click on the `display function call tree` button, a new tab (or if present, switch to that tab) should be created to the current function under cursor.
i 'd expect that only the instructions where a color is applied to would display the colors
changes should be reflected in the new import
the header is parsed and added to the data type library.
the connection should establish successfully
i 'd expect that when you export the code_browser tool, all user preferences should be saved in this export
function names demangled during autoanalysis.
expected behavior is to see the correct function signature.
there is a warning about the inability to resolve "doesnotexist *", without aborting.
i would expect that if ghidra gets confused and can 't recognize the stack depth change, that upon manual updating and reanalyzing the program, ghidra would use the manual update in its calculation.
infinite cycle with ghidra stops responding
ghidra should be able to work with pdb.exe without problems.
i would expect all fields to auto-size to the minimum length needed, up to the maximum set in the "edit code blocks fields" setting, not just the last field.
i would expect all fields to expand to the size set in the "edit code block features" setting.
given the same analysis options, i would expect all library functions identified in a given version of ghidra to be identified in later versions for the same file.
it would be nice if the copy special would work on a single row in addition to an entire selection just as the normal copy does.
the struct is passed through xmm0 (and xmm1 if > 64 bits) and returned through xmm0 (and xmm1 if > 64 bits)
ideally, if the edges can be routed around all code blocks so they do not go through any existing code block regardless of the code block field sizes used.
it would also be very helpful to have the edges not overlap because it because extremely difficult to determine where the edge goes if you have overlapping lines.
i expected to be able to browse the decompiled function just like any other.
references to data at offset 0 in a segment should be marked up as any other reference.
parameters bound to registers should respect the registers ' size before being substituted in the listing view.
as in, a parameter bound to al:1 should not be applied to ax, and a parameter bound to ax:2 should not be applied either al:1 or ah:1.
import imports file and does not throw exception.
stack depth is determined by stack purge of called function.
near call is targeted at function in same overlay if possible.
header contains actual column names rather than first row.
`__return_storage_ptr__` should be placed in `x8`.
i would expect there to be no difference in behavior between manually typing in string and clicking on the predefined string option.
with the above example, the result should be unsigned_long_()::.
extended xml entities should be disabled.
the value for `b` should be 11, instead it is 2.
registers should be ordered like "x0, x1, x2, ..., x9, x10, x11, ...".
following the xdg base directory specification.
the disassembly should be a1 50 mov3q #-1,(a0)` or a1 50 mov3q #0xffffffff,(a0)`.
the decompiled code should be `*in_a0 = -1;` or `*in_a0 = 0xffffffff;`
renaming the variable not removing decompiled output.
from the operation section of load word (pc-relative) on page 104 of the mips16e application specific extension to the mips32 architecture phofhyperlink , the `base_pc` value used to compute load address should be that of preceding instruction if lw is in a jump delay slot.
for sample program, `base_pc` for lw instruction should be `0x0`, so operand `0x8(pc)` should refer to address `0x8` instead.
a result of false on failure to apply.
expected archive size to be settable or modifiable, or for some override mechanism (forcing types to use _generic_clib_64_) to properly set pointer sizes to 64-bit.
note: through the ghidra api, local/remote file and local project archives can have their pointer size 's modified.
however, an extended search for a similar operation on remote project archives did not appear fruitful (though that definitely does not rule such a mechanism out entirely).
the bytes should disassemble to "lahf" and "sahf".
ndisasm disassembles these as "lahf" and "sahf", respectively.
the bytes should disassemble to "movbe word [r15 + rax*2], cx".
the cleared/deleted component to be non existent in the child structure.
in the first case you expect (lpstr)&var_1e is correct and in the second case byte_a224 and anone_1 as is the case in the sample should have been correct output if segment was removed or segment was used for memory query respectively.
here is a demo of the attack behavior.
a prompt should have appeared allowing the user to rename the function
given a literal with a bunch of leading zeroes, could keep bumping the precision until at least one non-zero digit shows up, and then add 2-3 extra digits after that.
as another approach to the problem, in one of the past projects i pre-generated a (float literal bytes) -> (c++ literal value) lookup table for a number of `a/b` combinations that produce literals that require >7 fractional digits to represent, as well as `pi*a/b` and common bit-based ones (`1/(1<<a)`, `1/((1<<a)-1)`), which allowed to output easier-to-read literals (`(3/7)` vs in common scenarios.
the decompiler is supposed to send getexternalrefxml to get the function details for the external referenced function.
it does this consistently on 32 and 64-bit windows modules.
ghidra to display the instruction as: phofcode (24-bit addressing
the decompiler should return the cs register after a far call to the value prior to the call which is the current cs:ip pair of code being scanned.
the program counter in this case is really pair cs:ip and not merely ip which is part of problem.
due to thoroughness of architecture i have not yet pinpointed exactly how to fix this problem.
currently stack pointer is properly adjusted and fix should be in same place of scanning post-call with a properly adjusted stack pointer by properly adjusting code segment register as well.
from my understanding model, a call fixup or some sleigh code supposed be queried by decompiler which will for most part just restore cs and sp registers yet this not occurring.
the symbol without the section name prefix should be set as primary.
a reference to will be created
`e_rlwinm r11, r0, 0x2, 0x0, 0x1d` should result in the operation `r11 <- (r0 << 2) & 0xfffffff0`.
in my code this is used to calculate offsets into a jump table and the address at that offset is used for a `se_bctr` instruction later on (ie.
branching to the address in the jump table).
instead `<< 2` never happens and offsets are all wrong in decompiler.
recognizing mosd/ucomisd as a sign of the parameter being a 64-bit float, or, failing that, showing a comparison to literal 's raw floating-point value.
debugging statements should either be removed, or there should be further documentation regarding what is gated behind jad.
importing functionality should not depend on previous imports that have been performed.
all builds should work after the mentioned dependencies have been installed.
but if the "get dependencies for ghidradev" step has not been done, ghidra build fails.
ida pro successfully imports a dylib from a shared cache as if they were individual dylib files.
it correctly locates the mach-o header and processes the dylib.
the order of the function parameters should now be exactly as we specified when we moved the parameters up and down with the arrow buttons.
generate a valid sla file.
assembly language should be listed for these bytes rather than keep them as data with the question mark
expected behavior is that ghidra refactors the code properly and uses the new name in the decompiled source code.
the call is recognized as a normal call in the decompiled code.
when `ad2_2` has a value of 2 or 3, `mode_ad` should be set accordingly and match the constraints in the `rs_post` table for `mode_ad = 0x2` or `mode_ad = 0x3` (without defining extra rules with constraints for unused lower values).
to see the simplified if condition.
for the example above, i expect the following output: phofcode or phofcode
it would be nice if instead it was decompiled as: phofcode or at least indicate somehow that `bvar4` is changing as result of the call.
release com object interfaces when of no more use..
the zlib file should be correctly recognised and decompressed, or otherwise imported in its compressed form.
the zlib file should not be incorrectly recognised as a dmg file, or otherwise the failure when mounting it should be handled and other files in the archive should be imported.
the decompiler should have detected the function-local static variable and have handled it properly, should have noticed the field assignment, and should have changed into a proper memory reference.
i can copy text using a keyboard shortcut as well as a context menu.
i want to see line numbers in the output: > warn nop detected at line 1234 (sleighcompile) > warn nop detected at line 1300 (sleighcompile) > warn nop detected at line 1330 (sleighcompile) > warn nop detected at 2738 (sleighcompile) 4 constructors found
the "tip of the day"s are factually correct.
import should complete without exceptions.
( and ) to be properly handled when input as a byte string.
as calling conventions have been correctly specified for the function pointers i would expect the stack analysis to be performed correctly.
the action appears and can be bound to a key.
demangler should check for the existence of a struct with the target name in all opened databases and populate appropriately before creating an empty struct.
the enum entries should have been assigned as "invalid" = -1 (or 0xffffffff), "zero" = 0, "one" = 1, "two" = 2, "five" 5, and "six" 6. alternatively, "parse c source" should have thrown an error and aborted.
the function declaration gets parsed.
although the decompilation is technically accurate in that it accesses the proper addresses in `x`, it is much harder to read than the original c program and obscures the accesses to original struct fields.
this makes searching for references to those fields difficult if this optimization pattern appears frequently.
array dereferences in inspect should use the array in the structure.
define the function as __cdecl and not as __stdcall
the decompiler should recognize this loop.
icons should be correctly colored.
i would expect ghidra to be able to find this struct field usage correctly.
it 's especially confusing when ghidra reports zero references to a struct field that you just right clicked on to search for usages.
the standard hotkeys are expected to implement the commonly known clipboard operations in all text fields.
_dword should be parsed properly.
decompiler shows a read from volatile space (with the result discarded), followed by a sequence of volatile writes of value zero.
ghidra should not programmatically raise its windows when they become active.
(windows will raise them when the user clicks.)
decompiled code is shown as in ghidra 9.0.1
an error to be thrown if the string to be copied is larger than the stack buffer size (256).
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
equate should be shared between both view
functions) in disassembly should match output of tools run on the target like objdump; they don 't for an armv7l target, they do for an x86_64 target.
can identify the isel instruction, and can disassemble and decompile
jython internals to be cleared, reset, or all allocated memory for the faulty jython script to be freed upon exit.
make the new label the primary label
maybe `x._0_2_` and `x._2_2_` as the decompiler does?
the expected behavior is for the decompiler to produce java code
i expect the decoder to track the arm/thumb state correctly throughout analysis
the "find text" highlight should behave as in the listing window: 1. while the dialog is open, clicking in a different line should clear the highlight.
2. closing the dialog should clear highlight.
patching the instruction should produce the correct machine code instruction.
ghidra should ask if the user really wants to open a pdb file from the location embedded into the pe file.
the decompiler would register the type as `int data[]`
i would not expect this function definition to change the decompiled output of other functions to the point where we see return addresses being assigned to stack variables.
see attached "santacruz" export where a similar approach was taken and the decompiler works as expected.
the font setting is kept between restarts
a return type of uint32_t is 4 bytes, and its storage can be allocated to two 16-bit registers.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
ghidra should recognize accesses to the data segment.
the parameter type should be maintaine
the option setting is kept between restarts.
the `guardcffunctiontable` should be parsed as an array of * dword * s separated by ` x00` as shown in the second screenshot below.
disassemble to `swl $t8, 3($v0)` and to `swr $t8, ($v0)`.
in all cases the mnemonic should have the parameter being an address and use the label.
report message from pdb.exe in the exception.
i expected a scroll bar.
ghidra recognizes that this is an xml file
this error doesn't appear, and symbols are loaded normally.
the scrolling should be the same in every pane: smooth.
i expect the ghidra gui to open correctly, like on my arch system.
ghidra should start with more that 2 monitors attached.
ghidra should be able to disassemble those instructions.
ghidra should disassemble the sequence as an indirect call.
the key binding setting is kept between restarts.
number of matches should always be a non-negative integer.
when we have union in struture what is union of pointers to different structures i expect it to: - be able to pick member of union - show code in dissasembly view with actual union field and then eventually offset it.
in this case we should get something like this ` if (punit->eunittype == unittype_object) { *(d2shrinestxt
context menu appears - os: macos 10.14.3 - java: 11.0 - ghidra version: 9.0
external libraries are loaded, as the executable i 64-bit too (x86:le:64:default (2.8)
disassemble to `jr $ra` and to `jr $t9`.
expected to have a new structure added to the data types library for this project based on the variable references found in this function.
ida phofcode ghidra (press f12) phofcode
the expected behavior is: `if ( value_in_xmm1 != 0.0 ) { ... }`
for retyping `this` to work, as it seems to do with the other parameters.
also, if possible, remove the annoying message box from the step (5), which seems completely unnecessary.
windbg has no problems with this scenario.
i 'd expect that warning to not show up, and for the import to finish cleanly.
ghidra would resolve the right "cmd.exe" located into the windows system directory.
expected data at the memory region set up in step 5 to disassemble properly.
these instructions disassemble properly at the original memory location as well as the byte mapped region set up in step 3, but not at the region in step 5. the data matched what was at original location as well as byte mapped location set up in step 3. note: this was only tested with mips support.
ida phofcode ghidra (press f12) phofcode
equals must be implemented correctly to respect the preconditions of most java standard collections.
no failure, array can be recognized.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
expected similar behavior as ida giving any result including the 00 00 00 00 ones.
the variable is renamed and nothing else happens.
no error, options window opens
the xml parser should ignore external entities.
for bonus points, it should give an error/warning when they are present.
auto analysis should either skip the affected functions or at least fail gracefully instead of looping.
it should be analyzed (like all other binaries)
the decompiled view should not show me the address of the class, rather the class name itself as seen in the disassembly view.
the got entry should point to `getchr` tested with hopper, ida pro, and cutter, and all produce the expected result.
it appears that ghidra is performing the relocation on that got entry but it's doing so incorrectly.
phofcode 1e 01 00 00 00 elf32_sym [3] 00 12 1e 01 ddw 11eh st_name getchar ddw 0h st_value ddw 0h st_size 12 db 12h st_info db 0h st_other dw 0h st_shndx ``
the legend colors should correspond to the listing markers
html should not be rendered in this view.
open within confines of monitor display.
"apply" should be enabled and "ok" should save the field contents.
the exported binary should work instead of segfaulting (happens with multiple binaries that i 've tested).
to make "windows x86 pe exception handling" faster then it currently is.
i'm not sure... ida also has problems parsing some of the dwarf header information in compiled go executables, and from talking with their support team, go doesn't seem to strictly follow the dwarf specification.
i can provide a more specific, detailed example of this from another executable if you'd like.
regardless, the 'memoryaccessexception' sounds kinda like a null-pointer exception, so i figured i'd report this as a bug just in case.
it'd be awesome to have ghidra handle parsing the unusual dwarf information from go binaries, but that is more of a feature request.
neatly scaled ui screenshot from phofimage
i would expect `stoploading()` to work the same as ios where it prevents the webview from loading the new url.
use the same playground: 1. click `navigate no leak` 2. click the button on the new page - it will set the page background 3. go back -> initial page is not affected
shorthand properties like `margin` should not differ from using `margin-bottom` like it works on the web.

the styles should be applied for elements on a modal-page the same way they are working for normal pages.
the project should work using the source code for core modules.
not block and/or take 5seconds to complete.
in the provided example i should have a red background on top of the orange modal.
when setting isiconsizefixed to false to define a custom font-size for the icons, then the icons in tabstrip should look consistent through different devices and android versions, like font icons outside the tabstrip do.
and ideally, the font-size of tabstrip icons should have same relation to usual labels, as it already works on ios.
the application should be successfully ran on device
background color will change from blue to red after step 2
the order of execution should be textfield then parent
application should run successfully but instead generates the following log phofurl
working app as it does when compiling for ios.
the tabstrip should be visible without leaving and reloading the page.

to work as on ios 12 and android
above code works as expected on android but on ios it doesn 't highlight links.
for some reason, doesn 't work.

should move to third tab.
there shouldn't be white space just before the action bar when ios blue bar location is displaying.
and launch screen should display as expected image1 phofimage image2 phofimage
the button to be as big as the text.
when setting a fixed font-size for an actionitem with fontawesome-icon, it should have the same size on all devices and platforms (as it works using a static image resource).
i 'd like phofcode to behave the same as: phofcode
to keep the scroll position when navigating between the tabs.
the layout to not break on the resume.
should show the newspaper icon in regular mode, but instead shows it in solid mode.
the buttons on the tabview should not be hitting the bottom of the screen.
phofcode is called like it does when using a phofcode
the text should not get cut out, and everything should be displayed.
a basic cronometer working in background
tabstripitem title should not be clipped in any scenario.
should rotate at the value set and not fixed to a value of 2
css classes should be added both in cssclasses and classname properties

the `css calc` expression should work, in this case width should be 100% of the parent 's width minus 10px.
the comma button should enter ', ' as the decimal separator when you have your device/simulator region set to a locale that uses a comma as the decimal separator.
- start custom activity - when custom activity destroys it should fall back to previous activity and life should go on.
multiple taps does not prevent `tabcontentitem` animation to execution.
the clip-path property should work as expected
i would expect the `red` label to be `width: 25` and the `blue` label to be `width: 50%`.
what is actually happening: * `red` is `width: 50%` * `blue` is `width: auto` (or whatever is default)
i should be able to navigate after that, and those two callbacks should be called.
the text should be toggled depending on the value set by toggle function toggle: `isloggingin = !isloggingin; isloggingin);` code-behind works as expected and console.log for the two variables show their toggle values.
but the view does not reflect these changes.
tab-based navigation page should be displayed as it was working with cli version 5. i am glad about any help.
the modal view is closed during hmr
styles to be applied correctly.

the list should show person 1 of 12 but it shows person 1 of [object object].
following is how the resulting list looks: phofimage
if the worker cannot receive any messages while doing some heavy stuff, then you should be able to stop the worker calling _worker.terminate()_ from the main-thread at least.
`actionbar` styles of the _navigating_ page are not overridden.

the ns code should follow its principles and not using short imports.

it should open the dialogs regardless of what modal.

row height has to be 60px.

the app should not have to be re-installed for every change to css.
<bountysource-plugin> --- want to back this issue?
after navigating back to "page 1" using "go back to page 1 using button status bar should become red.
the same bug appears when using native android back navigation (using "back" button in navigation bar).
expect it to behave the same as it does on android.
the content outside the frame should remain intact
application should unregister the observers on dealloc.
or another generic way to know which observers where added in the worker thread and remove them.

if you try to double tap on a view with a tap gesture recognizer and a double tap gesture recognizer, the double tap event should fire and the should not.
my expectation: `m-t-5` (or `m-t-n`) should overwrite the `margin: 0` of the `.btn` class we specified.
the current solution is actually something i 'd say is incorrect - since `m-0` should overwrite `m-t-5`
remove shadow, ripple, material effects.
i was looking for the multicolumn listview demo, but it was unavailable and i had to fix the existing demo to confirm what i was getting instead.
the unit tests should continue to run.

the app to not crash.
when the keyboard is up, there should be no safe area above the keyboard.
you can not perform the action by tapping the icon directly, just click below to start the action.
the buttons should appear in two rows, each 50% tall
i would expect there to be some function which very deliberately tells the views to re-render, for sure.
the app to not crash.
when there is no selection and selection did not change, there should not be an even emitted.
this kind of strange behavior is counter intuitive and can add up to very difficult to track down performance issues when `selectedindexchange` handler has a heavy operation.
i would expect the behavior to be consistent between ios and android.
the behavior on ios makes sense because there is no point updating the ui if the user is still selecting their item.
the text "initial" and "visible/collapsed object" shows first, but should change to "changed" and collapsed after 500ms, but it takes about 30 sec before the change occurs in ios 12.1.
what guess, it should start with default welcome screen since i didn 't edit the files
it should not crash as well as set default tabselecteditemtextcolor
to get back text string with the xml file data.
--- @nickiliev commented on mon apr 15 2019 phofhyperlink @jockehaddock can you share a rest api that returns xml file on get (so i could test the issue locally)?
also, are you using the httpclient?
if possible please share a sample app or playground phofhyperlink demonstrating the issue.
--- @jockehaddock commented on mon apr 15 2019 phofhyperlink for instance if i try to consume api described here: ` phofurl by doing: `this.http.get( ' phofurl { responsetype: 'text ' }).subscribe(res => console.log(res));` i set up a simple app in playground: phofurl (not sure if its possible to link playgrounds directly) i get this error: phofcode perhaps this is a encoding issue?
--- @nickiliev commented on mon apr 15 2019 phofhyperlink @jockehaddock setting explicitly `responsetype` resolved issue for me (btw it was happening both android and ios my side).
phofcode here is working playground demo --- @jockehaddock commented mon apr 15 2019 yes for that specific resource.
im sorry, i think that something went wrong when i posted playground link because it shouldnt have been towards w3schools but rather one below.
for one below it does not work: `this.http.get( ' phofurl { responsetype: 'text ' }).subscribe(res => console.log(res));` @nickiliev even with that resource i am still able to obtain stringified xml with no hassle.
phofcode tested your last version playground and it is not working iphone 7 ios.
@nickiliev tue 16 oh my... am sorry was testing android.. will re-test ios and post results tue 16 confirming this one as bug ios (steps to reproduce use playground any ios device) wed 17 confirming bug be reproducible with core http module .
steps reproduce: use this test ios device/emulator.

the console to show "onshowingmodally".
"opens modal" and "modal closed" shows in console.

it should behave the same with and without extended unicode characters.
the ability to add and remove views should be fine.
if nativeview is undefined, perhaps an error should be thrown to help describe how/why?
same behavior under ios and android
background color should change when checked property is false (off state).
reload after changes shouldn 't crash.
application installed on physical device icon must appear on home screen, not only in search and must work when clicked.
though it appears in search "top hit" click it produces no effects.
the classname should be valid
should just build and work right.
android should have the same behavior as ios, properly clipping as specified.
an alert saying onlayoutchanged fired should appear when opening the app.
the pan should be recognized when triggered from the child view
it 's reasonable to expect that if you can add the event you should be able to raise the event from `notify`.
the `closecallback` of the `showmodaloptions` is called when you tap outside of the shown modal view in order to close it.
supposed to return the uuid of the device.
we should be able to scroll the typed text inside the textview to see the top text.
on both platforms, the "check" label should be completly visible.
setting the tabbar translucent to falls should work for any kind of setup (with actionbar/flat or no actionbar at all.)
it should work with and without safearea as well.
animations should look the same on android and ios with a given duration.
forward and back navigation between single-frame and nested-frame pages should work.
the app should be completely stopped by closing it.
based on the documentation phofhyperlink , the loadfinished event should be emitted with the error property set.
(the docs mention the error might be attached to `loadstarted` event, but i tested this, and it isn 't set there.)
on android this works as expected - `loadfinished` event is emitted with an error set, so this seems to be an issue with ios implementation.
forward and back navigation between single-frame and nested-frame pages should work.
modal's should never cause race condition issues with android fragments and in the event they do, the framework should gracefully handle by doing what is necessary to not cause an error and allow app to proceed normally.
$parents['listview'] or $parents['repeater'] should work fine even when used as conditional operations:
the tabview height should adjust so that the tabs are not pushed past the bottom of the screen
the app should behave exactly as resuming via "recent apps tab"
long segmented bar title are centered just like in tabview.
--- @tsonevn commented on fri mar 01 2019 phofhyperlink hi @seveneye, setting up the text alignment on the segmentedbar is not supported.
regarding that, i will mark this issue as a feature request.
for now, i would suggest keeping track on the issue for further info.

app should not crash with nested frame navigation scenarios with flip transition.
password placeholder should be 'password ', instead displays 'email ' fixes: phofurl
password placeholder should be 'password ', instead displays 'email '
there should be no space between the actionbar and the tabview content.
hitting the `change tab via ngmodel` button should change the tab, but not show the slide animation.
this should truncate all 3 labels and displays all of them.
it works on android, but on ios labels are not truncated and in this case we only see the first one.
javascript files should update when making changes to a typescript file.
furthermore, if there is an issue with the project which is stopping the javascript from being generated, then an error message should be displayed.
when tapping "next" on keyboard, the page should be scrolled to the next textfield, so that it is visible (if there is a scrollview on the page).
if that is not possible only by setting _returnkeytype="next"_ for some reason, then it should scroll at least when calling manually.
the background image should render the same on both android and ios properly.
release apk should not able to access data/data folder
the green rectangle must not be cropped when there is a line break of the blue label.
per the docs here phofhyperlink you should be able to simply create an element and add a class to it with classname
with a basic list, like as follows: phofcode there should be a way to register if the user taps on a category header (here, a country).
on android, the elements of the page will be shifted upward as expected.
on ios, they will not.
webview should have ios property.
there should be a border with a width of 2, in the color white, that effectively turns the image into a circle.

the grouping should work as indicated in the documentation.
a useful error should be presented to allow user to investigate the cause of the error instead of having to guess.
the error should indicate that arrays are not supported or should allow the converter to handle the array.
running from playground the vue hello world works correctly
it should install android avds.
an error should be present or the app should load, as no code has been written yet.
the label should be at the right position and readable and the stacklayout should have a border-radius.
you should not be able to scroll on ios too.
page one should have "this data is fetched from the web, and the page is 1", and page 2 should have "this data is fetched from the web, and the page is 2".
but both says "and page 2"
hmr works correctly and not restart app.
as this tutorial shows how to create a new angular web and mobile application template i would assume that web, android, and ios will all build out of the box.
normal behavior like in other os 's
with `tns preview` it works well, so its related to webpack.
working hot module replacement i 've added the script phofhyperlink on main.ts and have "0.17.0" installed.
any help would be very appreciated.
debugging with console.log works after changes within a page.
on left and right side, the yellow view should be only 1px high in difference
opening the modal as it does before updating .
it should start the text from the right side like the first line not the left side .
expect compile and all new features works.
setting to `false` should prevent scroll on android.
both platforms behave the same.
as in previous versions, it used to work perfect.
currently upgrading my app from 3.4.0 to latest version and faced this issue.
works perfect even with upgrade on androi
it 's hiding the items below the header item, but all the items below, even the ones that were not set to visibilty="collapsed".
please see .gif for behavior.
this is working fine on android, just not on ios.
it seems like momentarily its doing right thing, but then it hides everything under, which is not what i want.
i want it to just hide items under tapped header.
i 've also tried using refresh() method of listview, same result in terms of behavior.
the unit tests run successfully
users should not be able to interact with search boxes, just like `<textfield />` and `<button />`.
however, setting these properties to false has no effect.
button text should keep the assigned text-align property.
the tabview's state should be maintained as it is.
keyboard should open and allow me to type
a white blank page without any actionbar.
the three labels should be in the left, center and right in the stacklayout with horizontal orientation.
the plugin makes a copy of the video to the application folder, should return the result of this operation and give video data

the app should start with no error.
the scroll should be disabled * react native for web (version): "0.11.0", * react (version): "16.8.6" * browser: chrome i read the code at phofurl there is a comment phofcode will the prop scrollenabled work on chrome?
or we have to do some workaround
i would expect the correct `aria-*` to be added.
in this case, it should be `aria-selected="true"`.
input `autocomplete` in browser same as `autocomplete` inside code.
but insted if setted to "off", inside browser equals "noop".
because of code inside phofcode * react native for web (version): 0.11.7 * react (version): 16.9.0 * browser: chrome
it should build the production app successfully.
rnweb works with latest react.
it should alert with text "test"
textinput should only pass numbers, not letters.
a hot updating server bundle including rnw code should work.
draggable is true by default
the expected behavior is the server to properly deliver the page css
should work the same for `click` as for `touch`, aka both tests should pass
i expect the button that 's produced to respond to a click event.
the library is incredibly simple right now where it 'll console.log a clicked event when clicked.
if you focus the button and hit spacebar, it 'll work properly.
only numbers allowed in numeric-pad
oncontentsizechange should also be fired when the size decreased, as it happens in other platforms
should throw an error "share is not supported in this browser"
i expect that the `numberoflines` prop will work independent of other components added aside.
this works perfectly on native (expo: link phofhyperlink )
filters should come back with the same id on every request.
i expect the dom element's children to be replaced, not appended.
as it does in dev.
work reliably even with pinch to zoom
it should open a google-maps
i imagine there should be an image displayed visibly.
the same behavior as on rn: only the `text`'s `onpress` callback is called.
`oncontentsizechange` is called again with the correct values
`ellipsizemode = "clip"` generates `text-overflow: clip`, for example, and not `text-overflow: ellipsis` ...
6. the locationx and y coordinates are relative to the view where the pan responder was attached
it is not supported by react native (rn does not fire onkeypress on arrow) but it would be great if the cursor did not change position.
for this, the nativeevent should not be overriden as it is done in _handlekeypress (l. 367 in phofurl i tried a little hack which does the trick: replacing the native event by: phofcode
a solid border should appear like in react-native: phofurl
support some declarative way to set the web title popover on any component, without using setnativeprops.
it 's something i 'd like to have on the web project, on mobile i did using onlongpress.
css rules should be the same and work across major browsers
the underline color should match the color specified in the `textdecorationcolor` style.
there is no warning message.
`*.native.js` should be ignored altogether
rendering in edge should match other browsers.
offscreen elements will be removed from the dom.
like in `react-window` phofhyperlink .
for "export * from \'react-native \'" to work with react-native-web
styling a view using styled-components and react-native-web works without crashes/build errors.
all styles should be included in the css output.
webpack should be able to shake out any unused modules.
slider for instance is unimplemented but because it has a designated path, extra libraries are removed.
there are no errors and storybook displays correctly.
prop should be passed as an attribute to the dom like it does in react.
size of parent containers should be auto-calculated based on content size
i 'd expect the object spread values to be applied to the view in the same way it does on ios and android.
if you remove the `inverted` prop, you get the expected behavior.
`inverted` should just make the items of the list to be displayed from bottom to top and `onendreached` to be called when reaching top.
run the app on the browser
the logged ref should not be null
same displaying result on both platforms.
application does not crash and a navigator is displayed
the scrollview should scroll horizontally
hope to look for a solution, and improve the scroll performance
nested scrollview should not affect outside scrollview!
i think `pan-x/pan-y` should be removed at this point.
no warnings from the browser.

unhandled promise exceptions should not be thrown.
there's a few possible solutions: 1) do not use .decode for svgs i'm not entirely sure what decoding means for an svg, but since some browsers support it, there might be a purpose to supporting it in rnw.
we could more specifically target svgs and safari as well, but that gets a little crufty and non-progressive.
2) add a decode failure handler if we go this route.
decide if this should call onload or onerror, it's not immediately clear which is correct (technically on ios the image still loads and displays).
although according to the spec linked below, failure of decode seems to suggest the image didn't load.
either of these solutions should fix the problem.
happy to discuss further see which is most appropriate.
still need work on some code locally test this in our codebase as bug seems be ios only.
a sandbox successfully loaded at glitch.com
the "critical" styles for the page are rendered by the server.

make the columnwrapper a direct child of the list container (not sure if this is the correct solution) or maybe be able to style the wrapper of columnwrapper?

i frankly expected it to prefix it and apply it correctly on all browsers, as that is what the documentation suggests.
the text is completely cleared to the default state (i.e.
with the placeholder), and the input is focused,
the function is called when the <view>'s <div> is clicked
the `red` box should have attribute
the view needs to be focussed programmatically similar to how it does when going through components using the tab key.

happy and successful one liner install
the release_channel in should be `stable
the old version of netdata should die and the new version should start when cron runs ** netdata-updater *
by using a tagged netdata version, i am expecting to receive update warnings only when a new stable release is out.
otherwise, the exclamation mark becomes rather useless.
it becomes tempting to ignore it completely, knowing that it is there pretty much all the time.
how difficult would it be to fix this _update check_ behavior?
installation phase exists with code 0, which means success
new metrics should never stop being collected, old dirty buffers should be dropped in favour of continuous data collection
all makefile.am files should use tabs for indentation of recipe lines and 4 spaces for indentation of non-recipe line
the netdata process should be terminated.
after some testing with @knatsakis - there is no `/proc` file-system by default in freebsd.
the uninstaller is being very careful about terminating processes.
after the pid-file is read the `/proc/<pid>/stat` is checked to ensure it really a netdata instance that running.
on freebsd we have no pid-file created at run-time, and the proc filesystem not accessible so no process killed.
a possible solution to add a fall-back that detects this situation and asks for user confirmation to run `killall netdata`
no error 421 messages should be seen as the irc plugin is sending notifications correctly
streaming nodes will be shown, as they are in safari and chrome

the reinstall_command should contain all the options that where passed to the initial installer (esp.
the netdata-updater.sh script should remain under /etc/cron.daily.
(it must use the reinstall_command variable from .environment
an update should only occur if there is a newer version available
those lines are filtered and netdata don 't fail.
netdata sends load average metrics every five second
travis builds should include the options for warnings from above.
the travis build output for a pr should produce this warning.
the nightly build should be free from warnings (change the `%d` to a `%u` to test the change).
the docs for debugging netdata should be consistent with the travis environment (check that we document these cflags).
do not fail to run edit-config if netdata is installed into a folder which is a symlink.
similar issue is phofurl the solution there was to move netdata to a different directory, but in my situation this is not desired and it the default directory that netdata uses.
i don 't even understand why netdata (edit-config) needs to check about the config files stored under a symlinked path - why would that be an issue
netdata should either be configured or should automatically detect the "real" path under which it is being accessed and use that one to register and contact its nodes.
nvidia-smi process should not be running.
all metrics as from `/api/v1/allmetrics` be present in opentsdb
several docker container running on the same docker instance should be monitored.
running netdata binary on the host works fine.
i referred to few other posts in the issues (#6293, #5861, #3972) but none of them solves this.
tried all the 3 methods from documentation but couldnt get it working.
like nginx, php, and redis, there should be a chart on the dashboard.
the old data should either be dropped (easiest, but destructive) because it's not valid with the new units, or it should be properly scaled to the new units (not sure if this is feasible).
netdata should be able to use all available resources
the quotes should be dropped from the shell strings: to run apps.plugin with escalated capabilities: sudo chown root:amoss sudo chmod 0750 sudo setcap or, to run apps.plugin as root: sudo chown root:amoss chmod 4750

nonexistent variable in expression always evaluates to `nan`
it is expected that the url redirects to the host in netdata directly
the `netdata` user and group are not removed by the uninstall process.
--- fedora's packaging guide has some good info on why this is bad practice here phofhyperlink .
quoting the relevant part: > **do not remove users or groups** we never remove users or groups created by packages.
there's no sane way to check if files owned by those users/groups are left behind (and even if there would, what would we do with them?)
and leaving those behind with ownerships pointing to now nonexistent users/groups may result in security issues when a semantically unrelated user/group is created later and reuses the uid/gid.
also, in some setups deleting the user/group might not be possible or/nor desirable (eg.
when using a shared, remote user/group database).
cleanup of unused users/groups is left to system administrators to take care of if they so desire.
adding this, you have no way know that user or group you're removing is same one which you added, and orphaned files are likely cause confusion for users in addition potential security issues.
we try deal with orphaned files issue, but we can't be sure we got everything, so it's still a potential risk, we quite simply can't deal with any of other issues properly

the configure script correctly detects that openssl is installed.
---- originally came up as part of working on #5979, which is functionally dependent on this being fixed.
i'm fairly certain something is going wrong internally in the configure script, as openssl is part of the base install on gentoo and fully installed on all of the systems i've checked this on.
gentoo does not have separate development versions of packages, it just installs all the headers alongside any given library.

streaming works perfectly, i can see "slave" dashboards directly on master , but the registry database/system/feature is not working (registry.db is empty).
worse, tcpdump on master (capturing port 9998) does not show any package after slave netdata restart (a subsequent telnet x.x.x.x 9998 works, so no firewall/network problem).
the private registry does not work nor in dashboard (hello is ok, but subsequent actions give 403 forbidden), but this later ... also a strange thing: phofurl requires also dashboard access on that port (only "hello" action, as seen in sources), not only registry access.
in order to understand exactly how the registry works (beside debugging in the sources) can anyone explain which sends what to whom ?

the smartd_log plugin should work when properly configured as documented.
we guess the master netdata supposed to update the list of the metrics after restarting the slave.
and since it used no database it does not have affect its cleaning.
the outputs of the above commands are different: inside the container nothing appear, on the host the mount appear.
the docker-compose file is correctly configured with `/proc:/host/proc:ro` directive and container user is set with `grep docker /etc/group | cut -d ': ' -f 3`
- ip:port pair should be properly formatted as `[ip]:port` when address is ipv
versions are using `git describe` format, which is the following: for example commit phofurl would be looking like this: phofcode `git describe` is robust enough not to include part when current commit is a tagged commit
match the files that haven't been modified to the stock files.
the tcp connection should be close cleanly on connection error, and fall back to other ip in case of network issue, now the connection between server is fine, but it periodically lost data on some server.
the charts appear to be accurate, so if the error isn 't actually an error, update the plugin to remove the error messages.
all ownership and permissions are equal comparing git-installation with build
like on 1.10, after journalbeat restart chart must show real number
run of netdata-installer.sh should not output `no stash found.`, and no email should be sent on an otherwise successful updater run
no error is logged as this discrepancy is to be expected in a virtualized environment
don 't show any alarms if containers are restarted normally

i expect the free memory to be displayed as-is, not in the 'inactive' memory category.
this results in a constant warning of memory used by 95%+

i 've expected netdata to update the names of docker containers in the ui when they get renamed, however this does not happen even after hours of waiting.
looks like netdata caches the name of a container immediately at its creation and does not check again for it.
here is what makes me rename the containers: i 've got ci/cd pipelines, which update dockerized microservices on a vm with netdata.
a typical script first creates a container named `${microservice}--new`, then waits for container to become healthy and if this has happened within 30 seconds, deletes old `${microservice}` container and renames `${microservice}--new` to `${microservice}`.
if healthy state is not reached, new gets killed and pipeline is marked as failed.
here 's a simplified example of what pipeline does: phofcode despite that new has this `--new` suffix for only up to 30 seconds, suffix preserves in netdata 's ui until i restart or update tool.
watching charts during deploy is not necessary c it looks like netdata collects metadata on their creation regardless that.
caching names understandable, but it 'd be still great if they had some ttl eventually got updated.
thank you so much for netdata folks!
i 'm excited about all these changes you 've started making recently
i expect the metrics to be identified with docker container name, not id.
the process should complete successfully with an up-to-date netdata instance running
some kind of better error message, that tells you what the problem is, instead of sending one down the wrong rabbit hole (i was sure it was a network problem until i attached gdb
the rpmspec results in a usable rpm package
the system editor should be use
i believe the correct implementation of incremental algorithm should drop the value if it's not monolithically increase (current value < previous value) and re-count on next data point.
dimensions show up as disk names, not `nan`
`python.d.plugin` modules are able to use python modules that are installed only for the user which netdata runs as.
--------------- this came up while trying to test #4008. the yoctopuce python modules are not included in almost any distribution's package repositories, and gentoo (the distribution i do most of my work on) does not let you install packages with `pip` system-wide (the reasons for this are related to how gentoo handles multiple python versions on the same system, but somewhat complicated and irrelevant to this bug report), so i just went and installed the modules as the `netdata` user.
after doing so, i was rather surprised get an error message indicating module couldn't be found.
it's pretty obvious this has something do with how we're manipulating `sys.path` preferentially use our independent of system python infrastructure, but i haven't dug any further into things than that yet
i expect the docker container to at least stop when the process fails.
netdata does not stat the excluded mountpoints.
i should be able to control netdata service with systemctl commands

it should work as when trying to bundle the same file from the cli
i 'm not exactly sure.
i was expecting * one * of the index.js files to compile to a version where only the required polyfills was included, to polyfill the array.prototype.from and array.includes methods for ie 11: * *
the packages should not auto install, and my files in my local directories should be used
i expect the code to be bundled.
since included files are merged into the asset, changes made to them should probably invalidate the asset cache and trigger rebuilds.
should merge the content of `data` together with the content of the imported file.

the "/demos" in the rel canonical should be ignored.
it should install `parcel` globally
what i literally expected was that parcel would bork if a dependency was missing.
that aside, it should notice my `package-lock.json` and use npm - but really the functionality should either not exist at all or be opt-in.
i feel that at the very least, automatically downloading executable stuff off the internet and installing it into your project should come with a giant warning on page 1 of the docs.
a user could have watch task running on a hidden console e.g.
in an ide, make a typo in an import and hit save, and not even be aware that their _bundler_ has downloaded random package executed post install script.
i would expect the file to end up in the `static/` directory.
according to the examples ( google developers web app manifest phofhyperlink , mdn web manifest phofhyperlink ) for the manifest of a pwa, "icons" file paths should include paths to files.
albeit, this is different from browser extensions manifests ( mdn extension manifest docs phofhyperlink )

both in development and production mode: <img src=" phofurl width="250" />
works (or at least show some progress)
parcel should compile the files as-is
after a 404 error is thrown, the error boundary phofhyperlink we placed around our routes should catch this and other app functionality should still work.
navigating to another page for example.
the `serve` mode should use the same output path as the `watch` mode, which are specified in the `main`, `module` and `browser` `package.json` properties.
tree shake should run without an error
it should only rebuild and reload when i save a file.
there obviously shouldn't be vulnerabilities!
nothing spectacular, requirejs should be imported
do not transform unicode, preserve them.
styles are on all pages
in a perfect world parcel should detect that both assets are equal and could just include one in the bundle.
but i can imagine that this might have side effects.
i would be fine if the build would not fail.
a warning would be nice as well as i was not aware that i have duplicate files in my bundle before running parcel 2.

build should produce css and js file in `dist` directory.
parcel should finish the build all the time, or fail all the time.

path to asset in img tag should be
after you call `yarn build` in the output directory `dist` there is the file the content of the file should be: phofcode the bundle resulting from the file `subdir1/subdirpage.js` is which currently is located in root dist folder.
the file `subdirpage2.html` is located in same folder as `subdirpage.html` relative link should reflect this fact.
when changing `src/app.jsx`, a new `dist/app.<hash>.js`is generated.
the contents of `dist/src.<hash>.js` changes (it includes the newly generated app.<hash>.js), so i would expect its hash to change as well.

building without it as well.
the app should deploy to heroku and run the correct start script.

the script source should be changed to match the output asset filename something like `index.client.xxxxx.js`
/dist/js/index.js (bundle) the relevant part of the bundle: phofcode if the bundled version of src/js/index.ts would look as in the example above, it would be perfectly possible to add a breakpoint inside of the source-map at `var firstname` and debug `sayhello`.
i expected parcel's module system to attempt to fetch the bundle with the value of `--public-url` as a prefix to the name of the bundle file.
sass imports should work with absolute path-style module resolution.
the build should be consistent across different types of systems and environments.
consistently working not freezing hopefully.
i expect that the code sample below works the same whether it 's loaded by the browser via `file:///`, or by `parcel index.html`.
the sample simply loads jquery via `script src` in the html and logs `$`.
generate code without the `sub` function.
`import livescript from 'livescript '` should work
given the following directory structure: phofcode full content of `example.scss`: phofcode `image.png` is arbitrary and `index.js` is empty.
running `parcel build src/css/example.scss src/js/index.js` from the top-level `project/` directory results in a `dist/` directory with the following contents: phofcode that 's fine, but `dist/css/example.css` ** should ** contain a valid `url(...)` reference: phofcode

project to build without errors.
builds in a few seconds.
bundles should load correctly, including in ie 11.
no source maps to be generated
this is expected because that repo includes the source maps, but not the actual source.
is there, however, a way for me to turn off source-map-loading for that module?
running the result in `node` reads the file correctly.
i would expect that to find the 'parcel-plugin-*' you would try to consider the package.json in the parent directories as well.
two javascript files are built, one for the app and another for the register page/route
expected parcel to serve `home.html` and `about.html` individually as per documentation phofhyperlink .

when file a is saved, parcel reloads.
it should compile my react code.
&& current behavior so expectedly, according to what parcel says phofhyperlink , it 's gotta process css codes to transform them.
but it just doesn 't.
here 's what i did to test this: 1. i installed `autoprefixer` and `postcss-modules`: phofcode and set config with `postcss.config.js` 2. i wrote `app.sass`: phofcode and i know it 's gotta be transformed to: phofcode this when run `parcel`.
3. and obviosuly made `app.js` phofcode 4. ran `parcel client/index.html` 5. checked the css bundle inside `dist` folder and it was still: which is obviously not transformed.
this works fine if i have no style=
i am expecting alias to work with `--target` either set to `node` or `electron`
with parcel 1.9.7 the output is: phofcode where `_extends3` is defined at the beginning of the module, meaning that the code runs fine.

my css `paintworklet` should be loaded and applied in my `app.js` file (see below).
the filename should be mapped to something different.
this is what the output for my css module after a `parcel build ...` should look like: phofcode
preferably to ignore the symlink, at the very least error and die.
if this is a problem with a dependancy - handling errors better so not to cause 100% cpu.
when running `parcel index.html`, it should resolve the absolute paths and run the app.
since my `baseurl` is set to `src` in tsconfig.json, then it should resolve the path as `src/config/firebase`

in css i write and i also want import the image in js, so i write `import logo from './assets/logo.png'` but parcel log `cannot find module 'assets/logo.png'` if i delete that css code , it can work correctly think the css background cause this bug so how can get the logo.png file hash name in js when used it in css aleady?
need to konw the final hash file name js, any help?

in a compiled bundle targeting the browser, `console.log(global);` should behave the same as `console.log(window);`
page reloads after each change.
a statically analyzable `fs.readfilesync` statement should inline the file in the bundle, both in `.js` and `.ts` files.
code splitting bundles is loaded when invoking(dynamic import)
the application should keep running and watch the source files for changes.
should run the code fine
tests complete without error and test runner terminates.
i guess if process isn 't defined, define it.
i don 't know where this code is generated, but it 's literally the first line of my code for the worker, and i can 't get it running.
either the initial build fails (bad import) or hmr is triggered on save.
`parcel` should run a web server i can access.
running `parcel` should disable the spinner in environments where it is unsupported.
parcel should compile the bundle using the local worker in the worker farm.
it should build and show the preview in the browser.
the path to the `babel-plugin.js` should be resolved relative to the babelrc.
parcel should find calls to and resolve the given path correctly to a public http url accessible by the browser.
bundle should not be minimized
i expect the dist folder to be updated when i change a source file.
while running `serve`, when modifying the styles within the `<style>` block in a vue template, those styles should immediately be reflected in what the parcel server outputs.
to resolve this issue, i installed `events@3.0.0` explicitly with npm, hoping it would use that one, over the outdated version it used out-of-the-box.
it should show the image in the web page just like in production mode.
work without exception in console
ideally, when you are dealing with absolute paths, parcel should understand this and if an import matches an `alias`, parcel should ignore installing it as a dep and move on.
the project should build, and the import should contain an array with the file names
it should leave my dependencies alone.
- parcel bundles the project, serves it at `localhost:1234` - when you open it in a browser, it prints "it works" and the contents of `nanocomponent`.
when i call a function in html that is defined in an imported file, i should run that function
parcel treats compiled linked modules the same as downloaded modules.
parcel supports parsing jsx with properties using typescript, with zero config.
package builds and works with
correctly import `"somepackge/some.sass"` correctly import
browser opens empty page (or with content like with `node`)
using phofurl to compare diffs.
i should get two different output since one is tailored for commonjs while the other one is for es modules.
the bundle should include instead (which does nothing and has no dependencies).
saved changes should cause the dev server to refresh
the page should render the error output from the `queryrenderer`.
code in vendor.js should be extract to a separate file
a friendly error message ("parcel requires a package.json in order to build.")
parcel shall either - include proper polyfills when needed by `fs.readfilesync()` or - leave the missing dependency unresolved
i expect the application to compile and run correctly.
sample code below should run without error, as it does without scope hoisting enabled.
compile and include css file
it should build and have no issues as when i use parcel build without the tree shaking flag.
there should be no errors writing to the cache, here is vuetify without a la carte: phofcode
parcel works out of the box because it's amazing
should bundle fine as it did in 1.8.1
i expected the project to bundle just fine like it did in version 1.8.1
/src/index.js phofhyperlink is able to resolve /src/app.js phofhyperlink .
when running `parcel build` the html output should include svg code with the `viewbox` attribute.
it should start a local development server with hot reload enabled.
the file should be successfully imported on both js and css
script tag content is bundled the same way that external scripts are bundled and bundled project functions.
the vue template should work seamlessly, like everything else in parcel :smiley:
the `h` function import should be included in the bundled code.
included file should expose the instance/object correctly.
| software | version(s) | | ---------------- ---------- parcel 1.7.1 node 8.0.0 yarn 0.21.3 operating system ubuntu xenial
if the contents of a generated javascript file change in any significant way, so should the hash in its filename.
parcel should to rebuild bundle when i save file.
when i change the `--public-url` option, so that the `sourcemapurl` at the bottom of my js file changes, i should see the fingerprint of file change... for example, i added `--public-url /dist` to my build command, so that my js files end like `//# the filename should change now, as contents of file have changed.
when i add `--no-source-maps` to my build command, should see fingerprint of file change...
tracking my files for changes and updating the bundle.css
parcel should successfully build my app: ` built in 7.70s.`
it should just load the image.
it should be able to compile
it should generate `dist/about/index.html`, and clicking the "about" link should go to ` phofurl -- which should serve the content from `about/index.html`.
parcel should be able to load @material mixins in `node_modules/@material`
i would expect the linked file to be parsed and loaded.
resulting in `won't print` appearing in the console.
uglify custom config should come into force all code.
there should be no errors in the browser console.
editing and saving a scss partial (dependency) should trigger a rebuild and update the development server.
if we write super simple code with es module like below, phofcode phofcode i hope it is bundled properly and get "hello parcel" in console without error.
there should be no errors writing to the cache, here is vuetify without a la carte: phofcode
- dist - image.bc08a89a.png - subfolder - page.html ** page.html: ** phofcode
all of the components should be displayed.
in my example code, i expect `a b c d` to be displayed in the ui.
when restarting parcel, specified pragma for jsx files should be used.
whenever a dynamically imported file is changed the main js hash should update on build.
source map should be present
parcel should hot-reload the css module with updated file.
i should be able to call functions from inside a `<script>` tag.
in other words, the code sample below should print > js foobar > html foobar
when accessing `localhost:1234/`, "hello world!"
when the file changes, so should its generated filename.
otherwise i can 't safely set maximum caching on those files safely!
when building on mac / linux previously it just included the .css file and fonts worked in both directories.
when building with parcel 1.7.1, a correct build appears: phofcode
when building phofurl using the command `parcel build index.html --public-url=./ --out-file=index.html` and uploading to phofurl the app should work as expected (when it does work locally in dev mode.)
below shows a screenshot of the expected behavior: image phofimage
classes from the imported node modules are hashed by css modules being turned on in single app level `.postcssrc` file.
this works in webpack using `less` and `less-loader`.
the build process should complete without any error.
bundling html that includes .ts files should fail when the typescript files fail compilation due to type checks failing.
from build to build, the filename should not change unless the content of the file changes.
the footer file should be transformed correctly.
parcel should parse vue.js template `<style lang="sass">` as sass
parcel should find calls to and resolve the given path correctly to a public http url accessible by the browser.
i expect that requiring a data file (json or csv or anything) should at least be consistent, so not loading the object in one case, and returning a path in another case.
but my preference would be to return a path to a data file always, so that it will allow me to choose if i would want to load it synchronously or asynchronously, or anything i want.
should work with production built or without hmr (`parcel serve --no-hmr`) the same as with hmr built.
correctly shows all the assets size.
a map should be rendered.
`style.less` should be loaded from `index.vue`.
relative paths to build assets
links to resources inside `<object data="">` tag should be resolved just like `<img src="">`
i expect to get control about the generated output format of my bundle.
in case of bundling webcomponents, es6 with `class` syntax would be a requirement.
basically i 'd just like to have my `src/` directory as the root directory of my project and be able to use absolute paths that would originate from this root directory.
in this case, using `/images/room.png` in the img tag should look for the image file at `src/images/room.png` since `src/` is the root path.
npm modules that use scss should work.
changing any .re file that is used in the project triggers a rebuild.
i can import the rust function which calls the native c code as simple as: phofcode
* parcel should successfully build test suite
i have empty html without any external resources (such as local css files or js).
when i change it and save i should get an immediate update in the browser without refresh while in dev mode.
both development and production builds logging an object with prefixed css class.
editing `src/index.html` should result in a new build getting kicked off while running `parcel src/index.html`.
since parcel is all about performance, suggesting the most performant way to load in js can help
the window object should be available as "this" to scripts imported via the script tag.
class properties should be transpiled by `babel-preset-stage-0` and the app should build
css class name available in js.
i didn 't expect any error messages.
changing `app.styl` should update styles properly.
i would expect that after adding the new configuration, the build would start using it immediately, without having to set `--no-cache`.
i expected the code from `shared.js` to end up duplicated in each web worker 's .js bundle.
when upgrading/downgrading a package the cache should invalidate all the data related to this package.
url in `srcset` will be generate, and put pictures in `dist` folder
`parcel build` should function properly and not return an error.
* node_modules should be also checked when looking for a file
using an organization package does the same thing as a normal package
it should respect compiler options in `tsconfig.json` if `{ allowjs: true }` and allow transpiling `.js` files using the ts compiler instead of babel.
if `jsconfig.json` file is found, it should transpile `.js` files using the typescript compiler instead of trying to use babel.
i have a main.css like the below: phofcode i expect after `parcel build`, it becomes: phofcode
well, by the description of the problem, it should be supported, i would think!
`parcel index.html` should output a bundled file named `{hash}.js`.
i expect images to work using the inline style background image even if the url is local
i don't know what i expect!
it would be helpful to run two parallel instances of parcel at the same time, one for library building and one for consuming the library and doing `jasmine` tests.
changing a `scss` file with css modules enabled that is "named-imported" (`import s from './style.scss '`) in js and used in `classname` by `preact`/`react`/etc should update the js that requires it providing the new `classname` variable to it, without needing a manual full page reload.
parcel.js should not bundle the `electron` package.
using bundler middleware with express server should serve the bundled file on request.
new target should appear in endpoints list.
normally it should be able to pull the new image, no matter if it 's a manager node or a worker node.
the container should run until the container is deliberately stopped or restarted
portained endpoints will be accesible in order to show all my running images, volumesc, etc
the user should have abilities associated to the standard user role, as this is expected to take precedence.
the container should deploy with the selected repository.
i expect all agents to connect to eachother irregardless of architecture.
there should be no errors reported by swaggerhub.
a stack restricted to a user should not show as restricted to administrators for rbac users.
removing a service related to a stack as an rbac user should not hide the stack for rbac users.
total control stacks should should show as total control stacks for rbac users, regardless of ownership.
if an endpoint admin or standard rbac user is trying to use the attach functionality they should be able to successfully attach.
endpoint admins should be able to manage restricted resources.
disabling rbac should switch non-admins back to standard users.
after deleting the stack the first time, everything is gone, optionally if i trigger a delete the next time and the compose file is already gone, also remove stack from database.
refreshing the browser should not cause the user to lose abilities.
udate from 1.22.1 to 1.22.2 without errors.
new, private window in firefox shows the right version.
on container re-creating/edit, health checks settings (such as commands, interval, etc) are updated if they're updated in the container image.
stacks endpoint should return the same information that is shown in the web ui, i.e.
the users who have been granted via rbac can access endpoints properly
a non-admin should be able to create and start a container with no issues.
i should be able to login.
when a team is deleted that a user is a part of, the user's permissions should be updated to remove the inherited ones.
see the logs and container stats based on given permissions.
after oauth login, end up at ` phofurl
i'd expect a way to specify which tls versions and which cyphers are enabled.
git should use the configured proxy to successfully complete the deployment.
portainer can be updated automatically by watchtower without deleting critical system files in the process.
home screen showing summary with container quantity should reflect hidden containers and decrease the number.
i would expect that by using `--force-recreate`, no old data is reused.
the workaround to the problem is to additionally provide `--renew-anon-volumes` flag to the `docker-compose up --force-recreate` command but i have a feeling portainer should not require this flag to be used.
i think such behavior is induced by using the `volume` directive in the dockerfile of portus.
stressless upgrade of portainer to new release.
open a shell in a container and connect to it.
selecting "interactive & tty" should immediately go to the console screen when deploying the container.
"exec console" should work normally in swarm mode with an agent.
image is built and container deployed
able to connect to portainer instance on windows docker swarm using ip address:9000
i want to add 3 host entries to the /etc/hosts file in the container with this method, since the /etc/hosts file isn 't retained across host and subsequently container restarts.
the volume created should use the provided options
i should be able to update the azure registry without re-entering the password if it hasn't changed, or update with the correct password if it was incorrect previously and then still browse it as normal.
login and view only assigned endpoints.
i expect that none-admin users can also see the values of an endpoints in the dashboard of an endpoint
we expect the stack to be created just like in docker/linux mode
the graphs should show proper intervals at screen sizes smaller than 3000px wide.
be able to connect to the registry and browse contentx
`422 (unprocessable entity)` should be returned, and backend should not panic.
the access should be created without portainer complaining about the credentials.
healthy, paused and created containers should display and be filterable as is the case with stopped and running statuses
successfully connect to edge agent
as usual the container should be installed on the edge agent
as usual the stack should be installed on the edge agent
as this is the case on the docker server, the image should be successfully pulled
a `docker service create` or `docker stack deploy -c stackfile.yml` command that creates a portainer service without errors.
any items selected in a datatable should be kept as selected
there should be an error displayed if the image can 't be pulled e.g `no matching image for [os_here]`
portainer should use the domain name instead of the ip address of the server as `redirect_uri` for google oauth, when running behind a reverse proxy.
if i am a member of team(ldap group) and the team has permissions to use the endpoint - i expect to see conainers in dashboard and other views.
portainer only fetches containers and images when browsing the containers/images screens
i should be able to log in (i think).
after endpoint state updates, (status set to down), the view should be automatically refreshed to reflect this.
i should see all volumes from workers and managers alike.
a refresh should not collapse services.
do not allow invalid numbers as input where they don't make sense.
docker-compose file is pulled and stack is created
the task status table should not show when clicking the checkbox of a service.
a persistent volume added to a service should be saved.
as we are using this api call in our projects, we were expecting to be able to use it despite the new versions releases.
the last used ordering should be used, proposed in phofurl the issue has probably been introduced in phofurl
the portainer container with the tag 1.22.0 is created.
i expected to be able to grant access to a registry that i, as an administrator, configured.
containers to have variables set
backend should use the new url when it has been updated.
tables should default to sorting alphabetical by name, as is the default behavior in v1.21.0 and earlier
a continous connection to the swarm by portainer through its portainer agent interface.
there should be no box present.
resources added to portainer should be present and usable
it should still/always be able to connect.
portainer should use the state parameter in oauth.
if i update a `env` variable in a `dockerfile`, which is not overridden by manually adding it in portainer's ui, the change should be reflected on `recreate` and `duplicate/edit`.
when a docker command takes a long time to execute, portainer and the agent should still function properly.
if i specify that the portainer "/data" directory has an nfs share mapped onto it, it should work.
if an agent becomes unavailable, portainer should not be impacted.
agent should update its status to running on a manager node when the node is promoted.
ui settings to be persisted
stack is deployed using docker-compose from git repository.
i 'm expected to have visual on all of the images with the tags so i can manage them.
ip address of the containers should not change after reboot.
the ip addresses were bound to the containers earlier even after reboot.
after switching the language back, the terminal works as expected (shows typed text).
don't log the password hash, log only some of it, or allow turning the logging of it off.
if a secret label has a blank name, it should not be applied when the secret is created.
the portainer instance able to be able to reach the tcp-enabled daemon on port 2375.
able to login in portainer with ldap credentials steps to reproduce the behavior: insert username and password on login page
if a secret/config is assigned using the 'add a secret' or 'add a config' options, it should be hidden in the drop down list so you can't select it multiple times.
must not contain any whitespace" as error message
if all or part of a tag name is entered in the home view search box, all endpoints that match should be listed.
the `--admin-password-file` option should work given the docker-compose configuration above.
if authorize all or deny all is used, with multiple users or teams present in the users and teams or authorized users and teams tables, all entries should be moved.
if a team leader is removed from a team, the team leader count should be updated to reflect this change (i.e.
removing 1 from the count).
imported ldap users should be able to access all the resources that are part of the endpoint the administrator gave them access to.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
pull docker image from hub.docker.com briefly describe what you were expecting.
portainer has to much control on docker image form.
an input box with the full path would be more flexible.
if the hostname is not in registries list for credential, use the docker hub.
steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. add a new container with this image: 1. edit container and try to change image.
portainer successfully creates the stack and confirms this with a notification.
when accessing a service in a swarm that does not have the portainer agent present, i should not be able to access the stats and console actions on the nodes.
create a new stack and hit "deploy the stack", should create the new stack.
version 1.20.1 runs without problems.
i expect version 1.20.2 to do the same.
endpoint to be added using ui
the selected variable form the variable list should be used.
an error should be shown.
one of them is not that critical and i can ignore that but the other one is a bit annoying.
first let 's set the scene: if i let 's say change the network settings and assign something like on to postgres container that we just created above, and create another nginx settings to point that url to everything works perfectly in postgres.
but when i try to access container via provided link on containers page under 'published ports ' column, things start become a bit weird.
first, instead of seeing a url from a specific container 's network settings, i see url:port comes from _settings > endpoints > configuration > public ip_ makes little bit sense since it says > "url or ip address where exposed containers will be reachable.
this field is optional and will default the endpoint url."
but if remove entry, my urls start with `0.0.0.0` instead of ` phofurl which is also not correct or coming from postgre 's network settings.
this was first relatively smaller problem was talking about.
bigger problem here about these lines: phofurl that ` phofurl `" phofurl item.ipaddress }}:{{ p.port }}"` causes duplicate protocols in final urls.
so my ` becomes ` which totally wrong.
understand this was design choice in discussed in but my problem not about having public url being overruled by one everywhere, my problem about useless default http:// front.
p.s: yes, can remove public ip settings solve this but it causes an extra 301 redirect from http https which can be fixed by just removing default protocol code.
like other pages that requires an endpoint be selected first, such as containers, images, redirect to `portainer.home`.
not to show blank page briefly describe what you were expecting.
i 'd expect portainer to respond similar to docker itself: phofcode
expects to see: stacks, volumes, services, networks in dashboard
all ajax docker api requests succeed (except those unsupported) briefly describe what you were expecting.
frequently but not always, ajax docker api requests respond 'i/o timeout ' some pages issue multiple ajax docker api requests at the same time.
then these pages may have higher probability to encounter 'i/o timeout '.
for example, 'dashboard ' / 'containers create ' in fact, other pages such as images also have lower chances to respond 'i/o timeout ' response `{"err":"unable to proxy the request via the docker character 'i ' looking for beginning of value"}` dashboard makes 2 consecutive ajax requests ` phofurl ` phofurl containers create makes this request twice ` phofurl
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
setting to unlimited will persist across container restarts
it should `post phofurl (notice the arguments) if i manually do the post from postman wit the authorization header, it pull perfectly
the left columns are at least wide enough to display the text in them in one line and the right columns fill the remaining space.
there should be only one stack called "portainer" instead of two.
for the submodule cloning to work as expected and the stack on it to be deployed.
zip files should be intact after download.
the chosen network container sub-option sticks between edits screenshot of how it should look phofimage
i expected to see the ports sorted in order of published port.
in my case, i would have expected this: phofcode
host jobs should use the same repository configuration as other locations.
it seems that host jobs ignores this configuration
pull from gitlab.com private registry using various tags or subdomains.
allow empty/null values for labels set on containers.
this is valid per the docker spec and some utilities use labels with empty labels to help with auto-discovery
deploying stack concurrently should allocate one id per stack.
during parsing templates.json, portainer should not wrap single quotes in additional quotes.
as well, according to json standard, one does not have to escape single quotes within double quotes.
clicking on network should result with the right network page.
creating a team named 'a & b' should not be converted to `a &amp; b`
node name should be editable from node details page.
link to source phofhyperlink .
volumes should have the same ownership like the container creating it.
when volumes not having the ownership of the creator, they can't be removed by them but only by an administrator.
image pulled and containers started
i expect portainer to show my running containers, the same ones that show up just fine in `docker ps`
the other two and gateways are presented in the detail page.
i expected the portainer agents to be able to form a cluster and portainer to show the containers of all nodes.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
i expected to be able to download pre-compiled binaries for 1.20.0
should have a flag in the create network screen for macvlan to "enable manual container attachment "
if there are insecure registries, they should be supported.
user should be able to use https or http.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
the container should start in the same way it does when started from command line, using docker-"compose up".
the container is created but not started.
"oci runtime error" is thrown.
create container stop container edit container env variables leave published ports config alone redeploy with all prev.
settings and changed env variables
expect and this is doable by manually editing: screenshot at 2 08 33 pm phofimage
the container should be re-renamed after failure to its old name
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
application should run after upgrade.
these lines should be `going over pending ways...` `completed planet_osm_point` `completed planet_osm_point` `osm2pgsql took 22s overall` it should be same as `docker logs` command line.
the image will be pulled and be available for use.
i expect endpoint is created
red prompt should show "container xxx is not running" as in v1.19.2
when only one container is present, the summary should read "1 container" instead of "1 container
update the template succesfully through the api.
the number of open files should be much less briefly describe what you were expecting.
existing container with logging configs should preserve the settings from the container, instead of always reset to default.
i want to create, modify or save container environment variable like the synology docker gui.
that portainer can connect to the cluster.
1.configuration of incorrect private repositories is not allowed 2.even if the private repositories connection is abnormal, the registry management page load should not be affected.
macvlan should be listed under drivers.
portainer should list file for gluster volumes
a new stack added from git repository.
to restart the host system and still have full control over my stacks
the stack should create a network with the specified subnet.
being able to update the endpointid with the website or the api
mounting the relative path should be relative to the docker-compose.yaml file.
it somehow mounts phofcode on the host instead of phofcode briefly describe what you were expecting.
endpoint to be evaluated as a unix socket and not a http one.
portainer tries to "get" request when it should really be trying to communicate over the socket instead.
the tls 1.0 connection request should be rejected:
environmental variables should be added.
possible expected behaviors: - remove the network only if no other stack is using it - do not remove the network - remove the stack even if the network is not available
portainer should detect the config change and reflect the changesm instead just hangs.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
the stack should either be listed or the post request should give an error
when a service update is triggered with `pull latest image version` selected, the latest image should be pulled and the service should start using it
i install the image on my computer, after that, i save the image using the following: `docker save -o portainer.tar portainer/portainer` then i move the file to another machine and i load image by following: `docker load -i portainer.tar`
the service would update to the latest version of that image and would be able to get the image from the private aws ecr registry using the auth credentials from phofhyperlink .
this works when clicking update in stack page but not service page.
the container to have been recreated sharing the network stack of the other container specified.
i expect the view to have the group's name like when i login as admin
selected value is inserted into stack/compose file
after scaling a service from 1 -> 0 -> 1 containers, the scaled-up container has the environment variables, configured in the portainer ui, set in the container.
composer's stacks name should be the same as defined in portainer
the entry point in the add container page should be multiple lines and saved as an array.
i expected to see "app templates" section under settings.
i wanted to disable "hide external contributions" so i have access to linuxserver.io templates.
after entering hub.docker.com credentials into the form on the registry screen i can pull my private images from the docker hub.
the stack should deploy without an error.
should be able to create an overlay network across all nodes briefly describe what you were expecting.
i 'd expect the info in container details to be coherent with that in section 'images '.
after adding new external endpoint to allow manage access to it even without default group.
or set default group to new external endpoints.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
start two containers instead of three (1 failing).
i expected 200 response code.
when i name a container `foo`, i expect to see it listed with then name `foo` in the container list.
in my opinion, the expected behavior would be opening a tab with the url: `<ip address of port of the service>` e.g.
swarm manager ip address: service name: svc-1 published port: 9001, target port: 80 (i.e.
`-p the expected behavior when clicking on link of the published port would be opening a new tab with url: ` phofurl
service details panel should display the log driver specified at the daemon level if no additional one has been specified at the service level.
simply being able to connect to running docker.
the input field for the the image of a service looks like a normal text field, and should act like one.
overflowed text should continue to the right, instead of being wrapped down.
and, i should be able to move the text cursor past width of field in order to see and edit text.
when i open a service details page, the page should start with scrolling at the top of the page.
i expect to see my logo clearly in both places.
on the blue background menu and on the white background login page.
change the background in the login screen.
or give an option to upload 2 different logos.
> .... creating admin user with password hash ... > .... starting portainer 1.19.1 on :9000 ....
user gets created in portainer and is allowed to log in.
the ui must show every container template add by user.
i expect to see compose stack templates alongside the swarm and single container templates.
should be able to connect to an existing running swarm when installing a fresh install of portainer.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the login should be accepted, with any special character once it is a passphrase not a variable raplacement.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
correct loadout of the template file.
on portainer before last release version it was working with a repository url of ` phofurl then i changed the url to a `ssh://` one and updated portainer to latest and the error described above starts happening.
should open logs or console when clicked
empty environment variables should just be rendered with their name and no trailing =.
networks and volumes should only show the available resources of the node i have chosen in the deployment section of the create container page.
portainer functions properly with gitlab registry.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
no password should be transmitted to client if there are no absolute need of that.
even it is required, it should not be done in plain text anyway.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
"registry" parameter for container templates should be honored and used by portainer to pull image as necessary (using auth if registry is configured in portainer to do so).
also changes to the template "registry" choice via the portainer template ui should result in proper updates visible through the ui.
network parameter should be updatable via portainer template ui.
that the unamed volumes get the same ownership as the container/service/stack they belong to.
in a swarm environment the stack creation of a yml file hosted in a git repository doesn 't work.
the gui shows a error in upper right corner e in the logs it 's showed: starting portainer 1.19.1 on :9000 http error: unable to clone git repository (err=repository already exists) (code=500) the username and password are correct.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
steps to reproduce the issue: briefly describe what you were expecting.
`--no-auth` flag means going to the url loads the home page instead of the authentication screen.
container side should only containt 8080 while host side should contain 20001
if a docker node goes down, portainer restarts on another node.
portainer should automatically reconnect to the existing portainer agents.
listing templaes of type container and stack;
only administrator should be able to see these.
in a swarm environment the stack creation of a yml file hosted in a git repository doesn 't work.
the gui shows a error in upper right corner e in the logs it 's showed: starting portainer 1.18.1 on :9000 http error: invalid jwt token (err=invalid jwt token) (code=401) http error: invalid jwt token (err=invalid jwt token) (code=401) http error: invalid token (err=invalid token) (code=401) http error: unable to clone git repository (err=repository already exists) (code=500) the username and password are correct.
briefly describe what you were expecting.
parameter `external` can be used in docker-compose.yml to create a stack without getting an error.
that stack deployment works like it does on 1.18.1.
not jumping around int the log and just update the log to latest stoudlines briefly describe what you were expecting.
- users should be able to access to container consoles via portainer web interface
when i create a stack, only one stack should be created and the container should be associated to the created stack.
when issuing an api request to the docker api on one container like should work as it does in the ui.
i would expect to see the stacks, services or nodes of the swarm
everywhere i see a task/container in a list, i should see all currently active action buttons/links and they should work consistently.
any actions buttons/links that are not available should either not be visible at all, or should be shown but greyed out and clearly disabled.
i expect node to be reachable under nat too.
console windows opens correctly in portainer
proper storage of compose files.
remote console-access and listing of containers located anywhere in the swarm.
deploying from a template works as intended every time.
especially if it's the same template.
when the page auto refreshes, the list of tasks on each node should sorted in the same manner.
portainer should also show it as 3/3
we expected that the stack start working and all mount volumes be assign correctly like when we run the command "docker service create".
i expected my container to get recreated after being turned down with the latest image pushed to gcr.
the defined named volume should be selected in the service page.
portainer instance successfully retrieves docker info from agent.
showing `rexray/s3fs:latest` as a volume driver on creation
it was expected that the swarm would update, just as if i had pasted the file contents into portainer and clicked update stack.
text should be paste as it is, no changes
the same as `git clone`, which doesn 't fail: bash $ git clone phofurl
mounted volumes should not be tagged as unused
change the yaml for a stack and hit update, should update the stack.
in this case i am change the image used.
i expected to have shown the task filtered in according to filter string.
steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. go to stacks list page 2. click on one stack configured 3. scroll down task section 4. insert some string search.
i can normally access portainer through a reverse proxy and https.
the portainer app must be able to authenticate user no matter how many master nodes exists.
80 -> 9000/tcp host -> container
able to * update * existing stacks, either with or without making changes to the stack file.
the ability to define multiple host file entries and for them to be saved to the running docker container and then displayed in the ui.
changing the password should be possible.
: scroll bar should respond, content in the console should be scrolled other notes: the issue doesn 't happen if: 1. other browser is used (firefox) 2. left panel (mentioned in
should set the value for all rows for the newly added field to false
it 's expected that the upsert command would query for the item and update it if it exists and only create a new entry if one does not exist.
the resolver should implement the generated interface properly.
null values can be queried via go
embedded types and other stuff as enums are clearly marked as such in this array or not there at all.
prisma_config can be loaded from docker secret.
expected it to deploy properly
a method to easily add an array to a query should exist.
i am aware of a $graphql interface being available for simple queries, but not for mutations.
@embedded types should not require @relation if that is not possible, adding @relation should be backwards compatible with having no @relation
obviously "work", but, duh ... looks like prisma tries to drop all the columns and re-add them, and perhaps it can 't do that for a column with a fk and an index key.
but on the contrary this is very common for a mysql db.
maybe it 's related to the uppercase vs lowercase of the column names in datamodel and database, however i haven 't been able to solve when changing these around.
`createsomeentity` needs to reject only once.
and error should reach client code only once.
everything works like it works on local dev
embedded types and other stuff as enums are clearly marked as such in this array or not there at all.
the query / actions work.
`prisma seed` authenticates against local prisma server based on provided env file and seeds the database.
as mentioned in the documentation phofhyperlink "the only exception is the null value, meaning that multiple nodes can have the value null without violating the constraint."
however, when null is set explicitly to multiple objects it violates unique constraint
the raised error within createuser should trigger the catch statement and not require an explicit reject function as second parameter in then
working without errors p/s: it actually was running flawlessly some days before, but today i can 't manage to make it work again
i expected it to generate without having to require an id or for the documentation to explicitly say that an id field is required in order for the generated code to work.
for example, this doc says nothing about the id field being required.
i should get response something like this phofcode
it should take 1s to deploy
i expect my prisma server will not run crash if the 3rd party metrics endpoint goes down
return all rows where relation is null
i expect all elements in the list to be updated, but only one is (the last in the list).
application will start running as expected using prisma api/graphql
to have the same version on npm i -g prisma as on npx prisma (maybe?)
i suspect that i can use positional filtering when deleting embed subresources.
assuming the type `long` is designed to hold greater numbers than javascript support, you should either update long to be `string | number` or force it to be a `string` when retrieving the result from the server.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
get is ok ,but post will report an error
by specifying `database: foo` i expected that prisma will use `foo` as the schema in the db.
should be able to use the `endpoint` for both the generated client and the `prisma deploy` command.
we should upgrade `prisma-cli-engine` to use a later version of this package (0.6.2).
i believe it should be like phofcode
once the load is reduced, prisma server should "recover" and start accepting queries again.
should return same values that pgadmin
prisma should be able to deploy enum type if underlying type is a string.
should have returned the results without any errors
no `data` param and put `params` directly into `method` defined.
must be filled with data
`prisma deploy --no-migrate` shouldn 't fail since the database has the correct schema.
app deploys using self-referencing variables.
prisma should deploy with no error from the server.
creation of the new service: i.e.
creation of corresponding mongodb collections, + up& running service/playground.
prisma cli displays list of available commands, and isglobal is false.
it should start the interactive process
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the model should be deployed.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the orderbyinput of the prisma client should 'nt expose the `createdat_asc`, `createdat_desc`, `updatedat_asc` and `updatedat_desc` if not provided in the datamodel.
i'd expect prisma to return me an object w/ all the properties described on the user type.
server upgrades proceed as normal.
prisma ignores un-managed tables, or is at least able to deal with unsupported column types in a graceful way.
the warning should not appear.
when running locally, calling `prisma delete` removes the postgres schema and tables.
we expect this behavior to work the same for remote hosts.
furthermore, if the command isn 't successful, we would expect to receive an error.
i expected the error to not appear just like it didn 't on `heroku`... but due to dns problems, i am trying to host it on `now`.
the same code works on `heroku` when deployed using github phofurl phofhyperlink
when creating new objects, i expect the output to be as follows: phofcode
there should be no error, and the next step in the wizard (generation option) should appear and in the end the prisma.yml, schema.prisma and generated folders and its content (depending on generator selection: ts, js, ... , none) should appear in directory prisma init command is run.
prisma should return the subfolder: phofcode
i would expect you to be able to query by the user as well as by the admin id, e.g.
cli should write the correct directive
should cancel deploy with clear error message that `strategy: sequence` requires a `@sequence` decorator
why prisma created a database called prisma in my mysql server.
is there a way to not create this database?
what is the role of this database?
i would expect the result of the above query to instead be: phofcode ...where events with empty rsvps lists are excluded, since there is no user to match the `rsvps_every` clause
expect data would be added to the db specified in docker-compose.yml
prisma export should retry queries after waiting a little bit when they fail, instead of failing.
i would expect a null value to be returned since the specified query does not match the result
`allsubcategories` should not be empty.
i expect exacltly the same models to be generated no matter from where i run `prisma introspect`
expect generation to fail, but it still succeeds since it connects to endpoint from prisma.yml.
if the endpoint in prisma.yml is changed to `endpoint: phofurl and using the command `prisma generate --endpoint phofurl then the command fails since it tries to connect ` phofurl instead of ` phofurl provided on command-line.
expect the `generate` command use `endpoint` argument provided on command-line _over_ endpoint value defined in prisma.yml when: - connecting prisma service - generating source code.
the used `endpoint` value for constructing a prisma client instance should have value from command-line.
2. using a dynamic endpoint in `prisma.yml` fails generation of client.
the prisma cli is able connect prisma service, so somewhere is correctly evaluated and, in case environment values are not set, default values are being used.
however, dynamic value does not seem be evaluated when using it generating source code.
instead is directly put `endpoint` for constructing a new prisma client instance which results a typescript syntax error.
i have not tested this, but i assume fails for all client types.
because of this error, `generate` command does _not_ produce any output.
implicit `prisma generate` respects `-p` option.
if i run `prisma generate -p subdir/prisma.yml` it works as expected.
expected birthdate to be persisted and returned.
just to work as before: return the data from the database without an authentication token (which is neither the prisma service token, neither the prisma cluster token).
it should be parsed as a local url and should not trigger cloud authentication flow.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
that i would get a mysql table with uuid as the pk (as the docs suggest)
the manual redeploy after the rename should work just fine, as there are no required fields that aren 't filled out
it should probably return a `[]`, but better would be an ast of default types.
shut the server down properly.
to have a way to execute a where statement with a list of the enum values.
prisma init should wire up the relationships correctly and deployably.
`categorywhereinput` should have the fields below: - `tags_some` - `tags_every` - `tags_none`
get all users with provided father id (user 2, user 3).
the result of prisma client contains the embedded data also.
it'd be great if prisma recognized the bigint as a bigint and didn't error out on introspection
the data model should be added to the schema.graphql automatically
psql date types should be supported by the datetime declaration in prisma.
should not generate: phofcode ... and correct generated file should be phofcode ... phofcode ... phofcode ...
and then it should be possible to make updates and queries to consultancy based on organization id, since its 1-1 and so unique e.g.
data: { ... }, where: { organization: {id: id} }) currently as i see its not possible.
yes, its possible via many filtering, but its less than ideal, e.g.
on update it wont return object, on retrieve it return array instead of single object etc
scalar list should use embedded as the default.
it should also be allowed explicitly.
prisma generate should do magic, not errors!
(an empty folder is of no use tbh)
the id should only be raised when the node is actually created.
an additional yml dictionary of connection options which could be passed along to the connection objects.
given the query i 've described above, count should be 1. it always returns 0 when filtering by a parent association.
it returns a new incremental id (starting at 10000, increasing 1 by 1) in the field where `@id` is assigned.
an error should happen here as `casacade` is should not be a valid parameter for that directive.
prisma should be able to handle this scenario
if createdat or modifiedat are not defined, they should be excluded from the generate database table.
a way to filter out relation that is set.
properly handled error with a proper error text.
it should generate a pirsma client in specified languages and downloads prisma graphql schema
prisma init workflow should generate a correct `docker-compose.yml` file.
prisma init workflow should introspect existing mongodb
use the prisma.yml specified by the -p flag in conjunction with the env-file specified by the -e flag
prisma server should reject this datamodel on any field that has type `uuid` for mysql or mongo
it is expected that the cli works with a self-hosted secured server even if the prisma cli is "logged in".
fallback: the cli recognises a wrong configuration and suggests to log out.
expected the export to work the same way as it does locally and create a zip-file for me.
given the connection and environment is sane/valid, no errors should occur.
i hope my record be: phofcode but i get: phofcode
execute operations in the specified order.
instead of returning all objects, it should return 0 objects.
it should behave similar to sql in-query logic.
the expected type would be `user | null`
it should provide an option to connect to the database without introspection.
expecting to have a `datamodel.prisma` sdl that matches our db schema.
prisma cli should `schema` name to `docker-compose.yml` file.
`registeredat` field should work as `createdat` be a read-only and in `prisma-client` generated file should be a `datatimeoutput` instead of `datatimeinput`
deletemany should remove only entries that have both the matching sourceid and field name.
what actually happens is that everything matching the field name gets removed and the sourceid is seemingly ignored.
- connector: mongodb - prisma server: 1.29.0 - `prisma` cli: prisma/1.29.0 - os: os x high sierra other dependencies: prisma-client
a query with the entire document.
prisma should not crash when the `node` type is added
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
cli should parse the urls correctly for non localhost urls as well
prisma init to generate schema.
here's a dump of the database i'm using: schema.sql.txt phofhyperlink
prisma should return the deleted object
i 'm expecting 2 things here really: 1) for `prisma init` to automatically detect that i 'm using foreign keys rather than relation tables and to set up the `@pgrelation` directive in the generated datamodel.
2) for the `@pgrelation` directive to work and not throw the above error.
database connection succeed as same as prev version.
i would expect something like: phofcode nb: `@pgrelation` is needed for postgresql
upgrade dependence to `npm-run@5.0.1` which is already remove package `sync-exec` from it's dependences.
when executing `prisma generate` on the command line, prisma successfully generates both the schema and the client in the `generated` directory.
i would expect same behavior when `prisma generate` is executed as a `post-deploy` hook.
what i expect to get is the `user` data plus the `post` data from the query
expected that i could deploy & create my service.
i would expect to have a `postsconnection` on `user`.
create a customer succesfully linking its type to an existing type.
i would expect prisma to connect to the local mysql database and run on phofurl
`prisma deploy` should deploy without any errors.
be able to remove one relation and add another.
based on the docummenation, i should be able to use set like this, or an array of ids with disconnect.
phofcode i don 't have set on my schema, i only have disconnect as a boolean.
queries to return without errors.
correctly parse the after or before argument to return the next 'paged ' results/edges for the query
the expected behavior would be to correctly deploy the schema to the hosted db, and execute the post-deploy script to get the generated schema.
directory should only be created after all information is extracted from the init workflow.
both commands `generate` and `deploy should accept ampersand `&` syntax
run the query without error and return a slice of `user`s.
no errors and `prisma deploy` is successful after `docker-compose up -d`.
the images should have been imported.
the prisma server should be use the existing database since it already has some data.
error: `you have several updates affecting the same area of the document underlying user.
mongomessage: updating the path 'times ' would create a conflict at 'times '`
prisma containers should be deployed.
prisma should validate the schema for invalid type names and return a user-friendly error (e.g.
"invalid type name: type must start with an uppercase letter").
i didn 't quite expect the hack to work, and i don 't quite know what the problem is.
however, i do expect the aggregate count to work properly without me having to repeat myself thrice :)
generated schema should have phofcode instead of phofcode
generated interface should look like this: phofcode
should create different databases for different stages.
ie: phofurl => "project@api_dev" ie: phofurl => "project@api_test"
i should be able to create a company without also having to create a store in the database
query displays all user permissions with the users associated with them or null if they have none.
the *whereinput array fields are pointers
i was expecting prisma to deploy the schema on the remote server
the migration table should be created in the project database.
chaining like ctx.db.student({ id }).school().name() used to work and return the scalar value.
should generate a proper file used in the future
this shall work with both schemas, indifferently where the relation is stored.
service deploys to cluster correctly
i was expecting the prisma api to be deployed
import of data into database from external json file
since prisma server thinks this datamodel is valid the generate command should not throw any error.
the migration should just work, maybe outputting an additional hint about how migrations are handled with mongodb and linking to the docs.
prisma should pay attention to whether the relation is nullable or non-nullable in datamodel.
non-nullable relation in datamodel: phofcode is expected to make prisma create a non-nullable relation field: phofcode nullable relation in datamodel: phofcode is expected to make prisma create a nullable field: phofcode nullable
the generated datamodel file should look like this: phofcode the generated `docker-compose.yml` should: - use the prisma docker image `1.24` (i 'm on `prisma/1.24.0 (darwin-x64) node-v10.13.0`) - have `migrations` set to `false` - `ssl` set to `true`
i just expect prisma container to work.
to connect to new demo sever
expect data: { iscanceled: true } })` to get executed and be reflected in the db.
the users with the two uuids above should be disconnected from the campaign entity.
it should return an array with a user where id ends with the provided string.
expected to deploy to my private prisma server
i would like to see: $ go run ./server server is running on phofurl
any unique field other than id should be added to `userwhereuniqueinput ` after regenerating.
the ability to handle or escape special characters for existing (and new) fields.
the above mutation should succeed without a failure.
should be able to query on either field.
it is supposed to only query `id` field from mongo, not all other useless fields, in order to save band width and improve performance.
i firstly set up db with django orm.
some tables have a relation column each other with option ` 'related_name= '`.
i think this is generated to @relation(name: something) into datamodel.prisma.
but the problem is the generated result is something like this `@relation(name: it is missing the double quote, the first uppercase letter, and underscores.
i changed it to `@relation(name: then it deployed successfully.
using float64 for float type
using playground i can set this field to `null` normally, i think the golang client needs to do the same phofcode
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
admin is required field when creating.
since admin.connect.id is invalid for id type, the document should not be created
prisma should be able to connect to postgres.
should return the records without the reference, not crash
in the postgres connector, relational fields can be used in `where` queries.
the server should be deployed correctly.
* i 'm using prisma cli v1.22.2 * i ran `prisma account` and i 'm logged in
json should be mapped correctly to postgres json type
throw error, that `dates: [datetime]` is not valid and suggest actual possible values.
i should have the list of posts (here juste the one i created) and the associated author.
i expect my schema to be loaded and be able to execute operations on the api.
the `deploy` command to run properly.
i dont think we should be needing to manually modify the incoming arguments specifically for `enum` lists.
for the deploy to be succesful
a proper connection of web socket should be established
type changes seamlessly, without loosing data and breaking required status
to see the results without any error.
both ingredients and author should be returned.
`a`, `x` and `y` should be deleted.
i was expecting that prisma client is producing more optimized queries (less db round trips), something like we can achieve with facebook dataloader.
should be printed to the console the message like `saving prisma client (graphql) at
expected to retrieve a single record
the column `:max` looks like an internal thing.
the prisma server error logs should include something to help debug this.
the error message returned to the client should include something to help debug this.
the primsa server docs should have some links to how the docker image is created so there is some way add our own debugging when this happens.
`data` should be of type which allows scalar fields updates only
the example code to work.
i expect my new service to be created and the schema supplied in `prisma.yml` under `datamodel` to be deployed.
prisma deploy should execute successfully
it should throw an error saying phofcode or something like that
should return getmany when a relation is an array.
no error running the generate command.
the query should contain the user along with its associated membership and list.
should get the same result as with `"target": " * / * "`
the js based schema generator should match the actual prisma schema.
phofcode musn't remove prisma-demo-2 from my services
the subscription should work as documentation
the fluent api should work.
it should execute the mutation without error.
the layout of the services breaks, it should at least be scrollable fixing: possible to use `overflow-x: scroll;` for the page (i tested quickly on chrome devtool and it works, or make the table columns react to viewport size change
in go, i should see `type data struct{...}` include `letter`, but it does no
to execute the prisma playground.
i can have a number bigger than
the ability to choose arbitrary compile options for my own code, without conflict with the generated prisma client.
i should be able to take advantage of docker-compose networking tooling with prisma (a container can reference another container 's ip address using its name).
referencing the prisma server from another service by its name (e.g.
idem in k8s when referencing prisma by its service name from another pod.
to not receive the error when the email does not exist in the db.
i would expect franz to also show up in bob 's friend list.
> we should `cd` into the folder and change this to the programmatic implementation that runs the command directly without spawn
the cli should wait until the `migrationstatus.status` field returns either or `rollback_failure`, which represent finished deployments.
in case the deployment results in an error, the contents of the `errors` field should be printed.
also a message should be printed that migration has not been performed and this is likely not a transient issue.
a new record should be created in the `articulo` table relating to the `menu` with id: 4 and a new record in the table `articulo_detalle`
in step 5, prisma client should return the same error that prisma api returns in step 2.
to my understanding, both prisma servers shouldn 't need to communicate since they will be operating with different apps/endpoints, so they both should be considered as "main servers" and be able to use the management api (they manage different things )
in that example, the value of the `iteratorresult` (`result.value`) should be of type instead is of some type `{ user: usersubscriptionpayload }`.
the subscription to type b should have been fired for each update and deletion that took place.
the subscription would fire for each of the deleted records of type b, as it would if they were deleted or created through other means.
i would like an autocomplete as i had before the fix (which i still have on the other branch by the way).
see screenshot below : screenshot from phofimage
the raw graphql request is executed.
* either, we cannot set `uuid` for the `id` field * or, when running `createtest` as above, the `id` field is automatically generated.
for there not to be any errors.
consecutive pages of users are paged correctly.
it 'd exit with the error from the command.
prisma client would not impose any naming restrictions on model names.
i 'd expect the prisma service to spin up, detect the postgres database, create a database within it, populate it with tables and carry on its way.
i would expect it to behave like in command prompt.
i would like to obtain the total number of items, as the previous versions of prisma worked.
deployment is interrupted, giving you an error message that `boolean` or `string` is not a valid type name.
did you mean `boolean` or` string`?
to still be on a paid plan and not see degraded performance.
i suppose firstly, i 'd expect it to not crash with an "unexpected error".
stated differently, if i am doing something wrong, i 'd expect it to tell me what i am missing rather than display a development stack trace.
instead of returning an error, the cli should tell the user to copy/paste the url, and keep listening for successful login
we should be able to provide a selection set for arrays.
the env variable / template literal should be processed and not cause any errors.
expected subscriber to be notified of the insert
panic: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not map[string]interface {}
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the generated type for a to-one relation should have `userwhereuniqueinput` as the input argument type.
prisma connects to the mysql container on port `3307`.
`prisma init` should run without errors
there should be no errors, and i should see the list of projects linked to my prisma instance.
i have no issue with the `v1.16` about deploying the datamodel, or run post-deploy hooks like `graphql get-schema -p prisma` and `graphql codegen`.
the command should fail for invalid prisma configuration.
lower case enums should be accepted.
(first: 1, skip:0) should return the first log on user not all logs on user...
i would expect not to have gotten an error message.
as i am following the guide exactly step by step i would expect to have a running application after typing phofcode into the terminal.
return post not null and have content = "hello world" for that user instead post will still be null and no content
it should return the only user (username=federico) with the three loaded universities with the first 10 careers for each university, but is only returning the first 5 careers for harvard, first 5 for cambridge, and all 3 careers for oxford.
i expect the behavior to be the same as running without `migrations: false`.
postgresql array fields should still be supported.
no internal server error would be ncie
no internal error (deadlock nor constraint violation)
consistent behavior, either generate such a field in both cases or don't.
alternatively, it might be worth creating two distinct input types for these two cases.
returned exitcode should be `>=1`
all configuration shouldn't be passed through an environmental variable.
each sensitive parameter should be configurable through its own environmental variable.
the non sensitive ones can be still part of `prisma_config`, although i would still recommend having a separate environment variable for each configuration parameter like `grafana` does for example phofhyperlink .
return one post ordered by date.
if you color the text black it appears
i expect the data on the destination server to be identical to the data on the source server, but nested array relationships are lost.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it should not throw an error.
it should not be possible to create such a relation, the name should be reserved and the creation should fail with an error.
either: a) i should get an error message on creation, telling me that this model is invalid.
b) the crud schema should be generated differently for this special case.
the return type should be `[book!
]!` and not `[book]!`, otherwise this mean we can have this kind of response `[null]`... :disappointed: phofcode
i would expect the queries and subscriptions to preserve the capitalization of the type, like this: `rsvp(...)` (query / subscription) `rsvps(...)` `rsvpsconnection(...)`
running `prisma playground` when electron app is installed opens playground in electron app.
see something in the playground schema explorer
it should write the latest version.
works with prisma 1.13 dosn 't work with prisma 1.14 and 1.15
value should be inserted as enum
i expect the subscriptions for both the app and the prisma api to respond to all changes to the user model.
i would like to query the baskets that contain "apple", but i can 't, because there 's no filter generated for the "fruits" field.
breaking changes are not a big deal but it would be great if they get documented in the release notes so that you can anticipate the changes that need to be made.
the datamodel change is deployed without an error.
* ideally everything would just work as expected (both `rating` and `meta` return data with no exceptions thrown).
* neither `prisma introspect` or `prisma deploy` did complain about the schema
the presence of an exclamation point with an enum in graphql shouldn 't affect the case sensitivity of the column name.
`prisma list` should displays my local deployed service
you should be able to use the uuid column as intended without insertion errors.
instead, you will get an error, and the prisma server will report that the database threw an error for "incorrect string value".
expected connection to happen, or error saying that it must be a full url, i.e.
i would expect not to see internal prisma errors thrown in prisma cloud

i expect the cpu memory to be constant throughout the inference loop.
i observe the expected behavior for all combinations except for those that combine torchscript and dataparallel.
an interesting observation is that the rate of cpu memory leakage does not seem to be correlated with model size or minibatch size.
for all combinations of torchscript and dataparallel, memory leaked at a rate of ~148kb/minibatch.
i expect indexing to be quite quick.

i would expect both the expressions 'tensor.fill_(0) ' and 'tensor = 0 ' to compile and that they would yield the same result.
looking at the source code the selected assignment operator is defined as follows: inline tensor & tensor::operator=(scalar v) && { return fill_(v); } that is, it is only defined for rvalues on lhs of assignment.
i do not understand rationale behind this restriction.
because it consumes memory unexpectedly, i cannot run my code on the cpu.
(it works fine on gpu.)
`git status` should be clean, either because that directory doesn 't exist or because it 's in `.gitignore`.
i expect the resnet50 to not freeze/return the output tensor in ios via pytorch mobile.

the converted onnx model could be loaded with onnxruntime
the observers must be inserted because the argument for qconofig is provided
ideally please do support empty tensors phofhyperlink .
i hit these issues with empty tensors during exporting/tracing, and cannot use `jit.script` because i want to export to onnx.
even thought exceptions such as > runtimeerror: non-empty 3d or 4d input tensor expected but got ndim: 4 are not that great, at least we can try-catch and work around it.
ideally, flow-sensitive typing would work with fields variables.
notably, this already works if you don 't put these variables with containers (i.e.
you work with "raw" `optional[int]`s).
it's not clear to me why this should use so much memory.
the second example demonstrates that this information can clearly be printed out without incurring any extra memory cost.
the transformer mask generator is meant to create a mask that prevents information from future tokens to affect current predictions, thus preventing them from seeing future tokens.
expected output: phofcode from the transformer docs phofhyperlink it is not producing the expected behavior.
phofcode if we decompose the function.
phofcode not casting the mask matrix to float earlier is causing unexpected behavior with masked fill and boolean matrix referenced here `masked_fill(mask == 0, float( '-inf ')` .
should be able to script the whole model.
it should return a 1d tensor consisting of elements whose corresponding boolean index is true, like what it is done for the transposed tensor.
script runs and exits after printing "all done".
it should also return 0 to be consistent.
an exception should be raised if kernel, padding, or stride number of dimensions doesn't match number of convolution dimensions.
the result of the last line should be `tensor([1.5000, 3.5000])`
i would expect that adding two `int64` values would result in an int, not a `float32`
we expect to have our model exported, even if it has its convolutional blocks swapped with another type of block.
ideally, we would want to swap all the blocks of the model, not just the first one, as in the example given.
it should not throw an error :)
in above code, expecting `tensor([[ 0, 11], [ 0, 0]], device='cuda:0', dtype=torch.int16)`.
should equal `sparse.to_dense()` or raise an error.
i believe to_dense is impacted because it's calling add.
these should probably be the same.
also, i don't think it makes sense for `tensor.sum(dim=())` to do a full reduce.
this special casing caused the bug at phofurl and i suspect the gradient for things like torch.var may be incorrect right now.
a tracedmodule should be convertable to a scriptmodule as explained in the jit tutorial.
non error, and the module will be reloadable and retrainable.
the result should be all true, or at least the same for different runs.
i would expect q2 and q3 to be the same and close to q.
code 2 works like code 1
we should cleanup entries for this map as autograd context ids are cleaned up.
or we should have a field in `distautogradcontext` instead.
deallocating the data does not deadlock.
the script above does not fail.
simply checking if the desired key/val to `.pop()` is in `state_dict` will solve this issue.
i think this should be the default if `strict = false`.
calculating max_norm should not make the embedding layer weight non leaf variable.

the header files on `math` and `threadpool` should be included on the built package because they are included on the other header files, such as on file phofcode
torch.as_tensor() create a named tensor just like torch.tensor()
even as it is maybe not the best style, to return class attributes in lambdas, it should not result in a memory leak.
set device should not even be called on a single gpu device because device 0 will always be used anyway.
even without jit, `slice` in opset10 should use shape information dynamically when `dynamic_axes` is used.
input to have correct type
it holds t2) == t1 and t1.masked_scatter(m, t2) == t2, since t1 has the same value as t2.
step 7 outputs should be same.
with pytorch 1.2, i have phofcode
running the same computation multiple times should give the same result everytime for the same input.
phofcode however, when i try an int tensor, it doesn't happen.
provided both indices and values are placed on the same device, should return a sparse tensor on that device.
error message should say that the attribute exists but is of an unrecognized type.

memory consumption stays constant as the first iteration.
type promotion should work correctly and the second assignment above should assign correct values.
i see that this is a corner case, but if we change to `dev = torch.device( 'cpu ')` we get phofcode which i see as more reasonable.
i 'd expect the backward pass to run at least 100 times faster.
in fact, the performance is as expected when running the script on a different computer.
performance for `linear` layers is also as expected.
the save function should be able to find the source code.
the offending code is located at the call `source = ' '.join(obj)` fails.
in version 1.2 this line retrieves the source code of the nn.module with the inspect package, but now it seems to try to access string representation of nn.module
cholesky of a positive definite matrix shouldn't run into an error.
open for discussion, but i don 't think we should have a user error here.
the script above can be fixed by running `join_rpc()` after the rrefs are garbage collected (such as in the parent function), but this does not seem robust.
in particular, there are no real guarantees (afaik) of when exactly the garbage collection will happen and the user can use `gc` to modify this.
should we provide a way for user to say they are done using rref?
a few ideas are: stop holding remote ref once `to_here` is called (this makes sense to me, since user now has value locally), or use a context manager that wraps `init_model_parallel` and `join_rpc` to garbage collect everything that is needed.

i would expect the scatter and gather timings to be a lot closer than this, not a factor of 5 out.

the above snippet should run without an assertionerror.
the problematic assertion must only be checked if `kdim is none and vdim is none`, i.e., if is true`.

so, in this assertion should only be checked if is false`.

i expect to save the model as .onnx.

either this should work or be documented as not working.
just like on normal tensors, `tensor.record_stream` on a view tensor which has shifted storage offset should record the stream to protect against unexpected reallocation.

pytorch would build without en error.
i have successfully been able to do this before (did this to get the latest quantization features that have not yet landed in master to test out the code in our new quantization tutorial phofhyperlink we hope to land with 1.3).
in my opinion, the behavior should be similar to numpy's unless numpy has a bug instead.
one process, more threads, higher cpu usage.
`torch.bernoulli(input)` should always return "0" for every 0 in input.
i expect that setting to the index of a specific gpu and allocating tensors by the `device` name returned calling have all memory allocations and computations happen on that specific gpu.
the crashing assignment `a[[true]] = torch.ones(1, device="cuda")` should either work, or at least raise an informative error and not crash.
`import torch` does not error out
there shouldn 't be any error when running the code above.

no extra nodes being generated when exporting to onnx while using `size = x.size()[2:]` or `size()` inside forward.
`[channel(torch.randn(1, 3, 3) > 0) for _ in [0, 1, 2]]` is expected to be `list[tensor]` but is inferred as `list[int]` by jit.
inference is done in separate thread with no increase in memory
better error message (ideally with individual fields names that mismatch) would be nice.
this behavior worked fine with the old api of scriptmodule: phofcode or with another method: phofcode cc @su
there should be no data type conversion
output should be `tensor([0, 1], dtype=torch.uint8)`
it shouldn't crash, but it crashes.
very likely lazy initialization gone wrong.
as far as i know, everything should be good if i followed the instruction correctly.
i also tried to reproduce the error in my local windows pc.
but no errors showed up
- the traceback should give more direction in terms of the error location.
- the above code runs.
- comments should not affect the ability of `torch.jit.script` to compile the code.
model should have been loaded without any error
nccl backend should support the bool datatype.
current workaround fix: change the datatype to int by doing `.long()` before broadcasting.
an exception should be raised
should be able to select the cuda version.
i was expecting torch.eye for bool to be implemented for both cpu and cuda.
maybe there are other torch functions with this issue as well?
if you run the script above with you will see in the good case, shown below, `n0` and `n1` read from memory.
i expect it to work in cuda or to not work in cpu (without a call to `sum`).
expect either command to work independent of using or not.
computing hessian-vector product should be x2 to x3 times more expensive than gradient since they all manipulate building back propagation graph of the same scale.
but as the log output, the 2nd back propagation process which computes hv is much more expensive than computing gradient.
is the phenomenon due to inefficient support of autograd.grad function in pytorch?
rpcagent group should be able to always join successfully.
for both code snippets, a.grad should end up populated.
expect to generate torch script.
it should be a similar speed to the second version (workaround)
i would expect the speed of conv2d to be identical whether using w1 or w2.
1. should return `(9,9)` instead of `(9, 36)` 1. should return `(18, 9)` instead of `(18, 18)`
the gradient calculation and the resulting actions array really should have been the same.
i 'd expect `torch` to raise an exception saying a dependency isn 't installed, rather than an `importerror`.
i would expect `torch.hub.load` to check `dependencies` in `hubconf.py` before executing `hubconf.py` and actually loading in the entrypoints.
it 's not clear from examples of `hubconf.py` that to avoid this behavior you 'd have to wrap all your entrypoints in functions that import the dependencies within the function body and not at the top level.
this is a pain as it involves adding a wrapper for every entrypoint and duplicating all docstrings.
i'd expect the gpu to be faster, or at least of a comparable speed to cpu.
the assert in above code should all pass.
the comment must be add out the `if not log_dir` in : phofurl phofcode something like : phofcode
the training should not exit with a segmentation fault.
tensorboard shows the correct device.
ihope the phofcode function in file phofcode can deal with the voc dataset
successful run (script exits without error)
no debug folder unless requested or an ability to ask for it to be removed (release mode?
`with_torch` should run and exit cleanly, like `without_torch`.
y[0] = yy[1] believe the issue due to the reshaping of q,k,v in torch (lines and as a consequence the softmax at line 860 in the same file.
i expect `selected2` to be the same as `selected1`, but the result does not seem so.
we can see that the indexing array is both boolean for `selected1` and `selected2`, so is it better to get same indexing result?
it should just return 'completed'.
for cases such as the one above, would expect the restart to occur at the 8th iteration/epoch (index 7 above), but instead occurs at the 9th iteration/epoch (index 8 above).
this is probably due to resetting of last_epoch in init, since it resets last_epoch to initial user given parameter value, despite fact that call to super() init sets it user given parameter value + 1.
batch should have the same dimensions as a slice of the dataset, as it happens with dense tensors: phofcode output: phofcode here we see that the batch dimension is the same as dimension taken directly from dataset.
a much smaller amount of memory should be consumed.
should produce no error as called in the following order: phofcode output: phofcode
i would expect `expected_dw_dx == dwdx` in the example above.
the mean should be sum()/#elements = both the cpu and gpu mean values are incorrect for xavier, on the x86 linux box the cpu mean is correct.
only the necessary parts of mmapped files should not load into memory.
expected behavior is simply that the qnnpack tests should be skipped when running on ppc64le.
the graph could get for the `deeplabv3_resnet101`.
expected: tensor([1, 8, 5, 3, 9, 0, 2, 6, 4, 7]) but i got: tensor([0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 5, 7, 4]) i am not sure whether it's a bug.
i would expect that i could run images, or data through the converted model in c++ and see the segmentation results.
i expect the model to only have 7 layers (without the dropout) when exporting, especially because it 's in eval() mode.
well, specifying output tensor shouldn't change the output value.
we need to either 1) re-allocate tensor to properly store output value; or 2) error out.
the speed of fp16 is much much slower than fp32.

i think it 's better that x 100] and x[-100] have the same error message.
my way to solve this is to chage [these lines phofhyperlink like this.
batchnorm1d working the first time around.
either one of the following: - `cdf`, `icdf` and `log_prob` fail consistently for native python inputs across all distributions - returns correct log_probability when given native python inputs.
loss reduces as training take place, but should not go below zero.
can run the code without error
model being saved successfully without error message.
i would expect that it would be allowed to have complicated logic in a module, in which a single case would be that two attributes happen to be the same.
that snippet is working under `torch.__version__` : `1.0.1.post2`, installed in a conda env, it seems that there it 's able to parse to onnx since the output is: phofcode under `torch.__version__` : `1.1.0` the error would be this one: phofcode and in a fresh conda env with pytoch installed from master with commit and `torch.__version__` : the error for the upsample_bilinear2d is: phofcode and according to #20116 error should be fixed on master
the script should have been executed until the end.
however, the script gets stuck at some random position where one of the processes is closed by the system, but other one is still running waiting for others.
i tried with both apex ddp and pytorch ddp and error persists.
error message saying: `runtimeerror: invalid argument 0: sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 1. got 8 and 9 in dimension 2` rather than `runtimeerror: invalid argument 0: sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 1. got 4 and 5 in dimension 2`
`topk1` needs to be at least as fast as `topk2`.
backward graph is recorded as expected with both cuda and cpu tensors.
building with openmp is working in the same environment.
it should not need so much memory to run a single conv2d op or let us control not to use the memory heavy algorithms in cudnn.
this procedure worked a few weeks ago.
we should be able to recognize this if we pass in fusioncallback & symbol in our nested loop.
executing the same cell twice shouldn't increase the memory required
the `nn.module` loads the sparse tensor from the state dict.
the `id` of `a.storage()` and `b.storage()` should be same in version 0.4.1. i am not sure if this difference will cause any hidden issue.
i would the first three layer change like there is no 4th layer.
the first three layer are croped and resized and not zero since all the single entries are > 0.
system memory usage should stay roughly constant.
see output of the code, only no `cuda` tensors and `use_cuda` kwarg is not set.
model should back-propogate without segmentation fault.
the print-statement should not have any impact on the output of cholupdate, which should always produce the correct result.
values should be deterministic and not produces `nan`
the computation time should be roughly similar with or without padding.
the gpu variant should be at least as fast as the cpu one.
this is an elementary matrix operation and gpus should be fast at that.
line 686 of lr_scheduler.py should be modified from `raise valueerror("expected integer t_mul >= 1, but got {}".format(t_mul))` into `raise valueerror("expected integer t_mult >= 1, but got {}".format(t_mult))`
export of graph to onnx format using reference to onnx 's one_hot.
in order to be able to feed variable length input to an rnn and export it to onnx, support for either or a tuple with 4 elements (the 4 attributes a `packedsequence` has) is needed when tracing rnns is needed.
when i used 8 v100 gpus to resnet50 with ddp on a single node, the time of one epoch was shown in the table.
| version | total time /s | data loading time /s | ------------- ------------- |------------- pytorch 1.1 2012 305 pytorch 1.0 606 42
first of all, no segfault should happen.
secondly, pytorch shared libraries need better isolation of exported symbols.
i think that this issue is related to pytorch not pyarrow since pytorch exports some weak symbols with defaults which replace symbols defined in `libstdc++.so` as showen in the section _additional context_.
the code could run successfully without throwing error.
mkldnn tensor can be saved via `torch.save` and later restored via `torch.load` (with layout preserved as torch._mkldnn, but without preserving the mkldnn internal layout
i think the result should be [0, 1, 4, 8, 15, 26, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 21, 22, 29, 30, 31, 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28]
all storage operations should work regardless of which cuda device is the default.
gradients are all close (match) on gpu.
it should create a tensor which contain the values from the `std:vector`.
expected numpy-like behavior: input: torch.tensor([0]).int() < 0.5 output: tensor([1]) - pytorch 1.0.1 - ubuntu 18.0
manually batching: phofcode output: tensor([[-1.7040, 1.0375, -5.7181, -4.8389]]) ``
look into the system monitor, the related python process's memory should be stable.
but in fact the memory increase over time.
sample from a multinomial distribution on cuda and cpu tensors.
performance should be exactly the same.
the first output should equal the second output, but instead, we get: phofcode
should allow to add optional arguments to the function and should not break bc.
the three functions should result in the same gradient, but function `g` results in no gradient.
when `einsum` is followed by `clone`, the gradient reappears, as in function `h`.
the `base_lr` parameter to cycliclr should override the parent class implementation of the learning rate.
cycliclr should ** always ** use the base_lr parameter specified, and not rely on what 's present in parameter groups.
i would expect the following graph instead: image phofimage
i'd expect torch and numpy to not be so different.
the print statement should be invoked only once.
i would expect the code to run, because it executes without problems on cpu (or, in case, when the issue is as well affecting the cpu, to throw identical exception with better explanation what is wrong)
using modulelist in ``__constants__`` should work even if ``weak_module`` is used instead of ``scriptmodule``.
i expect it to build cleanly.
i expected it to compile cleanly.
basically, the `ans` and `ans_dp` should be same, but `ans_dp` i.e ans in case of data parallel model doesn 't seem to be correct and something which is not expected out of `index_add_`.
this is probably happening because `dataparallel` splits the `index` and `t` along `batch_first=0` dimension.
and when they are used for index_add_ the indices do not line up as expected and hence the problem.
libtorch should be added without linking errors with opencv.
please include the proper header files in the zip, my code was working with an old caffe2 build.
the first line in should be: `set(package_version "1.1.0")`
the assert statements should be removed when `__debug__` is false.
please refer to phofurl and phofurl .
according to the pytorch documentation phofurl the value should be [2.5, 2.5].
should produces the same results as the reference (or the gpu version) here.
there should be no hardcoded path inside cmakelists.
but the main process hangs when it tries to join the pin memory thread indefinitely during dataloader iterator 's self-destruction process, while the pin memory thread is still reading the queue indefinitely.
many times it works without hang.
but it indeed occurs fairly often.
expected: a concatenated tensor with lots of ones
summarywriter should correctly output logs, tensorboard should properly read them.
when using a stride of 1 and large kernel size, the fft implementation is much faster than the default one.
the fft one takes 160ms whatever the size of the kernel, versus 3.3 seconds (resp 6.7) for default one with a kernel size of 1024 (resp 2048).
for large strides, cudnn implementation is competitive or faster as expected (the fft only has an interest if we want convolution for all positions).
i would expect cudnn to provide a fast implementation for large kernels with low stride, which can be especially useful in audio (filters implementation).
when talking about this around me, most people were surprised as it has been announced that an fft based implementation was added to cudnn.
phofcode this pytorch code converted to onnx should both set (0.229 / 0.5) and (0.485 - 0.5) / 0.5 to the same data type
summarywriter should correctly output logs, tensorboard should properly read them.
i expect that the jit version requires the almost same amount of memory as the non-jit version.
deterministic inference time, as if you run above code on geforce 1080ti.
no error should be reported
the docker of pytorch should have cuda to run training efficiently.
pytorch should be installed without error.
the message should not be shown or there should be a documented way how to suppress it.
the messages "waiting 5 seconds."
and "done... notifying threads to stop" should print and a return code of 0. i actually get phofcode 80% of the time (can be increased by adding more threads).
the image should look great!
obviously there are plenty of examples out there(e.g., opencv, pillow,...).
profiling works, not throws initialization error.
torch.norm and other result should give similar result
when add a parameter group to the optimizer, the `min_lrs` attribute of the scheduler should be updated to avoid this error.
there are some `nan` in diagonal of sine and `cosine < 1` behaves strange.
i am wondering whether there are some tricks about storage i don't know.
as code said: phofcode the size of output is expected to equals to [1, 1, 6, 6], but the result is [1, 1, 5, 5]
>>> a = torch.arange(10) >>> mask = (a < 4) >>> a[mask][1:] = -1 >>> a tensor([0, -1, -1, -1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
both constants should be exported to the same type in the onnx graph, preferably float32.
trace should only warn, or ask a special argument (something like `torch.jit.trace(model, dummy, ignore_hooks=true)` )
produce onnx_predict_net.pb and onnx_init_net.pb successfully.
so i found that the reason for this error is: input(1) is int64 type (which is set in onnx_predict_net.pb with constantfill operator and dtype=10) but we only need int type.
we can fix this issue by modify file: phofcode
expected pytorch result (a) to match numpy result (b).
the jit version and python version are expected to generate very close results.
get "runtimeerror: no grad accumulator for a saved leaf!"
in 1.1.0. but it 's ok in 1.0.1,or with torch.jit removed in 1.1.0.
the test case should pass
i was expecting an error message like in tf
produce onnx_predict_net.pb and onnx_init_net.pb successfully.
so i found that we can fix this issue by modify file: caffe2/onnx/backend.cc phofcode
i would expect the gpu code to be much faster and not spend so much time on memory allocation
the machine should not grind to a halt.
it should probably obey the max_jobs environment variable used elsewhere, and have a reasonable default.
expected build script to complete build
the results should be consistent between the saved and loaded
batchnorm works with different types of input and parameters.
runtimeerror: cuda out of memory.
tried to allocate 2.00 mib (gpu 0; 15.90 gib total capacity; 13.49 gib already allocated; 1.56 mib free; 1.87 gib cached)
pip should be able to download the package matching the url 's cuda version from pytorch.org.
performance of the nn should be consistent when indexing the same tensor.
as soon as the data is split into 3 tensors the performance is fine as expected.
performance on cpu for a single large tensor is also fine.
no performance dropoff should occur when accessing a single large tensor in gpu memory.
should lint without error currently generates: phofcode
the result of `list(ex.map(net, [input_data]))` should not have a `grad_fn`.
either a python exception should be raised or it should be a no-op.
either clarification in the docs and in the code that indices tensor has to have the same backend as source tensor, or fixing the runtimeerror.
in case we want to disable indexing with a different backend, it would make sense to disable it for forward indexing operation too, right now forward would be fine, but backward will through a runtime error.
in torch 0.4 the time it took is ~5ms (aside from the 1st iteration), and ~25ms when setting non_blocking=false.
as of torch 1.0 up to nightly the time is ~25ms regardless of the non_blocking being true
behaves nicely with large numbers for step size
i expect the scheduler not try to access the `momentum` key if i've told it not to cycle the momentum parameter.
the error seems to be due to a minor indentation mistake here: phofurl the instance variables `base_momentums` and `max_momentums` are only ever accessed if `cycle_momentum` is true.
thus the two lines where they're being should be indented.
should work based on the description of forward references in pep 484 phofurl cc @su
i would expect to be able to load a tensor from the pytorch dump in the c++ program.
the numpy version, on the same machine: phofcode
cat() / stack() accepts lists or tuples of #tensors
no initializer for the user-provided input of the model.
pytorch1.1 should get the same training speed with pytorch1.0.
there should be no memory leak, just like when training on cpu, or using the `_batchnorm` modules.
the same one that i have when not setting n_workers parameter.
pass at_assert(module != nullptr); in
should not give an error.
expected to build and link fine
i think that it is expected that, no matter which of the three ways i described to do the in-place modification of the tensor, `a` should have been modified while it is not.
if i use a single mask, then everything works just fine.
if i try something else such as `a[0][0] = 17.` or `a[0, :][0] = 17.` then everything is working (but notice that the slicing is not done with a mask (or `torch.unit8` tensor) in these two cases.
one way to work around this issue using another tensor: phofcode
if dtype of b is torch.uint8, it works normally like: phofcode if i change dtype to torch.int64, it woks differently like: phofcode it seems that the value of slices act as slices instead of the position of no-zero elements
i expected all of the outputs to be zeros.
however, on rtx 2080ti, i get some output like below: phofcode as a reference, on titan xp, the results is phofcode
i was expecting an error message like in tf
at least we should have consistant values of the two, right?
in the old version 1.0.1, if we follow the previous convention putting the `lr_scheduler.step()` at beginning of each iteration, output values are reasonable and consistant: code: phofcode output: phofcode
this will be issue, how i can fix it?
the torch package should import...
expected to convert without issues
when using as the tag for a scalar we should see the scalars plotted on the same chart.
this allows for train and test loss to be plotted on same chart for instance.
instead we get a new header <group > with two charts <id >.
note: my assumption is that this is the way tensorflowx used to work.
i was expecting almost the exact same output as pytorch 1.0.1. the only difference would be that pytorch 1.1 should start with `last_epoch = 0`.
no error, print(x) yielding: tensor([[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0]]) according to said tutorial.
i expected to see the aforementioned dimensions filled with `1` if it 's possible, or an exception that says a value error.
running phofcode should instantiate a `myfloattensor` as subclass of a `torch.floattensor` and should output the same as calling phofcode running phofcode should instantiate a 2-element `mytensor` as subclass of a `torch.tensor` and should output the same as calling phofcode it's possible that pytorch tensor types weren't intended to be extended, which would be quite unfortunate.
i would argue that it be possible to subclass them, and doing so would be quite useful for me in my research.
but in any case, attempting to subclass them never cause segmentation fault, and that usually seems to indicative of deeper problem.
verification step should pass with no errors.
observing this behavior since updating pytorch to 1.1
being able to use and import pytorch
limitations on precision are consistent between sparse and dense implementations of embedding/embeddingbag.
i'd expect it to be 1 :)
i should get the onnx format of my model but getting error
i think the error message could be clearer.
when i saw this error, it was very unclear what could cause.
i expect the better solution would be prevent linear blocks being created with an output dimension of zero.
it should compile the class.
in running with hard.pt, i expect the code to run without any segfaults.

training should either proceed despite the (perhaps nonsense lr), or should fail in a way that more obviously indicates what 's wrong.
it should proceed normally without nccl error just like in 2-gpu + 2-node case
`y1` and `y2` should be equal.
grad is not none and `x.grad` is the same as `x_view.grad`
the test will test in autograd mode and in jit autodiff mode, the autograd mode works fine, but the jit autodiff second derivative gives the above error, which i think it related to our autodiff infrastructure early release one of the leaf variable
both packages should be imported normally.
same results or at least an error
i expect that "changing the content of one (via set_) would change the content of the other.
", as per the documentation.
expected the example application to build
ftz is set and the script runs fas
expect similar execution time: conv2d should take a fixed number of flops
build shall pass with no error.
code prints phofcode actual behavior: code prints phofcode
the model size should be the same across the execution, right?
i would expect that the network could improve accuracy during training, but it does not.
so, when i want to load a model with lstm using c++, how to deal with the hidden state, and how to avoid core dump?
works when loaded from one thread without having to wait for some random time period to prevent race condition.
the `activations` attribute value should match the case specified in onnx spec.
`isinstance()` should return true in the code above.
it does not seem to be possible, however.
if then, i think that torch should provide `torch.isinstance()` or any method to support weakscriptmoduleproxy.
for instance, when doing `ld_debug=libs python -c "import faiss" 2>&1 | grep libcudart`: phofcode

lines 3,4 (instance norm, group norm): throw the same error as line 5 (batch norm)
a error message similar with cpu tensors should be given to warn about the unexpected input.
model is exported to onnx
the plan cache should be context-aware and add a new plan to the cache for the cuda context associated with the 2nd gpu.
you can simulate this by setting phofcode before the `for` loop to verify that cache is at fault.
alternatively, separate caches could be maintained for each context.
not sure if that 's easier or not.
i expect there to be a way to generate non-nan gradients for weight-norm weights that are zero filled
it should raise a correct error
gpu utilization for all present gpus should rise simultaneously, whereas indenting the last line so it runs inside the `for` loop should cause gpu utilization to rise and fall on one device at a time.
the loop above should run about `n_gpus` times faster than if the last line were indented.
instead, gpu utilization rises and falls sequentially and the loop takes same amount of time to run if synchronization happens in `for` loop or not!
input works as any size
the above test point should pass.
expect `->to` function to recursively move all the parameters on cpu.
two different threads are holding two different instances of my custom made module, thus i assumed that any operations done to each of them shouldn 't interfere with the other.

<img width="1019" alt="screenshot at 14 26 59" src=" phofurl
as in documentation( phofurl `torch.equal()` must check if two tensors have the same size and elements.
as seen in the code above, the cpu gives the result of 1, when the actual result should be 3.
the standard deviations of the outputs is expected to be zero if the results were repeatable.
in particular, copying the network parameters multiple times should yield exactly identical results (rather than machine precision values).
phofcode to import torch successfully
calling should produce `corrected_deriv` in `mat.grad`, not what is currently going there

the memory usage should be relatively the same in the first pass through the training loop, and all following loops.
the results should be the same on repeated evaluation.
weights correctly loading and model works
if i made a mistake somewhere then a more descriptive error message that allows me to continue to resolve the issue.
batchnorm2d 's `momentum` should have proper value.
`torch.logdet` should be more similar to sum(log()) than to log(prod()).
the serialization methods of pickle and pytorch should work in similar ways.
without dataparallel it works without any error thread count was under 10 when checked in the parallel_apply.py
links to what is required
the expected behavior should be a warning to let the user decide if they still want to use this padding mode for images.
i expect the embedding of an entry to only change after it was part of a back propagation chain and stay the same otherwise.

the underlying `c10::error` should be raised in c++ and surfaced to the user.
the scalars should be represented as tensors of type float for the add and pow operators from lrn in symbolic.py.

i would imagine that for most use-cases clamping the sample (after the sigmoidtransform) between eps, and 1-eps would be more beneficial than producing nans.
compute the proper loss and gradient (which would point in the direction of less "blank").
function gives correct results with tensors of arbitrary shape.
should have identical behavior w/ and w/ inplace and print only 0's: phofcode but for `test_inplace` getting: phofcode last 2 rows sometimes 0's sometimes non-zeros.
1. output of `python reproduce.py`: | rank=1, size=2, device_name=cuda:1 | rank=0, size=2, device_name=cuda:0 epoch=0, rank=0, batch_num=0, x_shape=torch.size([1, 3])
with dropout=false for the convblocks, the gradients for cnn.x look okay.
phofcode with dropout=true for the convblocks, the gradients for cnn.x look a lot bigger.
(note, i tried setting dropout=true "fcx" (fully connected) layers but gradients did not blow up in same way).
i 'd expect the tensor to be moved to the caller and the `future.get()` call to return.
the .pt file should be saved.
because i wrapped the above code within a `scriptmodule` class and that's working phofcode
the training should be deterministic across different runs
raise a `runtimeerror` that the types of `v` and `m` didn't match (e.g.
the tensor `y` should remain the same as before the error.
the script just successfully finishes.
number of calls to cudagetdevice should be minimal, i would argue that it should not be called at most once, if that.
caffe2 should perform similarly, regardless if host exposes 1 or several cpus if all thread limiting options are set.
contrary to this, it seems like performance is less than half by exposing cpu 0,1,2,3 vs just exposing cpu 0 to a docker-container.
original experiment exposing caffe behind a flask-server phofurl attempt at a minimal experiment to demonstrate effects: phofurl
i expected to be able to perform at least all basic mathematical operations like log, add, with torch.
also, torch.floattensor is not available.
the script should run and output images/sec data for each iteration.
gru should work when `bidirectional=true` as well as `bidirectional=false`.
training on this kind of model would be nice
- configure and make successfully
it should behave the same as the dense version of nn.embedding (aka.
successful import of phofcode model in phofcode using phofcode
using the legacy implementation, no exception is raised and the learning rates of the scheduler and optimizer are equal: phofcode
the training is expected to complete without any errors.
running the above script with `pytorch_jit=0 python3 deadlock_bug.py` works and prints phofcode however, with `pytorch_jit=1` it never reaches the "done" part and needs to be sigstop 'd.
i don 't quite understand the backtrace, or why this would happen given that there 's only two threads, one of which wants to join the other.
creating module in main thread works, but that doesn 't work as a workaround in situation i 'd like to use torchscript in.
incidentally, if instead of creating a `torch.jit.scriptmodule` one just calls a function from thread, everything works.
i expected the dataloader to work as intended.
to get around this problem, i had to save the vectors that i obtained from each string into a torch tensor inside the `dataset` class, via `self._vector = len_word_vector)`, and to fill it then with all the values, for each word, prior to using dataloader, and it worked.
expected behavior should be as is its when initializing with smaller logits, such as: phofcode
the python and c++ inference using torchscript module should have similar performance.
however, as the results from step 2 and 3, the dilation convolution layers runs ~29ms on python but ~291ms on c++.
there is a 10x slow down happening on c++ inference.
the result should be reproducible.
threads running different module instances should not interfere with each other.
we expect that the function `new_tensor` will produce always the same new tensor.
every time i run the script there are thousands of different elements between the two tensors and output is not even consistent between different runs.
i found three interesting points on fact that two different tensors are produced: - it only happens on gpu.
- if we create a new tensor inside `new_tensor`, instead of assigning same tensor, it does not happen.
- if we change number of elements or tensor's shape, it could not happen, but i did not find a correlation between different shapes.
given these observations, it seems a memory problem.
torch.argmax returns the same value for tensors that have same data in it, regardless of devices(or other factors).
i expect the code to run without hanging
the maximum absolute difference between the result of the two different `matmul` operations comes out big (on the order 10-4).
running the reproduction code on my system produces: phofcode
the above example shows 3 different versions of the same model: - `model`: raw lstm - `tmodel`: traced lstm - `pmodel`: dumped and loaded tmodel `model` and `tmodel` calculate the same output.
`pmodel` outputs wrong values + nans.
issue also sent to pytorch forums: phofurl
the tensor should be correctly copied or an error message should be raised.
perhaps it would be better if it didn't ever round to numbers more than 1 away?
(might require adjusting the mantissa)
since sort exists as an aten operator, onnx should be able to export it without failures.
the expected behavior is that an onnx model containing a sort operation is saved to the tempfile.
in 0.4 version /dev/shm is not filling up and there is not crash - pytorch version (e.g., 1.0.1 and 1.0.0 vs. 0.4.0): - os (e.g., linux): linux - how you installed pytorch (`conda`, `pip`, source): conda - build command you used (if compiling from source): python version: 2.7 cuda/cudnn version: 10 gpu models and configuration: any other relevant information:
on each iteration, the output and index k should only depend on the the previous inputs.
those gradients should be non-zero while all the other gradients should be 0. however, for k=2, gradients for all 3 inputs are 0 even though first input should have a non-zero gradient.
this fails autoregressive property even though masks are correct.
the result of this code is freememory = 6667 mb in totalmeory = 8192 mb freememory = 2852 mb in totalmeory = 8192 mb the gpu memory after networkinitrun() must be released, but we find the gpu memory is not released.
the export falls back to exporting it as an aten node, as it was not able to properly export it as an onnx node.
the verbose output expected from the snipped above: phofcode
global ops should contain valid `__doc__`s.
i believe the expected behavior of the reduction='sum' and 'mean' should be as consistent as the 'none' option (where i use numpy for reduction).
i expected `autograd` to work as usual inside hooks (`registered_hook`).
i am not sure is it a bug or smth.
i 'm just worrying, why does it behave in such way?
ww and w should remain the same after the normalization.
all default values are specified as `...`
that is, torch.cross(a, b, dim=-1) should give: tensor([[0., 0., 0.
group norm seems to reshape the input tensor and then use batch norm internally based on these lines]:( phofurl phofcode i am able to train models that have batch norms in mix precision with nvidia's [apex phofhyperlink , so i guess it should work for group morns.
the method could accept -1 as the index for the last axis
the model should be loaded successfully for inference.
thread loads the model without issue, or an exception is raised.
if one process in a distributed job crashes, all of the nodes in the distributed job should crash.
don 't cut the representation more than what the individual elements do already, i.e.
in the namedtuple printing don 't limit output length.
we only have <=3 (?)
members, so that 's ok.
the code should produce a scriptmodule which i should be able to save.
i expect you to die mr. bond.
i expected it to load the model in order to perform inference using my c++ libtorch implementation.
'ok ' message to stdout
numpy seemingly supports this only in 1-d, and not in 2-d. phofcode
an empty array that can be indexed in a fashion similar to the underlying numpy array.
the underlying numpy array shows `array([], shape=(10, 0), dtype=float64)` when entered into an interactive terminal, i 'd expect something like `tensor([], shape=(10, 0), dtype=float64)`.
the same behavior as for version 0.4.1.
i expected the model to execute correctly
random numbers over the full range of the datatype.
passing the optional argument as a keyword argument should match the behavior when passing as a positional argument: phofcode this is useful for two reasons: 1. it is consistent with standard python use, and helps to avoid unexpected behavior 2. sometimes it is useful to use custom functions to wrap 'black-box' numpy functions which evaluate their value and their gradient, and don't have a torch equivalent.
in a lot of cases, these depend on keyword arguments, and it would be nice to be able specify `**kwargs` in the static `forward` method signature.
expect same or better performance with torch 1.0.1.
that the performance is relatively consistent or predictable.
error in v1.0.x, everything is fine in v0.4.x
i expect it to work properly as on linux machine
* install pytorch-nightly for python3.7 * don't kill the environment by pulling python2.7 packages
script finishes and exits normally as in pytorch 0.4.1
i would expect to have the behavior be agnostic to the computational substrate.
regardless, returning the upper bound on nan is completely arbitrary and can't possibly be the preferred solution.
a proper error message should have been issued.
behavior should be consistent between cpu and gpu, i.e., a `runtimeerror` should be raised in the last call above.
i would expect `nn.module` to correct track the @property defined layers.
i would expect memory consumption to remain constant.
i expected pytorch 1.0.0 to be in the same ballpark as pytorch 0.4.1, or faster.
instead it is from 20% to 65% slower.
i tested on two different servers, one old `intel(r) xeon(r) cpu e5-2670 0 @ 2.60ghz` and another newer `intel(r) core(tm) i7-7700 cpu @ 3.60ghz`.
results of `%timeit` on `intel(r) xeon(r) cpu e5-2670 0 @ 2.60ghz`: pytorch 0.4.1: phofcode pytorch 1.0.0: phofcode results on `intel(r) core(tm) i7-7700 cpu @ 3.60ghz`: 0.4.1: phofcode 1.0.0: phofcode ~~also on the same server (8 virtual cores), without ``omp_num_threads=1`` i get ``143 ms 4.14 ms per loop (mean std.
of 7 runs, 10 loops each)`` for 0.4.1, and ``4.05 s 126 ms per loop (mean std.
of 7 runs, 1 loop each)`` for 1.0.0 (so 28 times slower).~~ (edited: this bit is resolved in 1.0.1)
that error shall never be printed out, but it did.
*test 1:* a return of `0`.
*test 2:* a finite, negative value.
i researched it some more and apparently `keyerror` 's multiline message is "broken" by design and apparently there are no plans to fix it, see this 10 year old thread phofurl (still being discussed these days).
but it doesn 't help that python devs don 't want to fix it.
so in it bails here: phofcode proposed workaround: phofcode so that if the exception is of keyerror type and is multiline, rethrow it as base exception and pass the exception type as part of the exception message.
cons: hides the type of error from potential up-stream try/except block pros: message is readable now.
so now looks like: phofcode thanks.
similar behavior for jitted and non-jitted cases
pytorch shouldn't crash, and preferably the gradient of x should be zero.
i expected this code to run quickly, and not use 8+gb of ram.
the two executions of the code (with and without cudnn) should output approximately the same loss values.
load success from the any kind of '*.pth.tar ' or some other extensions.
call `.continuous()` (or error out).
i am trying to compute pixel wised cross entropy loss, this works with dataparallel, but does not work with
the gradient should be accumulated when calling `autograd.grad` from inside another function.
all outputs gradients from the script should be the same.
python 3.6.7 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, nov 21 2018, [gcc 7.3.0] on linux >>> import as backend >>> import torch
i expected the function to behave the same on cpu/gpu, either returning [2., 2., 4., 4.]
or [2., 3., 4., 5.]
it could also be nice to have a way to control the rounding method in future releases, but that's a different issue.
when i do not specify `output_shape` in `unpool`, everything is fine: phofcode
zip file contains dlls, .lib files, and headers.
should be capable to compute loss and gradient on gpu.
``test.forward()`` should be executed **only once** with the ``y on 4 gpus with kwargs`` configuration (like ``y on 4 gpus``).
however, it seems that ``test.forward()`` is called more than once, with an empty ``inputs``.
we can see one ``hello`` message below ``y on 4 gpus with kwargs``, and i think should be terminated right after then.
flip should be faster or the same speed as advanced indexing.
right now i have to use advanced indexing for speed, which leads to less readable code.
i would 've appreciated an error in this case.
perhaps there is some reason why someone might wish to call mseloss with different sized arrays... but i think if the *number of dimensions* between the two vectors differs, it 's likely the user 's mistake.
i realize this is a "rookie mistake," but i promise it was * not * a fun way to spend 2 hours.
perhaps a friendly warning message could save someone the headache in future?
the script module should be generated without issues.
the code should print `torch.size([65536, 2, 2, 2])`
`best1 == best2 == best3 == 1`
should give correct multiplication results
the gradient should be 0: phofcode to be consistent with other implementations of the same function such as for example: phofcode
based on the doc phofhyperlink and consistency with `conv2d`, the shapes should be phofcode the shapes are normal for `conv2d`, `batchnorm2d` and `relu` phofcode for consistency, we should correct this or highlight it in the doc if compatibility is a concern.
should provide a simple error message like "the file filename does not exist"
i would expect a vector of zeros like in python: phofcode
the two different usage of permute() should behave consistently( both should permute the memory not only the shape)
the process with rank 1 waits about 5 minutes for process with rank 0, and then raise the runtimeerror.
this happens when other processes wait for process with rank 0.
`f.conv1d` should behave the same way as `nn.conv1d`.
`f.conv1d(x, w.t().unsqueeze(2))` should be equal to `f.linear(x.permute(0, 2, 1), w.t().permute(0, 2, 1)` or at least to `f.conv1d(x, same for `.inverse()` and `conv2d` (did not check for `conv3d` but probably it is broken too).
i would expect that during eval mode, batchnormalization is not enabled (including dimension checks)
i assume the second print statement should reference dimension 1, not 0.
these functions should never construct dense tensors.
the only workaround i found is to work with `shared_ptr` of `m`, but i think it would be nice if we could work with a stack allocated `nn::module`
cpu memory keeps increasing (`added mem` has positive value)
no error as when running in cpu.
expected `einsum` to work with sparse tensors, because it did just a few months ago.
a error indicates that the shapes mismatch.
definitely not "invalid memory size".
gradients should all be 0
option 1: prints an error when stream device and context device does not match?
option 2: automatically switch to the inner most context?
`out1` should be within machine precision of `out2` and `out3`.
now consider numpy version: phofcode the output is: phofcode note, that function `f` value and its first derivative agree in both numpy and pytorch version.
output: data after the round trip: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... but without the segfault :)
the cost should converge to some small value.
it works with sgd and in python: phofcode
correct result for both runs or clear documentation about the inconsistency.

the function should not fail.
the cuda tensor `x` should be initialized using the manually-seeded generator.
phofcode , phofcode , test program prints nothing.
the opposite case throws the expected error: phofcode
model 2 takes sec model 200 takes sec
np.any(a) should work without hiccups and without specifying dimensions, just like np.isnan(a) does ?
memory (ram) consumption gradually increases.
the execution time should stay more or less constant, the huge jump shouldn 't happen.
torch::load should not leak it.
maybe it should release previous optimizer states.
expected to raise some error like zerodivisionerror
see the `scipy` output for expected values.

`aaa[0][1].grad` should not be none under pytorch 1.0.0

`./make.sh` building all the code cleanly
the exported model which computes the gradients should be exported successfully.
it should return rather than stuck.
in torch 1.0.0 there was no error and assertions pass
x2 should not be 'corrupted' - i.e.
all elements should be zeros
it should print `tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, 0.3333])`, like the following code does: phofcode the same should be true if `[-1]` is replaced with `.max()` (which causes the same entry to be accessed, in this particular example), which is how i originally encountered the issue.
the code should run without error
it would be nice if running the code above caused a more descriptive error message that provides a hint what the user is doing wrong here."
"runtimeerror: cudnn error: cudnn_status_bad_param" and especially "std::exception" are not helpful.
the distributed operations should be able to complete properly, since they are always called by all processes, in the same order and with the same input data shapes.
the fact that the rest of the network being different has an effect on `all_reduce` is definitely unexpected and doesn 't seem to be documented anywhere.
this will not work, unless i put the first line of `block.forward` before the line `out=resd+sc`.
that is to say, this code can work when `sc` is computed before `resd`.
the code runs and the model gets trained
expect `g.requires_grad == true`, and expect to be able to compute second derivative of conv2d output.
no mountain of warnings... the callsite is here: phofurl , we should change it to use inspect.getargspec for python < 3.4 and inspect.signature for python >= 3.4. it is okay that we 'll have warning messages for python 3 to 3.3; these messages are developer-facing and i don 't think the extra complexity of using all three of `(inspect.getargspec(), inspect.getfullargspec, inspect.signature)` is worth it
either (a) torch.gesv should require `b` to have the trailing singleton dimension in the forward pass (e.g.
be `torch.size([5, 1])` or (b) the backward pass should work if `b` doesn 't have the singleton dimension.
both inputs with different batch sizes should work.
it should create a cmake project with eclipse.

running the code snippet results in the following error message: phofcode this is misleading because the missing attribute is actually `property_b`.
if the same code is implemented in a class that doesn't inherit from `torch.nn.module`, resulting error message is more appropriate since it reports `property_b` as missing.
for example: phofcode displays following error message: phofcode
i would expect code 2 to be as fast as code 1.

we would expect the two matrices to have the same result.

if one removes "script" or uses direct aten wrapper, the message is fine: runtimeerror: expected 4-dimensional input for 4-dimensional weight [10, 1, 5, 5], but got 1-dimensional input of size [123] instead ``
libmkldnn.so should be linked with intel mkl and intel omp libraries.
`gradcheck(sum2, (a,b))` fails because `ctx.saved_tensors` is a tuple, but i am not sure if it is an intended behavior.
`gradcheck(sum1, a)` and `gradcheck(sum1, (a))` fail because `func(*inputs)` phofhyperlink is expanded over the zeroth dimension of the tensor.
program got stuck when running the following code snippet phofcode however, the datasetsfolder object works `image_datasets[0]` phofcode after some debugging, it seems the dead loop occurs when the following is called phofcode it seems dead loop starts when following function is called
generate the onnx model i get the following error instead - `typeerror: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'torch._c.value' and 'torch._c.value' (occurred when translating _convolution)`
an ugly workaround is to squeeze and reshape.
i expected the programs to continue training more than ~ 10% of the time.
also would be nice to be able to use a world_size of 8
the second statement should have printed `(20, 0)`.
all printed losses are equal

the lua-torch model should have loaded in pytorch.

cpu memory will gradually start increasing, eventually filling up the whole ram.
e.g., the process starts with around 15gb and fills up the whole 128gb available on the system.
when `num_workers=0`, ram usage is constant.
expected that printed output to be zero for all.
checkpoint sequential is expected to work well with nn.dataparallel.
i set numpy and torch seeds, and the cudnn options mentioned at phofurl
it is supposed to iterate over the dataloader object.
at least as fast as fp32.
no errors should be reported, as i used the `labelcrossentropy` operator in other networks before without encountering any errors, though the pytorch/caffe2 version is different.
accuracy would not pick up in most cases, it never picked up for the validation set.
we managed to work around this problem by turning off iommu in the bios.
the second answer `tensor([0.0000, 1.0000, 0.5000])` is the correct gradient, since `a[0]` is not used in calculating `l`.
the output should have requires_grad=true so that one can backprop through it
`correct_loss` and `wrong_loss` should be equal.
pytorch is said to be working with python 3.7 in the download page, so there's no reason it would downgrade it.
one simple solution would be to implement the methods as follows phofcode - pytorch version: 0.4.1.post2 (i briefly checked the code in master and the methods don't seem to be implemented there either) - os: linux - how you installed pytorch: conda - python version: 3.6
torch wheel should be generated with gpu supported (0.4 torch wheel could be generated in the same way), but failed with following error phofcode
i would expect the `is_contiguous` to work on my `at::tensor` inside the `input_put_` method.
even though i'm not sure i'm doing things correctly.
to run and print the model outputs.
phofcode should be zero all the time, as there's no any reference for variables defined inside the function phofcode .
unsqueezing using none should work.
this is important, because torch.unsqueeze() can only be called for a single dimension atm.
expect to generate torch script.
for the above code sample, `hiddens` should contain: phofcode `states` should contain: phofcode `halt_probs` should contain: phofcode .
i should be able to apply the bitwise and binary operation to two bytetensors (in case their shapes are compatible).
cereal can be found both at step 2 and step 3.
matching numbers within reasonable precision.
args should not be required to be specified.
hope that this error could be fixed.
for the first case: it should throw and error because the target index should range from [0,class].
for the second case: the value of the corresponding index should be consistently 0 or (very small number?).
but it seems not numerically stable at all.
if you have difficulty to reproduce output, just run sript for two or three times.
if i need to manually mask out those invalid bit, ignore_index option is just confusing and should be removed.
i thought loss i got just be average or sum of those valid bits.
manual_seed sets the full rng state.
fail during the second epoch doesn't look right, if the input is too large the training should fail during the first epoch.
i was monitoring memory usage, training with smaller input used 12199mb, with a bit larger input first epoch was finished with 11640mb used and during backpropagation in second epoch, error was encountered.
i think some small memory leak is unlikely if it was case training with a bit smaller input would run out of memory during one of epochs.
i assume that cause is likely somewhere in implementation of convolution.
the convolution i use in code is equivalent to a linear layer, it calculates same output and has same number of parameters, but could not find same behavior linear layer
mode for onnx op should be `linear`, the correct dimensionality should be encoded into `scale_f`.
install should work so that i can open a python 3 console and can succesfully do: phofcode
all grads are same so that ll tests functions passed.

nn.maxunpool2d can accept none-integer stride and padding parameters as in pytorch 0.4, or nn.maxunpool2d can unpool result from nn.fractionalmaxpool2d without requiring stride and padding.

pytorch build from source such that we can `import torch`.
i would expect to be able to upgrade to a backwards-compatible cudnn without recompiling.
pytorch should behave the same as tensor.
in fact, indexing with byte tensor works: works
no errors with quasar component
the default browser's scrolling behavior should take place
the image in the q-img element should have the border radius applied without any weird effects in the corners.
not take up additional space just like in the other browsers.
`components: []` to be merged with auto result.
it's supposed to emit the property of the object.
in the example, then instead of emitting the whole object, it supposed to emit `id` prop.
it should work as before
the label should still be aligned left according to the align property
menu should open only on long-press (right-click).
chrome or another default browser opens with ` phofurl
`$q.platform.is.chrome` should return false should return true

- this.$q.screen.lt.xs should not be undefined
no chevron buttons as it was in version 1.4.1 and earlier
the dialog is not closed by pressing the enter key in the japanese ime phrase conversion mode.
this is always the correct behavior in standard form / input html.
even when a form is submitted with the enter key, confirmation of conversion mode of japanese ime is treated separately.
i think that quasar is better not to operate splash screen.
it should be left to the capacitor.
by removing below part, we can configure splash screen with `capacitor.config.json`.
even if there is no setting, the capacitor automatically hides the splash screen after 3000ms.
developers who want to reduce the splash screen time can use `splashscreen.hide ()` separately.
ability to use the library
all items should be rendered, just like it normally does in the browser.
when set to 'true', webpack should not require 'electron' or other node modules in renderer process.
instead it should allow users to use an electron 'preload' script as a static asset (to require node-modules), which the users can then use to preload node modules while maintaining the highest levels of security.
note: electron preload scripts can 'require' node modules even with nodeintegration set to false.
if someone has a work around for this, any help would be highly appreciated
getting the same format as the mask.
unless it's meant to be `yyyy-mm-dd` all the time for a specific reason ?
i expect android studio to open the capacitor project.
the "ellipsis" class added to the qbtn would have some affect.
qcolor should not close when used inside a qdialog+qpopupproxy
qitem keeps the original background colo
intersection event should fire when element scroll into view
i expected the qimg to render with a height > 0px every time.
the `click` function should not throw an error when there are no arguments passed to it.
that a form would behave like a form in a qdialog as adding a form to modal is quite common the quick fix is to surround the `<form>` element with `<div>` the docs could be updated to mention this, but i think the natural thing is to add form qdialog, so that should be fixed, otherwise users will have ask what 's wrong.
qresizeobserver size should be the same as window object size
the component should trigger the initial @load
set in the middle of the button, using `to` prop or not.
age field validation should fail, but submit notification should not be shown, as the form should not be submitted when there is failed validation.
contrast this behavior with synchronous validation: phofurl

options menu should show on click.
the values written during the boot scripts should be preserved.

please provide a method to include image in virtual table without jumping.
back to the same scroll location
qheader and qfooter should not jitter
that it would work/launch and i could try out capacitor
it should remove focus from qeditor.
- according to docs this should work as expected.
(return the content of prop `true-value`)
toast only once ,test2 shoud not be called
the `hamburger` menu must work at first time.
the scrollbar on the right should only be in the content area, not right of toolbar and footer
the avatar should display a circle no matter the supplied image, as qavatar does.
when programmatically removing a slide-item slot, it should disable the sliding behavior for that slot.
the qdialog/qpopupproxy should not trigger the reveal prop of the qheader/qfooter when displayed.
snaps to 0 in expected ranges.
same icons, if classes in both cases (in q-icon and in outer element)
only popup-show event is raised.
have the `input` event still fire even though `:readonly="undefined"`
the first input should behave like the second input.
popup box should be offset 10x10 px and be red
i think the expected behavior is that the spinner should cover the menu.
the value should have the current text in the qinput
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when click child element, only child element context-menu should appear, should not include outside element context-menu
a q-toggle or q-checkbox should update its visible state when used inside a q-menu, as it was with quasar 1.0.5 - 1.1.0
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
properties in class so they can be overridden with another class
focus to return to previously-focused element when dialog was opened, and ui appearance to reflect focused field.
the menu should render near the target component.
the component should be registered correctly
process.env.node_env should be defined, as it is shown in the documentation and default project.
global components to just work from all components.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
before the version 1.1.1 release our post-install script would use quasar 's css file along with our own less based style sheets to create one css file.
so i expect to be able to combine less and css style sheets into one css file.
i was expecting to display loading at least on 2nd call of loading.sho
the screen plugin should detect the platform (it can do that via request headers analyzing) and use a better heuristic to determine which size we have.
i'v checked out the code and its doing this: phofcode (making `$q.screen = this` defaults to mobile sizes)
the horizontal scrollbar doesn't appear.
the qtable recalculates the column widths correctly.
the icon does not cause problems.
the input field reflects the model.
the default test of the <title> tag to be run to completion, ie home/init.spec.js
as for version 1.0.5, also version 1.0.6 should resolve devserver proxy, and return content in `login.json` file.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
typically, when user type inside a form, he move from a field to another using `tab` button.
when the user focus a `select`, he navigate between the options using keyboard, then press `tab` again to switch to the next field, etc... #3635 was supposed to fix this feature.
the icons were expected to be displayed on the toolbar.
got variable defined in electron main process
should expand to the label length (or option with maximum length?)
i expect to be able to catch changes to the popupedit 's value without the use of v-model or without the need to actually change the bound value directly.
looking at underlying code, i understand that retrofitting `@save` event might be difficult.
however, every other component that you 'd use in a table does support decoupling of `value` and a change/input event, allowing vuex state binding work seamlessly.
in short, developers using vuex don 't have many options use edit in place ux strategy without a change qpopupedit.
making a local copy circumvents problem, but at great cost (deep copy, deep watchers, change evaluators, out of sync state, ...)
after a text input receives focus, and while typing input: 1. the input remains visible 1. the screen remains stationary
that the option will be properly added
i would be able to set the label text color to allow it to show or it would happen because of the `dark` prop.
expect the background of the qpopupedit to change to the specified color.
screen plugin to report correct width/height.
instead, a weird empty tooltip is shown.
expected day to be in the correct week day column.
the selected option(s) should continue to display their intended label, like they do when not filtering.
the top bar appears on the first sight and the drawer doesn 't.
i expected a browser window to open up at the detected ip address.
it should always show round ripple effect with round option
expect them to have the same padding
same icon sizes as default (material) icons.
just the normal plugin behavior without any issues
on step 3 it must be something like and also it must be correct on build
the mouse cursor shouldn't flicker or disappear.
it ruins the otherwise excellent quasar ui experience.
other js splitter libraries (e.g.
splitjs) somehow manage to get around this.
copying of the dot file into the main app
when qmenu is opened the value in the qinput should be kept.
readonly cursor instead of disabled cursor thanks
the input event is emited in every option selected
i expect this be able to honour `node_modules` paths as well such that if i refer to a file in node_modules it should just pick it up.
the quasar config logic should try to get the file from boots folder as usual, if it can't find it, it should then try to do a regular import using regular node module import ie: from the node_modules before throwing an error, and should work fine.
the first input should be validated first
mark selectable options of adjacent months as selectable, and select them when clicking on them.
alternatively, you could revert to v0.17 behavior of not showing days of adjacent months.
this fits with this material design screenshot: phofurl (i left out the other bug report form sections on purpose because i don't think they describe the problem any further.
i hope that judgement was correct!
embed html code in field, format attrinute inside qtable column should be printed out
splitter model changed to 100 to "close" right pane
not losing focus when clicking the toolbar.
in the implementation i use, i render the html text in a simple qpanel div.
when clicked, it turns into an editor (for users with edit rights).
when the user move to another field it should reverse to simple div to save space.
now it works except when tooldbar is used and `@blur` event is called.
result should be when resize window to any screen size fields should be mapped to their value without missing any value in web and mobile size both.
expected `q-popup-edit` to stay open until i press enter key or "save" button
the qasar app should be shown in the hosted ie window.
the baseline of the text in the buttons should be aligned, whether or not they have icons, when used in a qdialog
it will just sit there, like a good color-selection box.
the icons should not move, as is the current behavior when q-drawer is bordered.
shrink should work at all zoom levels
the ui, logic or logging changes made actually update the app.
seeing my spa alive as told in cli `localhost:4000`
one option pick operation only triggers data change once.
menu should appear when `.show(event)` is called on it
same as pwa but in a cordova app.
os: linux node: v10.16.0 npm: 6.10.11
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it should pass the options through to the emulator.
it should be equivalent to starting the emulator directly like so: `emulator -avd pixel_2_api_29 -dns-server
i expect the header to be locked to the top of the view when the keyboard pops up.
level 2 to be visible once level 1 is visible.
not sure how it could be fixed because i 'm assuming it 's impossible for the inner `qslidetransition` to calculate a height when it 's inside the collapsed outer element.
if there was a way to conditionally disable a `qslidetransition` animation (so it just lets the child `v-if`/`v-show` do its thing) then that could help because i could disable the inner transition based on outer condition.
since it 's hidden anyway, animation is not necessary: phofcode or if a new prop is not desired (it 's bit of an edge case, i 'll agree), perhaps if duration is 0, height calculation could be skipped since animation effectively useless at that duration anyway?
then it be used like: phofcode then that would just like performance tweak that also happen to used as workaround.
the computed haserror should be in the json as the return of validation tests.
and error and errormessage as the prop used to input the external validation data.
"simple div" in the codepen example.
when expansion item's active prop is true, it's expected to have the active-class prop also.
there shouldn 't be any error that interpolation is supposed to happen as the component use that string instead of when rendering.
slide action should work even if a route is specified.
based on the plugin installation function phofhyperlink , the typings to add should probably be: phofcode i'm not sure about the types of the properties, that's why i just put `??
the toolbar have a shadow around her
the filter should get invoked on any key press
platform should detect browser as edge
the menu has the "origin-bottom-right" class applied and the scale animation originates from the bottom right
it should not try to focus if the input does not exist.
finish compilation/build, start browser etc.
instead of giving an error message
field standout should be within the field itself or, if it pops out, in the center of the screen with the classes specified on standout property
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
show material icons on both modes, development and production
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
bootfiles should be executed consistently on page refresh across all browsers including ie 11.
click events have been trigger both.
i try the mouseover that can't work too.
the space would flex depending on the content of the bottom-slot.
the notification does not wrap unless the screen size forces it to, which is consistent with other browsers.
only show label, never display value
emitted value on lazy model value change (after user slides then releases thumb)
menu should display in default-header slot when drop down button is clicked.
just like it does when clicking on the drop down button in the default-body slot.
this behavior should not happen obviously.
in my case, the filterfn call and ajax fn to an api.
so i would like to save some http request.
no errors on typescript language server.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the back button shouldn 't close the dialog.
the drawer contents should be shown
should stop accepting input when user input is longer than input mask.
to not need make all reducers global, it will pollute the app.
for it to build successfully.
the id prop and any other un-used prop should pass through to the anchor element.
the type of the `dropdown.toggle` should not make `onclick` prop necessary when using a custom component with a non-optional `onclick` prop.
active dialog(modal) should not have `aria-hidden=true` attribute
the `card-header-*` class should only be added to the `.nav` if the `<nav>` is inside a `<card.header>`.
should focus first tab within the tabbed navigation
by default the role=tablist should be applied and a can be changed by passing in the role prop into nav element
it should only have a role of group if there is more than one value.
macos chrome 77 react-bootstrap version: 1.0.0-beta.14
it should be possible to embedd multiple form rows inside a collapse transition
there should be no typescript errors.
there should be no typescript errors.
the example i gave should be a valid legacy ref, i think.
i also tried setting it to a string ref and `react.createref()` but they both produce errors.
we should just omit "stateless" and describe them as "function components".
`border-bottom` should have the same style as other borders when the first child is the only child.
`first item` -> `second item` : left to right sliding `second item` -> `first item` : right to left sliding
the radio button next to "two" should appear checked when opening the menu the third time.
the old radio button still appears checked.
the size attribute be passed to the html `select` element changing the behavior to a multi-line single value select
i expect the menu to open up as many times as i want.
i 'd expect that link to take us somewhere with more info.
presumably it should go to phofurl or phofurl
no warning caused by using tabcontainer.
either there should be a warning in the documentation not to use the tabs nav variant with the flex-column css or there should be a way to define which direction the styling should be applied
the `nav` element should have a `role` attribute of "tablist".
eventkey should be 'any' type instead of string
`aria-labelledby` gets passed through to the root div of the `dropdownmenu` component and overrides any default behavior.
tab does not get rendered as a button.
the carousel should navigate to previous slide on right swipe and next slide on left swipe.
the expected behavior is that `event.target` must refers to the button that submitted the form, so that when i receive the event object, its targets attributes should refers to the following: 1- `event.currenttarget` refers to `<form>` element, since it has onsubmit listeners attached to it 2- the `event.target` refers `<button>` element that was clicked.
i was expecting the toggle button to remain where it is.
nav.link, link and navlink should initiate the collapseonselect action and close the collasped menu.
1) expected active tab to be switched 2) expected no runtime errors in consol
the `typeof` the `eventkey` received by the `onselect` handler should be the same as the `typeof` value passed to `eventkey` prop.
the formcontrol input should scale in the same way a formcontrol without the plaintext attribute does.
the checkbox must show the message "you must agree before submitting."
i can pass a ref on the `<row />`.
when a modal dialog is activated, focus must be moved to the dialog.
where focus is initially placed may vary depending on the dialogs content, but focusing the dialog itself can provide a consistently predictable user experience.
when passing the `muted` flag the `text-muted` class should be added to the element.
there should be no typescript errors.
i would expect that `onclick` attributes be typed correctly, such as when using `<button onclick={...}>` (the native button component).
these are provided via the `@types/react` package: phofurl
should go to correct page in doc
all type files should import react in the same manner
dragsource element should not be affected by whatever element on top of it.
the preview image offset should be in the middle of the image.
doing the same action in edge or firefox works.
doing it in chrome with windows scaling set to 100% it also works as expected.
the drop zone should enlarge when the second item is dragged.
drag preview should work as it working in other browsers displaying whole item being dragged instead of just drag handle.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
app should work exactly as before :)
no syntax error (since the readme page claims a browserlist target of ">0.25%, not dead", which would include ie 11).
the preview image could be resized
dropping works, even when in iframes.
the inputs should still accept dropped text
more examples that are not bloates, but connect all the important parts.
no exceptions in the console, drop event is fired
all references to react-dnd should be cleaned up properly.
offset calculation for drag preview should be modified, to solve preview being cut off.
on drop, the hover styles should be applied to the dropped item
`console.warn` when an empty string
`test button` should move along with the cursor.
bug doesn't reproduce when old version (7.4.5) `react-dnd` is used with `dragdropcontext`.
only collect function of drop targets with the same type should be called
i expect that the properties of my high order high-order component phofhyperlink are also available in `props`.
i expect that in the "copy" mouse cursor will stay since the user should not be allowed to change `dropeffect` when its defined in `options`.
the doc should provide the recommanded working way to achieve this.
the drag preview size should not exceed the draggable element size.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it should behave like the equivalent example with decorators: phofurl
the expected behavior will work when you drag and drop the very first todo.
when a user is dragging a todo via the drag handler, all of the todo should move.
it should work always, or at least throw an error when fails.
click on 'drag me by the handle bad' works well
it's expected that libraries (even if they are vended as es modules) do not use newer syntax, or that they include specific instructions in the readme that they must be run through babel in order to work.
if draggable component gets removed/unmounted as result of drop, `end` callback should not be called (or should not cause react warnings).
no artifacts or random flashes of dragged item on drag/drop.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
no error, as with `@dragdropcontext`
the `dndprovider` should use the already created backend.
for the example on codesandbox to load as expected
it will help a lot if you could release version 7.6.2 on npm.
because it can help users who use `7.x` in their `package.json`.
but if you tell me, just update to version 8.0.0, i will accept this too.
no es6 syntax in the dist file
when moving a drop source over a drop target the `monitor.isover` should be accurate and reflect whether an item is in fact over the target.
`hover` should receive a reference to an instance of `mycomponent`.
if i use react-dnd and html5-backend in project a and import this project a library in project b,and run in webpack production mode the react-dnd should run without errors.
a clear and safely way to distinguish between files and folders when uploading by dnd.
as `candrop` returns false and the drop target `drop` callback is never called, `monitor.diddrop()` should return `false`.
i've skimmed the code and the lifecycles a bit and i think it can be improved fairly easily?
i get that `componentdidmount` calls `handlechange` to set state values derived from the context consumer on `dragdropcontext`, but it looks like `this.state` is only being used for memoizing the derived values and simultaneously calling it to trigger a new render if any of dependant values change?
triggering a new render probably shouldn't be done on `componentdidmount` since evaluation of `handleupdate` will always trigger another render with value of `this.state` being `null` from start?
maybe we can set a default value somehow derived from context to set to state initially avoid rerendering at start.
i made this issue mainly discuss whether or not i'm understanding code wrong and it can't be done, or is simple fix (or we all agree this performance bottleneck needs be solved).
either way let me know if i made mistake in understanding it.
all properties from component jsx markup are passed to constructor.
the server should render the given component.
preview correctly rendered on screen
the cursor should indicate "candrop" only when hovering the drop target
the component parameter should not be null.
component should mount without error.
dragging an element around, with a custom drag layer, shouldn 't have any flickering.
does not interfere with other props.
the app should work exactly as before :)
monitor.isdragging() should work without exceptions
module should use var for apps that are not transpiling node_modules
there is no timing issue with `isover` and drop targets can be immediately removed.
knight should drop to another square
1. add `react-dnd` version `7.0.2` to `dependencies` in `package.json`.
`yarn install -force` 3. victory is ours
it is expected that touch does not work.
no error, item is either not dropping into any of targets or selects one of the targets in any sane manner.
according to documentation i should be able to do: phofcode
continuous update of the values as the element is dragged
i would like to see _just_ the bird under the mouse while i am dragging the item.
i expect this behavior because my custom drag layer returns a bird element: phofcode
i believe that cards should be both draggable and editable (just like in chrome).
after dropping, something will happend
draggable component with `drag me` text, `connectdragsource` printed in the console actual behavior nothing is rendered at all, console is empty
should look like this: dnd-original phofimage
the swap occurs without the error.
when a card element is dragged with a mouse, the console should log events when the card moves over other cards.
no runtime error in step 3.
firefox to be as fast as chrome (haven't tested it on any other browser yet)
there should be no `'dragend'` until you drop, and you should be able to drag things.
everything to work as it did in v3.0.2
there should be a print of "ending drag" after each "starting drag"
after adding react-dnd, application build successfully
something like this ::- phofurl is this something built into react.js dnd ?
::- if not possible , please give me insights into how this is possible .
no errors the main errors: `unable to resolve signature of class decorator when called as an expression.
type is not assignable to type 'typeof card'.
types of property 'proptypes' are incompatible.
type is not assignable to type '{ connectdragsource: validator<any>; connectdroptarget: validator<any>; index: validator<any>; is...'.
property 'connectdragsource' is optional in type but required in type '{ connectdragsource: validator<any>; connectdroptarget: index: is...'.` phofcode other errors: phofcode which i can mitigate by doing a cast: // phofcode
it should not generate such an error

the behavior that occurs in android which is the button expands to fill the container and the text is visible.
when i put a testid on the image i expect it to be applied to the component.
as you change the index of the buttongroup, it calls a api that fetch some data based on the value of the index
should not throw a warning/error
the subtitle would appear on the right side rather than below the title.
each type i type a symbol in the input of my toolbar, the onchangetext method call this.searchforterm(text) who made a request on a api.
this api send back an array of words.
this array populates the flat list.
if the user decide to add symbols for his term or delete symbols, flat list should be refreshed with new result of api.
it is to be installed
it should display a beautiful icon with symbol and text.
like show on the docs phofurl phofhyperlink
i can see the new letter
in android, after loading an image, the spinner should not render anymore.
change the `backgroundcolor` accordingly and do not affect any other styles.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
expect jest testing of components using rne buttons to pass.
given the style order of: internal -> theme -> external, i would expect the `type` prop to take precedence over the backgroundcolor from the theme.
for the button to be clickable.
input expected to shake when set to true.
to see the scrollable text displayed.
the clear button should appear if the value is not empty.
button renders on web, as it does on native platforms.
theme `inputs` with `containerstyle: { margintop: 16 }` and then override that on a `searchbar`.
i expected ripple not to be borderless.

- after upgrading react native elements version the badge component to display number/text with the correct shape and font size changing the badge size using padding.
i am expecting the ui to somewhat look the same.
especially, i am expecting the buttons icon to have the same right margin/padding
i expected the desired icon to show up on the right.
the onpress event should be triggered the first time it is pressed, after entering text in the input
i expect the loadingright spinner to show when the state variable is changed to true, and hide when it changes to false.
when applying any of the h1 - h4 props externally i expected them to override my default font size style that i have set within my theme.
expected to see the cancel button as i do in ios: transparent background color, just the text in it.
a switch in listitem working with no yellow box warnings
i expect the minimumtracktintcolor to stop to the left of the thumb, and the maximumtracktintcolor to start to right of thumb.
i expected the title to show up on the right of the item.
test should pass without error
the image should show correctly.
searchbar should show clear button when focused with value.
overlaycontainerstyle property was used in the past to change the backgroundcolor.
the avatar would render without warnings
should be able to access the ref to the wrapped component
i expect to rendre me the icon and card.
all the values of the theme should update.
adding multiple children without keys should be possible
test should all passed like in travis ci, here phofhyperlink .
custom fonts should work with dashed type names.

it should work and not have errors.
rne button should be clickable without red border there.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
when give the styling parameters to inputcontainerstyle, styling should be effective.

it would be great if all the buttons had the same padding out of the box without having to write custom styles.
tile component accepts jsx elements (array or object) as valid props for the caption.
expect the card to load without any errors
when long-pressed a `forminput` component, a menu should appear which lets the user select text or copy/paste text .

it should open the overlay/modal full width of the device with the grey touchable background behind it.
when i click on the checkbox, the checkbox should toggle.
i see the nice tiny badge
disabled styles should show when the disabled prop is true
that it would be possible.
i expect that once i click (or touch) on the clear icon, the text i type in will be reset as `null`.
i expect to be able to use the overlay component.
the color of the stars shouldn't be leaking out
the title should use the custom font.
i expect the clear button to show up when setting props.value to anything but an empty string.
it should work as the `react-native` slider without any problem.
when i have typed something into a forminput field and then i click a button it should process the onpress function rather than closing the keyboard.
when i have typed something into a forminput field and then click the next forminput field it should move the cursor to that forminput field so i can continue typing, not close keyboard and have my click again to open keyboard and type.
when press cancel button, the input should become empty.
when press clear button, the input should become empty.
it should still focus on search bar.
should allow unit test mocking in the same way as other operators, such as `switchmap`, `map`, and `mergemap`
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen (or code).
add rxjs-compat refference at package.json for rxjs@6.5.2
no abortcontroller exception defined message displayed
the `subscribe` method on the parent class should have properly inferred type information.
catcherror should act as a switchmap in case of error.
should return last value emitted from observable.
"of" contains value object, or change made to remove as part of a new major version change
no deprecation warning for static `merge` function with two argument observables.
phofcode as per the doc: > combines multiple observables to create an observable whose values are calculated from the latest values of each of its input observables.
rxjs should follow the conventional definition of
the subscriber should receive 2 values [1,4] and then complete.
here is an implemetation of takewhile handling this case:
i would expect the source to be subscribed again when using refcount.
after all, i can resubscribe to a completed source: phofcode i see this behavior in the source phofhyperlink code, but i can't understand if it's a bug or this is the desired behavior.
if it does, can you explain why it difference?
since ajaxobservable extends observable, it should not be a ts error to refer to `topromise` should it?
should be using just one type of source?
adding share to the original source should prevent observable duplication
`interval(0, should emit once each frame
i expected the following output: phofcode i expect that the `complete` callback passed to `tap` operator to be called after the source observable is completed (in this case bacause of take operator).
should not create larger and larger stack traces
same behavior as when not in strict mode.
optimally the call order should mirror this console output: phofcode if it is intended, that the `finalize` calls are happening after the `completion`, this would be the alternative console output: phofcode
ideally an error would be thrown if this assertion was missed, but i assume that's not possible.
so, couldn't there be a lint rule to do it instead?
the log should be called 5 times with respective `notification` (next, next, error, next, complete).
in the above code snippet, i would expect `nextblockrange` to be called after the previous `createprocessstream` stream is completed.
however, it is called every time `createprocessstream` emits a new value.
the only way i could manage to make it work is by adding the `last` operator as follows: phofcode
expect to printout switchmap function phofcode
i would expect that a warning be thrown indicating that there appears to be more than one case used across different imports of the same thing (though this may also be something better reserved for a linter) or, ideally, it just works and automatically uses the same case for all imports.
the observable should not be change it 's state to error if the error has been caught.
every window has a chance to produce values, like with `mergemap`: phofcode
well, should be discussed i guess.
i propose that takelast() to work like takelast(1) -
since i always throw an error, i never want we_finish as output.
i would expect the function only to run when the condition is met.
i expect the bundle size to be only related to the number of operators i import in this case should be
for races won via completion or error, the behavior should be like this code and subscriptions to subsequent source observables should not be made: phofcode will output: phofcode
`x.content.array` still has original order.
when using `defer` with a `() => void` factory, the return type will be `observable<never>`.
a clear and concise naming and behavior of operators and methods.
i expect for the put and post requests to be submitted open successful completion of the options request.
i expect for the put and post requests to be submitted open successful completion of the options request.
documentation in the release logs that the value property has been deprecated/moved, or the value property to come back.
the lifted websocketsubject subject should behave just like the underlying subject
i'd expect the behavior to be the same for the iterable version and the array version.
`forkjoin(promise)` should behave the same as `forkjoin([promise])`, like it does for observable.
`fromeventpattern()` should just emit a tuple of all parameters.
it's trivial to destructure that array or `map` it to just the first parameter if desired.
should compile without any issue
either one of: * not throwing when there are no pending actions * throwing a clearer error (e.g.
'attempting to flush an empty queue')
function `foo` should be called with two different variants of value `{ a: 1, b: 1 }` for the first time and `{a: 2, b: 2}` for the second
type is preserved after piping, be it a `subject`, `behaviorsubject`, `replaysubject` etc.
1. i click a button.
`clicked!` is printed in console.
as in this clear and obvious code phofcode your examples here phofurl compare common code with `rxjs` version.
you claim we should expect the same result.
but common code works well.
a new call to multiplex should subscribe and stay open.
when groupby encounters a new key it emits a group.
if i unsubscribe from that group then resources associated with that group are freed.
if groupby encounters that key again then it emits a group as if it were seeing the key for the first time.
it have to make errors before 5th line.
the filter operator does not affect the type of the observable it is used on.
the `sharereplay` operator should send all values to the subscriber that it received (even if immediately sent synchronously).
the resulting log should be: phofcode
calling `from`, with a promise that immediately resolves, should generate an observable that emit's the promise's value.
expect it to work and have the correction made for the missing semi-colon.
both tests (with `error` and with `timeouterror`) should display a stacktrace.
they either should behave same way always or if they are designed to behave differently it needs to be clarified more
only `1` should be logged
no error happens and *npm run info will list available scripts (there are a lot lol)* as described in readme phofhyperlink .
the above code should infer `observable<{}>`, instead, it throws error.
stream should go on to next tap
the `observable` should not emit until given `period` has passed.
the sample code in current behaviour section should infer `observable<never>`
code should behave exactly the same after this change.
it should infer `observable<[string, number]>
successful installation of rxjs in `node_modules/`
if there are no longer any subscribers, the socket should be terminated as soon as it's finished connecting.
the `accumulator` function should receive `index` parameter with ever increasing numbers for every emission from source like `scan` or `mergemap` do.
raising compilation error, or supporting `array: observable<t>[]` argument without spread operator would be better.
umd rxjs file will only inject global variable `rxjs` to global/window.
hope can support in mobile browser
see commented out section in the same file: phofurl i would like to stop repeating, depending on a specific status code of the response.
the solution with retrywhen works, but feels like an unnecessary workaround.
path mapping should allow whole es2015 rxjs for better tree-shaking without including any es5 code
the above code should be passing.
observable is shared and errors are the same for all subscribers.
so for two subscribers, it should look like this (retried once): image phofimage
`switchmap()` should properly unsubscribe the previous observable before subscribing to the next one.
after changing the imports (see below), everything started working as expected.
the response should come through.
should correctly output stream values.
`_subscribe()` call without error, or new `reconnect()` method to reconnect websocket.
since testscheduler is a child of virtualtimescheduler and call super.flush inside its own flush method - i 'd expect it to be able to flush output for observables that uses asyncscheduler.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen (or code).
when one of inputs fail to verify, then the submit button do nothing, when two inputs all pass the verification, then the button will be restored
in prior phofcode i can then ngfor against the property subscribed to the stream.
the observable to say it has thrown an error.
problem exist when i want to dispatch relative to status 2 different actions.
typescript add type `observable<{ foo: string; }> | observable<{ bar: string; }>` when manualy set type to `observable<{ foo: string; } | { bar: string; }>` it works fine.
doing so should result in an error.
an infinite observable makes sense if the second parameter is null or undefined but defined, nonnumerical values should be invalid inputs and throw errors.
o2$ should be of type `observable<number | null>`
i believe this should type check ok?
it does in 6.2.x, and it does if i clone rxjs and restore the old observable.pipe overload.
`tap` operator propagates strong typings for values
should be able to detect number
it should behave the same as observable pipe function and be able to compose static pipe functions separately and pass on to observable pipe.
i think can be set any number.
`console.log('map')` should execute one and only once
the `observable` constructor should accept an `async` `subscribe` function, and calling `observer.complete()` should not throw an exception.
it should work like it did in 6.2
correct typings, so the error will not pop-up.
i would expect that any deferred observable running after unsubscription would not be run.
that is, obtaining the following output from the previous code: phofcode _(no `side-effect 3` line)_ as the item(s) emitted from those observables would never be used, i don 't see any advantage to "running" them.
moreover, using something like an asapscheduler do not run the deferred observable.
when using `startwith` inside of `pipe`, i would expect either: - the argument type must match the `observable` 's inner type - the return type should be a union of the `observable` 's inner type and argument
a cookie should always be sent when withcredentials is true.
i would expect that the switchmap operator does work as before without the pipeable operators in rxjs 5.5.6
do not have rxjs rely on rxjs-compat or have a version that does not for those who are fixing their code early.
adding a trailing coma to combinelatest and similar operators should not trigger the deprecated signature.
trailing coma is often a requirements in large companies to avoid merge conflicts due only to comas.
i want to test the above code, and i would expect that after i have gotten the expected output up to the point i have it, then it would stop the test as a success.
with current test above, test never finishes, because i guess timer never stops?
if uncomment `take`, then passes.
the source is passed through `donotunsubscribe` which should prevent it from ever being unsubscribed, or at least it should prevent it from being unsubscribed from until the source finishes.
so i expect that either this test passes, or a test with `expsourcesub = '- ';` should pass (i.e.
because the default value is specified as using a string literal, the inferred type is a literal type: and that 's not compatible with the source observable 's type of `observable<string>`.
should import `import { interval } from 'rxjs'`
i expect all websockets to be closed in the end, and that all subscribe/unsubscribe messages are send.
find should unsubscribe from the source when it matches the first element.
it is not justified to hold the subscription as we know that no more elements from the source observable will be useful for us.
for buffersize=0 there should be no buffer, and if subscribed after an emit, there should be no emit on the replaysubject.
i expect them to have a type declaration
the expectation in the code above should be executed, and the test should fail, because `'z'` is not equal to `'q'`.
the test of `'y'` should be executed once, while it is executed twice.
based on my (admittedly not enormously extensive) javascript experience, when a function expects an argument and is called without passing any to it, the function behaves as if the argument was undefined.
the presence in the rxjs api of `observable.empty()` which very specifically covers the case where `completed` is called without calling `next` only reinforces one 's expectation that `observable.of()` will behave "normally" (and differently from `observable.empty()`).
an observable that `never` emits should be assignable to any `observable` of any type, since the type doesn't matter if it never emits.
this is the semantic of `never`.
when creating subject with direct subscription it receives piped values.
tests should all pass in master branch and there is no error.
when calling it will send data over the websocket connection.
what's happening instead is it's sending nothing unless i call `.next` on the original websocketsubject.
as soon as i `.pipe` and `lift` is called, i no longer am calling `.next` on the correct observable with the queue of subscribers in it; thus, `socket.send(msg)` in websocketsubject is never called.
the `error` function should be called providing the object they were found on for `this`
same behavior in other browsers.
i expected the same behavior like in javascript.
the type file should be accept empty initial arguments.
in this case the subscriber should not notificated with the initial value.
the output of `pipe` function should be a plain `observable` or expose a method `asobservable`.
the beta docs indicate that if `takeuntil` 's notifier never emits and then completes, `takeuntil` is supposed to allow all values.
supplying `takeuntil` with `never` confirms this reading.
based on that understanding: - in the `test1` example above, `takeuntil` should have allowed an emission, but at least allowed the expected completion.
- in the `test2` and `test3` examples above, `takeuntil` should have allowed emissions, and somehow didn 't even allow completions.
- in all three tests, the notifier for definitely completed before test observables were created.
my assumption is that all three test cases should have behaved identical to control case, in which a single value was emitted, followed by a completion.
this would not be first time i 've been bitten by some misunderstood nuance of hot observables, but as far as i can tell hot observable is behaving exactly as i expect it to, but is not.
that the code works as expected.
i'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature request thought.
this should give a type error like `number is not assignable to observableinput<t>`
should subscribe since there is nothing (?)
stopping it from doing so.
the error should be catched and handled by `catcherror`
it should always request when input changed.
i don't know is it working as expected.
expect that `pipe` could infer the return type based on the operators.
i would expect the observable symbol interop to be used before any other.
the source code has error when using ide to inspect.
the error should not appear.
hitting tab should show a list of matches when installing a package from `apt` or `apt-get`.
exit code is displayed as 1 or 255 or whatever
`/usr/local/bin` should only be on the path once and be in the same position as before enabling the jenv plugin.
only show the update reminder if any updates are really available.
either soft fail (1) or be able to enter passphrase (2).
i think i should be able to login again
the script should output test2_filename.txt, however when it 's executed with the zsh shell, it throws a syntax error - this doesn 't occur with the bash shell.
as seen here; += should be supported in zsh: phofurl
file uncompressed and compressed file not removed
it should update the autocomplete when packages are added and removed
in the docker-compose example above, there should only be 5 lines: phofcode ...and each line should be updated in place with "..." and "done"
i expect that tab will expand to 'gitcheckout (full name of branch).
i would like the `print -z $command` to behave exactly the same from a script as it does when doing it directly in the command line
succeed to input the full curl command.
no character should be added after the cursor and the autocomplete chooser should appear, letting the user select a file.
it shows a list of local branch names
cursor to stay on the line i'm editing
the shell executes the ls command and returns a listing of files in the current directory
the environment name should display on the command line or the line should justify properly to not create overflow
the auto-complete should work correctly.
the history should not show any artifacts.
i expect the line don't break.
prompt shows that i 'm in the merge state (master )|merging
display all matching parameters starting with `cl`
auto fill `demo-test` without 2 spaces between branch name and prompt.
<img width="392" alt="screen shot at 05 24 42" src=" phofurl
autocomplete (tab tab) then exit should result going back to the current command line without ui bug.
something more similar to a vanilla bash on ubuntu: phofcode
plugin should load without issue rather than parse errors
the cursor should remain on the same line
i want to create a file named 'file*1.txt' using vim editor on zsh.i am able to create this file successfully using bash shell.
it should accept y as an answer to a `[y/n]` question
when using `sf` in a symfony project the alias is highlighted in green.
i would expect `/bin/zsh -c nvm` to work correctly unless i've missed something?
oh-my-zsh to allow each user to install and have their own settings
on default terminal, while on zsh and using agnoster theme, i expect a clear cli prompt with light colors, readable text on a white background.
the autocompletion should also work on the cloned project.
colours to show in vim and no strange characters
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

i expect them to be joined together in one video call
i expect to see the rocket.chat livechat widget in the lower right-hand corner.
thread results should be populated.
both image1 and image 2 is shown at the rocketchat and at the widget, for the guest visitor and the agent.
with a user being `admin` and `user`, having generated an api key i should be able to perform curl queries without hitting the rate-limiter.
widget within the iframe is loading like in edge or other browsers.

rocketchat should retry forever (ideally with a exponential backoff, limited by 5 minute cycles) to get a mongodb connection.
the text that satisfies the regular expression turns into a hyperlink.
the new user should be able to log in with the credentials from the email.
to don't log out users.
i expect to not receive a notification **as-per my settings page**.
push notification to arrive within a short timing interval.
should contain a far more recent develop commit.
all avatars have normal orientation with and without accounts_avatarresize feature
if user does no already created in rocket.chat he should not be able to enter with custom oauth.
custom oauth should not create account for that user.
auto translate should work even for the new translation language.

file uploads to target aws s3 bucket
inactive users should not contribute to such a large increase in memory consumption indefinitely, i consider this to be bug since it will crash the application sooner of later.
one solution would of course be to just increase the aws instance that i use, but that 's not sustainable as it is already expensive for the amount of users because of how much rocketchat requires, and the memory will still keep increasing anyway.
this can be corrected in two ways:- 1. either hide the sidebar containing channel names etc.
a little before it is hidden in the current case.
2. instead of text going behind the options sidebar , it should resize with it .
no errors should be logged, and log should be displayed.
attachment with new message appears on rocketchat
audio playback should not be affected by the reaction.
it would be better if there was some container for that cancel button .
in my opinion the thread should open, but it should be read only
uri must be updated using the new domain.
db upgrade should not break connection to db.
the system should check to ensure the current password has not been entered and confirm it does not match the current password.
the avatar should use the first name and last name initial (eg "john smith" should be "js").
the table header "created at" should be there with corresponding sort icons when the mouse is over it.
i expect the snap to include a later version of mongo, however i know i read somewhere (pardon, i forget where) that there 's a reluctance to update the included mongo in the snap package for various (good) reasons.
so there should be a way to at least suppress the warning for snap users, please.
finally the integration and receive messages from facebook messenger
sending .cfg file is possoble with "text/plain" "accepted media types"
there should be an "a" for our channel "allgemein" and so on.
the messages on mobile app should be pruned automatically also.
the button in the parent thread to a discussion should show the number of messages in the discussion sans deleted messages.
it should add the message on the thread
info page shown when clicking info menu.
because the chat is open, it should remain in it's place in the sidebar and should not be shown in the unread section and then under direct messages / the original sidebar section.
## actual behavior: the chat moves to unread section then immediately back to original section .
i expect all notifications to respect the custom ports being potentially used.
the channel should get marked as read and its name in the channel list pane should turn to normal (not in bold).
the new user avatar should be store correctly no matter what previous avatar was used
start or welcome page of rocket chat with some text box to register user.
a user should be tied to an immutable user id.
that field should be the immutable field name.
username and email should update from field taken from saml.
this is because usernames and emails are expected to change when a person changes their name or marries.

rather same ui as when "hide avatars" is set to "false"
a ssl certifcate is properly generated after dns challenge succeeded.

on other hand, it stops in logs just after ldap disconnection "rocketchat_1 | ldap search.info closed".

this happens for example when there are duplicate keys, e.g.
there are multiple users with same email address, which might happen crowd (technical users)
i see italic _@ablesius uses emoji (emoji here)_

observe it showing on the next line below.
also private channels, direct messages and multi-user-conversations should be importable
either for the list of members to be shown (myself and the other user) or for the button to be hidden.
channel messages load properly and no error is shown in the developer console.
(possibly escape invalid characters) or custom emoji names are validated to disallow characters that are invalid in a mongodb key

character "-" should be exited like any other is, to null.
it should look nice to user.
the ui should keep its consistency.
- i would expect that the server should respect the accesstoken lifetime (in our case 2 hours).
- when a client opens a new session, if the accesstoken has expired, the rc server should request a new access token from oauth provider, using refreshtoken (in our case refreshtoken has a lifetime of 30 days).
- the rc server would then receive both new accesstoken and refreshtoken in response, which should be re-registered with service.

4. if this option is disabled, the usernames should be reset to their crowd pendants.

email header `to:` should contain the real name of a user.
the email address should fit the real name in `from:` header in an offline notification email, so that a reply by email is sent to the user's email address and not the the global `from email` set in (`direct reply`is disabled).

it justifies why having these connections blocked are important.
it should either not be allowed to edit the message, or it just should not be sent.
prefered: call continues, it is possible to keep talking to user a while reading information from user b. call status is available when in chat window of user b. alternative: at least rocket.chat warns that the call will end.
additionally there is a button to move the call to another tab so that the call can be continued.

(that doesn't require to be admin and go through the admin panel)
rocket.chat to successfully start up
the posted in the chat should be phofcode
the user should login to rocket chat, popup windows should disappear and the user should end up in rocket chat home screen.
user feedback was that this was not intuitive: the total number of rooms is not relevant to the user at all, but the unread count matters (at least more).
1. open administration page / ldap 2. option field to enter the ldap field we would like to use within rocket.chat as avatar.
gifrocket reacts on a slash-command.

either redirect... or send the correct url
user's name should be ok and contain utf-8 characters such as .
1-2 3. close rocketchat and enjoy no emails :)
rocketchat displays the given message formatted as code
previous versions showed a profile of the user along with buttons to assign them priveleges for the room.
probably a pop up to accept the chat chat functions as per normal expectations
displaying the picture in overlay.
i will not get any email for the mention, but i will get notifications on my iphone app.
for the messages to come from a "livechat guest" / like it worked before where you could distinguish who was who
channels and private groups should be merged to the single view on the left pane.
**my account** should list ** avatar ** .
** or ** administration -> accounts should give me the option to set **allow user (display) name change** to false .
`more channels...` link is presented 0584 phofimage
gets an email notification depending on what is set in account preferences.
ascii emojis should be converted to graphic emojis.
link opens up in the new tab.
comfortable visual view of chat
the quote is normally highlighted on every click.
ask user, to login to enter the private room, as it is shown with channels: phofimage
link to channel posted as link
the colors should reset to the default rocketchat colors.
live-chat should be working embed in any website i want to run it in without hazzle.
- it should be a way to link my twitter account into my user of rc; - it could be a link into the "my profile" page on the web (and the apps);
running a reverse proxy, from nginx, will just load
the api should return an error and not register the user
import to succeed, with users and channels created, and channels populated with messages.

entered text is only visible in the text box.
1. user should be prompt of custom fields on the registration field; 2.
** or ** user should be prompt of custom fields after registering the user;
after step 3. should open the channel
when i run the import that it works and doesn't go hiding in the background and run regardless.
it should show to me when i select a file and click import.
you should hear the preview of the notification sound being played.
on the list of messages, there 's a few differences: 1.
`_createdat` field should come with a `$date` property inside containing timestamp; 2.
`_updatedat` should contain a `$date` property inside with timestamp; 2.
`ts` should contain a `$date` property inside with timestamp; example of realtime object: phofcode
mark the chat as closed
piwik analytics should still be sent...

screen shot at 02 01 44 phofimage
i expected to see a single "smart quote" within a katex block, and then a single backtick following the rendered katex!
it shouldn't show both places.
(the "save changes" button changes color.)
1. go to any channel 2. write msg on channel with mention user name 3.
**send notify** to this user and let him decide - if he wants to be added to channel in that way (or some other solution, it's just my simple proposition)
not really applicable, as ui bug.
if i do the same with images sent by users before the update, the name of the file is original (except for extension in desktop app)
possibility to navigate back in browser
has to be included subject like [[site_name]] you have been mentioned by [user] in #[room].
1. click hide or leave.
invited agent is able to communicate with the admin and the guest who using the web chat.
should not enter the channel, it should simply open the pop up
i can think of two solutions for this : 1 - the "slack" way.
obviously the redesign is inspred by slack, who puts the reaction button at the same place.
but it is far more readable, because it is bigger and put in a box.
like this : image phofimage that 's good because people are used to slack 2 - "old" way.
in previous versions of rocket.chat, reaction button used to right next to time : image phofimage that 's good because it keep context : it is right next to message, so i know what i am doing.
i would prefer second option, but both sounds good.
what do you think ?
the quotation feature should also work for messages from an incoming webhook without attachement array.
file uploaded to slack from rocket.chat.
apart from rocket.chat resources, one request to login api url
should probably ignore the check during importing
not really applicable, as ui bug.
the entered user name is displayed in the notification text
either prevent/disable editing messages in a live-chat or transfer the changes to the client
either attachments are not allowed within live chats or the attachment has to be sent
after authenticating with the identity provider, the user should get logged in.
private chats and channels to be joined (based on user preferences and also "admin -> layout"
livechat title background color drop-down menu should show color options or allow a hex color value.
it should login like normal
file should upload as is and be downloaded as is with no extensions or special extension
other tab is shown (tab were switched)
user is logged in automatically due to the existence of cas session
simplified login process to work as expected
picture upload working with any type of unicode characters in any possible combination.
the scollbar background should be the same colour as the page
when setting to false in the admin panel, no email verification is in place (meaning: sending no email to an user, asking for a click on the provided link).
thumbnail should be scaled accordingly to a certain max-width.
to not remove the left panel
when you edit a message, you should be able to remove the quote.
should be "uu" in this example.
the expected behavior would be only having one item in "unread" section.
not sure :p but the buttons should be more visible.
according to the documentation, an item selection step should follow.
i have never seen it.
users just added to rooms should receive offline email notifications according to the default room notification settings which is: "use account preference".
which in turn defaults to: "every mention/dm"
single scroll on right side.
no errors is expected behavior
show if my email is already verified and if not show the 'resend verification email' button.
it should be shown, that only 1 instance is running, which is actually the case
the user is able to scroll down far enough to see the button options and start a conversation or block the user (as appropriate)
eh... nothing has to delete the rocketchat database i think... ;-)
should have an ui like this: image phofimage
gui should show values still being 'false'.
i would expect nothing to happen as file uploads have been disabled.
sentence should be natural english.
normal chat view/panel is being displayed
when an anonymous user logs off or leaves, that name should be deleted and be allowed to be used by another person in the future.
this will help also with load issues and just keep rocket chats database more clean.
i can understand that some may want to keep those stored, so there should be a way to delete them all automatically with a click of a button at the very least.
user logged in, chats loaded
for the system to log users out after session timeout
let user login into rc while ldap profile picture sync is enabled
message is sent, but not triggering notifications for anybody
members should always be able to join the channel.
to my mind "last login" shown in the webinterface should be updated, as well as "online status" if not logged out.
a livechat customer should not be able to join the backend.
full support of markdown in the widget.
the user admin should be able to manage regular users but not system admins.
the management of system admins should be done by system admins only.
incoming message from bot account be tagged as a bot
no change in behavior the following should work as it did earlier: ` ` ` text ` ` ` which displayed as phofcode
the presentation of the smilie emoticon should not differ (backend vs. frontend)
the browser would focus on the textarea, showing a blinking caret.
should prompt them to send transcript
the camera should turn off
password is not stored at all or hashed.
the new user is automatically added to (any) channel with the "default" flag set to true.
> there is a user, i should have to able to dm them
a response from the bot
seeing header line all the time
entire multi line message visible
should follow the same rules as channels and only notify mentions if mentions are selected.
only the fileupload button will disapear
i would expect login to work with umlauts in the password
the reply is addressed to `@some.user`, too.
if the alias is a user 's display name, the corresponding id should be used.
expect the username to be displayed as "firstname lastname" screenshot of rocketchat app: img_0439 phofimage
call ends and you become offline.
see (1) before the name of rocketchat instance
direct messages are not to show up in the logs, or in the database
ctrl + tab should let user select next tab.
should have loaded the rocket chat
the input present on the test page should receive a path to the `test.txt` file.
the element with css selector `.widget` should be set as the 'firstresult ' variable
for the code to compile and work.
expect jar files to be copied on to the classpath, but none are.
if you manually modify the `pom` and comment out the `classifier` elements, everything works as expected.
i would expect that sending the `command` and `subtract` keys together would zoom out on mac.
or sending the `control` and `subtract` keys together would zoom out on windows/linux.
see the script below to see all the code i 've used to try and get this functionality to happen.
i expect to see the browser console logs.
it should work start a new chrome browser
isdisplayed() should return true or false.
element should be dragged and dropped to droppable zone.
extension should load in the browser.
driver quits after a 10-second delay
its working fir in chrome version 75
the chrome process is not created when creating chromedriver failed
it should not throw any exception rather should return an empty arraylist if element is not present or locator is not correct.
when you click on an element, the click should occur in the center of this element so that it is clicked.
chromedriver.exe will not be in the process list.
expected these commands to run normally like they do in the nuget version.
webdriver driver_1 should be get attached driver_2 without exception
the lambda should be uploaded and unzipped by aws.
it should run on demand.
all the modules should be resolvable and i should be able to package and run my program.
in this case both elements are rows in a table and should be clicked and thereby selected.

edge launches as all the other browsers i 've tried do and i can then drive it via my `driver` instance.
when received an error object, it should properly propagate back to the caller instead of crashing the entire iedriverserver.exe image phofimage
exception is from phofcode the problem is at phofcode but java.util.serviceloader unable to load class which haven 't define uses at module-info.java.
adding phofcode to module-info of should solve the problem.
file should be uploaded successfully.
but we are getting the below error.
the `elem[0].text` call should be relatively fast--on the order of a second or less.
when clicking an element, clicking should occur within that element, such that it is clicked.
links should be made to phofurl rather than phofurl
error stack points at line phofcode it worked well in version 3.x.x
isdisplayed() returns true/false, does not throw exception.
let the path to microsoftwebdriver be and let the path to selenium v4.0.0-alpha-2 jar be also, let the path where i want to save log be now, when i create a session using selenium jar with the following command: :x: (doesn 't work as it is expected to) `java -jar and then try to create a session by sending a request for same, webdriver doesn 't open edge(edgehtml) browser as it was expected.
however, when i follow same by removing log file, it opens browser as it was expected when sending a request create session.
(works as expected to) `java -jar **the first command doesn 't run microsoftwebdriver and second one after removing flag for logfile works smoothly expected.
** facing this issue in case of 4.0.0-alpha-2.
it works file with 4.0.0-alpha-1.
(maybe because of support of chromium based edge)
i expect the ff test to finish.
the driver will be created, and will function, like it does when the screen is not locked, or when there is an active rdp session.
in this particular example i 'd expect a link like phofurl or phofurl
it's expected that to have the correct value.
expect selenium controlled instance of ff to be able to load up from the same profile as my install of ff.
it is expected to be able to atleast kill it so you dont end up with a ghost window, unkillable.
steps: 1) open google.com in current tab 2) collect all links with tag "a" on google.com **for each collected link:** 3) open link in a new tab via ctrl + left-click **if two tabs are open:** 4) switch to second tab (= newly opened link) 5) close second tab 6) switch back to first (= google.com main page)
the mouse should be moved to the specified offset and the hover state of the button should be visible.
if the values are nan, it 's suggested to at least honor original values instead of adding returned values to offsets which results in sending a legacy moveto command with:
selenium grid should execute multiple instances without any exceptions
install an older version of urllib3: `pip install urllib3==1.24.3` run the same test file again.
the error will change to incorrect auth which is expected behavior.

this issue was originally reported by a chromedriver user at phofurl the user 's app uses a version of protractor that only supports oss protocol.
os: all browser: chrome browser version: browser driver version: chromedriver used in the repro, but should apply to any w3c compliant driver language bindings version: n/a selenium standalone server version (if applicable):
the time it takes to take a single-color screenshot should be comparable to screenshots that are of two or more colors.
sendkeys should type entire word or text in a text field for ie browser in windows 10
devtools commands should return successfully inside a "listener".
a notsupportedexception is thrown instead phofurl after all, what you are trying to do is not supported.
this provides the user with the information they need to either work around it or remove the calls
all the whitespaces should be ignored.
draganddrop works same as when performed manually by mouse move (something is drawn).
the browser/element should receive the full key combination, not just part of it.
if i replace one line in the example above, it works in chrome 75: phofcode
do not throw an exception.
file updates state and saves normally
node is registered to grid
the code should not return any error.
it generates an error: **invalidargumenterror: invalid argument: perfloggingprefs specified, but performance logging was not enabled**.
however the log is enabled.
checking the chromedriver log we can see that the loggingprefs is filtered out in the "always match part" (since it 's only w3c compliant fields).
phofcode is this a chromedriver error or selenium or both?
it works in 3.6.0 :)

the expected behavior is a successful call for phofcode the call expects a json response from `post phofurl phofcode i suspect the issue to be a problem of absolute and relative url paths in the chrome bride: phofurl other calls to the api (like for creating a new session) do not have `/` appended.
it seems that the call is going to `post phofurl

imho this permission problem should not be visible to user unless it 's persistent.
this can be fixed by modifying to include a check for eacces: `if (e.code === 'eaddrinuse ' || e.code === 'eacces ') {`.
maybe error message in line 184 should include a note about possible permission problem.
with that fix (and some logging) i was able to see that on the second try a free port was obtained.

clear() should empty the search bar.
chromedriver should not wait for the request to end and continue to the next action (same as geckodriver)
the error should be in the body of the response, not the allow header
execution should be halted when the `eoferror` is raised & flow resumes at the `except` statement.
it will then `pass`, and continues in the `finally` statement & the browser instance is closed by either `driver.close()` or `driver.quit()`.
should be possible to create session having ** capabilities ** with appium specific properties in body, like: platformname: 'android, ios ', platformversion, devicename, udid, chromedriverport, systemport, chromeoptions, newcommandtimeout, and others.
jruby says that the above issue has been resolved in the latest version.

the command to run the node should use the "normal" network interface, not blindly picking docker or virbr0 interfaces.
somewhere on stackoverflow i read that these things are not a selenium issue but a matter of network configuration.
i doubt every selenium user is a networking expert.
please add this info somewhere to the grid documentation so that others can benefit from it too.
(also my apologies for my other bad report the other day about this, yesterday i was feverish and had a bad headache)
clicking with selenium should produce the same result as a real click.

google.comyoutube.com hope to visit foreign website, such as google.com or youtube.com and so on.
dump strings with the correct case
it should connect and start checking for the sql injection right?
but it works fine with python 2
that sqlmap saves the cookies given in `set-cookie` headers and sends them in subsequent injection requests.
`first` is scanned for forms rather than `second`.
an error message of invalid syntax.
sqlmap should not use cast if `--no-cast` option is set.
the following payload is working: phofcode result from the api: phofcode
the target site uses tls 1.2, so i'm not sure why sqlmap is trying sslv3.
i am able to connect to the site properly through tor using a browser.
the cookie should remain intacted.
--passwords should return hashes, not "null"
all user data will be updated in risk 1 level.
not timeout because the url tested is the same of the first case.
jq should not segfault on valid input.
the expected result is `true`.
compare to data with a `test` that evaluates to `false`: phofcode
i would expect the 0a to not even be injected in this example - or it should be injected at the very end of the line.
jq 1.6 outputting the same timestamp as gnu date and jq 1.5 like this: phofcode
every value in the json document printed by `jq` should be clearly visible on any linux distribution, especially popular ones, and especially using default settings.
do the stream-to-json conversion when input ends, it should output phofcode
convert a json to stream and convert back to json should produce same json as the original one.
jq should report to stdout parsed json
i expect jq to recognize the key `7z` as a string, so that no double quotes are required to access it.
a number is hardly a special character, especially since there are no double quotes required when the number is enclosed by 2 letters.
a build for several archs including arm64.
the outputs of `echo | jq -rr '@base64d ' | xxd -p -c64` and `echo | base64 -d | xxd -p -c64` should be equal.
the grouping during parsing seems unintuitive and/or incorrect here.
what the current implementation is doing: phofcode what i would expect: phofcode
the output of `jq` to specify the correct timezone following dst
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i 'd expect the result to be `null` in both cases
expected jq-1.5 output to appear in both cases
for a popular software project like `jq` (almost 14k stars on github) i would expect there to probably be a docker image.
and, low and behold, there is a `dockerfile` in the code repo.
however, there is no mention of a docker container image (location) in the readme file.
jq would identify itself as source of error.
so above message would say: jq: parse error: invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 18
the first line should raise a "normal error" not a null.
put variable without new character ' ' >
failed test within appveyor will give a failure status for the tests instead of seemingly passing.
'@sh ' should not change the exit value.
i am expecting the same error report from both cases.
the behavior should be consistent.
it should either show the help text in mintty, or read from stdin in the command prompt.
the version in `version.h` should match the most recent tag.
i should have the output of the entry number 100 in the array
for jq to output/parse dates using the correct representation of names according to the current locale
another field in the env var to override the color of field names.
using square brackets to access object properties should work the same as just using quotes.
expected: i would expect a.inner.b to exist.
the above should output not `fromdate|todate` and `todate|fromdate` should probably be idempotent.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
`useaddonstate` should work in react-native
the errors are as follows: phofcode
do not use a position relative on titles since it seems to serve no purpose
the css resources tab should be continuously populated by the specified css resources at initial storybook load and all subsequent refreshes.
storybook works out of the box directly with yarn v
the `<style>` tags should be in the `<head>` of the document not in the body below each component.
i expect the storyshots to be created and then used in later npm run test
maybe there needs to be separate packages for vue / each framework support?
render a prop that only have a default value
the content would show over the preview.
dont have a top margin when there is no description
the documentation for the props should be displayed even if `forbidextraprops()` is used.
the docs for the component story should display the propstable showing props for message, classes and testid.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
html tags should be escaped, and read, in my example : `you should not use <route/> or withrouter() outside a <router />`
typings should be available, either as a built-in or through definitely typed.
triggering an event should emit only once in the actions tab.
there should be no warning in the console when using this recipe.
or more explication on the expected config in this last.
storybook should be working correctly on internet explorer 11.
want to see some code snippets.
stories should render, or give a more helpful console error!
the docs should be embedded in the docs page: <img width="600" alt="screen shot at 11 01 47 am" src=" phofurl
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i expect to be able to make a selection from using the `select` knob and change a color.
to render the story code the same way as if the jsx element wouldn't have been typed.
no warnings should appear in console.
like it was in 5.2.4.
when the content overflows, users should be able to scroll to see it
props details should be completely shown
would expect it to list the union type.
i expect that like the alt+right arrow shortcut, the alt+left arrow one work directly ater a page load, without focusing on the canvas
i expect to see a code block which can be read by the user.
`addon-actions` should be able to be triggered in `mdx` format story like csf story or story created using old api.
colorpalette and coloritem to render also render properly in canvas tab.
since i initialized storybook like this: `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type angular ` i expect for the storysnapshot to run to completion, without error codes referencing storybook/react such as `cannot find module '@storybook/react ' from 'badge.stories.js '`
to respect the default value for each component.
my storybook to load as expected.
note that i have added no components and this is a fresh install via `npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type vue`
props table should be shown.
for example, a `<h1>` ought to be rendered as `<h1>`.
importing `renderfunction` and `renderable` works
it should looks: zrzut ekranu o 08 12 10 phofimage for now component ignores `dark` prop: zrzut ekranu o 08 03 23 phofimage
message logged in action pane.
setting the component directly via meta should be posible.
functional vue components should render just like non functional vue components.
`extractprops` will check if the wrapped component has proptypes assigned before trying to unwrap it for further check.
it 's also normal when i used storybook@5.2.4 , just like i used storynook@5.2.1 .
expect the viewport default to be set like it is with the storyof format.
initstoryshots is imported and runs in the test as passing
that the either the documentation states that the property is 'query' or that the 'gif' property propagates to search request to giphy.
host styling is properly applied and the background is red.
initial page should be "preview" or "navigator".
simulator refresh must not redirect to "addons" page constantly.
the text does not overlap.
i would expect to see default browser behavior.
to see the script working as normal.
a disable story should not be available in the navigation menu when the site is built using the `--docs` flag.
expected to see both `<p>hello child #1</p>` and `<p>hello child #2</p>` rendered
`addon-viewport` should scale the storybook viewport to the pre-defined size
proper tsconfig path resoltion that respects existing @storybook/angular@5.2.
there should be a way to pass and access environment variables to storybook webpack config.
all props should appear in the same order as they are defined, no matter if they have a default value or not.
an easy way to fix this, would be to sort the props alphabetically.
imo it would also make the documentation easier to read.
to not throw an error because of types i 'm not related to.
i am not sure, what bothers me is the "union" text, imo this is confusing for the reader of the doc.
ideally, it would be awesome to have someting like: moment | func a maybe easier alternative would be: custom | func
i would expect it to be something like: ["top-left", "top-right", ...]
nothing serious will happen because the state is not being used yet but storybook should not display any errors.
i expect it to show the code that is used to power whatever is placed within the `preview` components.
using raw html in mdx would behave as straight html
description and the props description should not be empty / null
1 story is working (no blank screen in storybook story-window) 2 no exceptions in the console.
if the specified port(ie: using the option `-p` for `start-storybook`) is available it should run without any prompt
the name of the function when available, in this case : `startswithsearch`.
when it 's an anonymous function, i suggest something like: `func` or `anonymous function`.
imo the stringify representation of the function is never a good fit since it takes a lot of space and most of the time is not helpfull to reader documentation.
i would expect it to be something like: [item_shape], [object] or [{ text, value }]
- i expect the `docs page` or the `info page` to have the props table.
empty rows are allowed inside mdx template.
when a nav link from the menu is clicked, go straight to the selected story without going back to the top of page
this not to appear in my object...
i would expect to have all my css styles properly rendered.
trigger action and show on addon page.
works and show the source code of the stories
i 'm expecting the webpack config both inside preset and outside to behave in the same way with the same configuration.
the description column for the `test` prop should include the "please work" comment as well as the "string" type.
it should look like this: image phofimage
usecontext should work and return the updated value from the context provider
expected to see the props and description.
to encode the url specific chars.
in git blame i see that encoding is explicitly disabled, but could not find the reason why: phofurl imo, the solutions can be: 1) to turn encoding back on, if there's no particular reason to keep it off.
2) to manually replace url specific chars like `param.replace(/#/g, '%23')` let me know, if you'd like me to submit a pr for it.
should be able to see mdx story of card too.
similar to enzyme for react phofhyperlink , i can customize the snapshots for angular storybooks.
i 'd have expected arrows and regular functions to be interchangeable in csf.
zooming in and out in the canvas should only impact the canvas
should log the webpack config in the terminal and similar to `info => custom webpack config loaded`
i expect to see the addons panel if i have an addon installed to be used
the cli generates config files that adhere to the storybook doc recommendations.
expect storybook to ask which version similar to what create-react-app does or have some way to workaround this if create-react-app is broken.
i expected this output: screenshot at 16 08 56 phofimage
i expect simple story with woot text in it and no exceptions in the console.
the configs in the file are loaded and respected.
i suppose they should be displayed.
i think (no research though) that people usually treat error.message as plaintext and don't relaly throw html stylized errors.
i would like to be able to add some specific css only to the stories without affecting the rest of storybook.
styles should be overruled if the documentation indicated i can overrule them.
there should not be any errors.
select could check the type of all the values provided and if all are `numbers` coerces/parse the value to a number type, like the way `number` knob does.
or could have an optional param to say `isnumber` but that seems messy
i 'd expect it to show the actual prop values.
for example: `<box selected={true} label="the label" />` is there a correct way to do this?
with the way it works currently it 's hard to define stories inside of the `mdx` file exclusively.
i expect that storybook, just as the angular compiler, will create 3 files and only attach one file to the component preview.
then, using the addon, i can add the theme files
* prop types should be detected correctly * story source should show component name
it should not have any error.
the command should not throw
always increment/decrement by 1, regardless of number of hot reloading.
i want to view my customized materialui component.
shouls work to see the expected behavior
keep scroll up at the top
should display description as expected
2. follow an example like that one: phofurl 3. inspect the request.
the gray highlight precisely covers the selected story in the storysource panel
there shouldn 't be an error in the console and and storybook should load
see a storybook for storybook 's components
as with previous react / react-native versions, the addons panel should not render overlayed on the preview panel on launch and should only show when it 's navigated to via the bottom toolbar.
stories.tsx files in the stories folder should be discovered please note, this is a brand new project and all the config files exactly from the snippets provided in the link above.
navigation between stories and doc pages should be logical (and without having to learn internals of storybook).
i would expect the url param `full=1` to be respected even if global parameters are added in config.ts.
moreover, i would expect the url parameters to *override the global parameters*.
it 's expected for the knobs to continue to update... they do not.
(final note: none of the errors in the console.log are the direct result of this problem.
i 've fixed a lot of those locally and problem still occurs).
the docs tab showing the dosctring in a nice way.
no tabs, just defaulting to the docs
the props section should be the same as it is when running storybook
both `""` and `{ ' '}` syntaxes should be supported i observed this behavior on both 5.2.1 and 5.3.0-alpha-0
should be able to view docs
the description and proptypes description should display when a component is using a decorator.
`a11y` parameters _at a story level_ should not affect other stories.
ts typing for `storyfn` allows an array of elements as its return type.
given the above example, the description for `textalignment` should show up as `left, right, center` given it was typed in a flow type
like in the screenshots and docs, code previews should be available to view and copy.
to see the documentation page
there should be a dark background for the `code` tag.
the `storydescription` should show, just like it does for any other story.
a11y addon would run the color-contrast rule and trigger a violation.
it should show both listed modules.
storybook should work without throwing an error
should not crash to build every now and then.
story converted to csf would load
the indentation (and line breaks) would be identical to how it shows up in the mdx file.
horizontal rules should be rendered with the theme's border color.
i'll be happy to open a pr for this but please let me know if i've missed something and the current behavior actually is expected
storysource should show highlight lines in "canvas" view and show code in "docs" view, regardless of how the story 's title is made up.
both the commented and uncommented version of the snippet should behave the same.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
build to run and resulting storybook to run
it works as expected with angular 8
currently, addon-docs doesn 't support showing source for jsx, which is expected.
however, it 's still displaying a message "no code available" even with `withsource="none"`.
i would expect it to not attempt to load the source code at all, and not display any message.
i would expect the component to immediately reflect the context change.
i would expect the icon to exist based on if the story uses the addon or not.
all element of the component that is rendered inside the docs preview should be contained inside the preview.
the expected behavior is to clone and bootstrap the project without this workaround: comment `weak` module in the `package.json` file.
clicking on the `mybutton` component `with text` story should log the action, just like the auto-generated demo `button` (either `with text` or `with some emoji` stories) does.
the `mybutton > with text` story click, however, does not show the action in logging pane.
i should see the contents of the template.html files for each story, only when i am viewing that story.
in other words, the above should be exactly equivalent to: phofcode
expect to alter story preview properly as stated on the doc.
moreover, `typeerror: cannot read property 'kind ' of null` should not appear
expected behavior is that the snapshots contain components that are shallow rendered
that using a csp that does
docs should be able to load files with dynamic title
working fast refresh while editing a story
it should not be an issue to have 10,000 variations in one storybook.
a 1-3 second loading time for such large storybooks is acceptable; a freezing chrome tab isn't.
work always as in v4
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
storybook loads without errors and includes component styles in the stories.
the components should successfully show.
should be able to change stories.
performance should not be impacted by the fact that the iframe switches contents.
it should have shown the stories on the browser
storybook uses the project 's `postcss.config.js`.
vue works as expected without an errors.
docs preview should show the correct components based on the story
runs js on story load and when content changes.
it was not the problem in storybook v.4.
should work normally with external `svg` `defs` params node.
only a single value is taken up while logging.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it displays the docs for `test.stories.mdx` correctly.
small components would not be in such a big div.
the story shown should be the correct one in the web browser
kind should be the component type, story should be the story name.
the story should use the same location as before to store snapshots.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
storybook does not interfere with css of the component.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
no warnings about peer dependencies
start with the navbar hidden/collapsed
the title should not include any metadata and the class documentation should be visible
i would expect the content of the markdown file to be embedded within the mdx file content.
i would expected to see my component back in its default state.
expected: all stories are present in the static build actual: only the stories that matched in the last call to `configure` are present
when following the readme instructions, not to be left with warnings from yarn.
either the readme should mention we should install these packages together with the addon, or these packages should be added as real dependencies of the addon, not just peer dependencies.
should see the text passed in (or auto-generated notes)
allow a generic type as an option value.... phofcode
the screenshots should consistent with the local ones especially since i only install puppeteer with so there is no version mismatch.
the documentation does not make it clear that there might be differences between os 's and that results might be inconsistent.
currently, for me, it is broken and i am trying super hard to make it work and to understand most the process required for it to work.
thank you for reading my issue, i 'm really hoping for a response and hope this will be helpful others.
documentation of `addons/notes` says it 's possible to use markdown external files.
i want to use it the same way.
tsx will be supported inside the .storybook folder.
there should be only one "docs" folder?
all components to be loaded and shown together.
i expected to be able to use the `css` prop from emotion within storybook.
story should render as usual without errors
i expect addon-info to be loaded without errors.
it should run storybook when `yarn storybook`
expect no peer dependency warning.
component should be shown without any issue
"no component found"box should not appear
a soft exit where the user gets informed that he needs at least one angular project in his workspace.
it also should abort `sb init` so a user can just run `sb init` again after creating a project
black text on white 'ish background.
docs addon should be hidden or display a user friendly error if there is not documentation associated with the story.
error should not be displayed for subsequent use of storybook after seeing error.
type story should allow for .addwithjsx and .add, and it should no break on build.
use `create` from `@storybook/theming` without requiring react typings and therefore no jsx namespace conflicts.
i expect that storybook will load my stories with styles.
it loads the stories in the storybook but they don 't have styles associated.
`yarn lint` result should be success
install request should not break storybook
there is an expectation that anything shipped as `dist` within an `npm` module should already be compiled and not rely on the user's version of `webpack` in order to run.
there are serious performance and bundle size issues that require `node_modules` to be `excluded`.
this is the expected contract that all npm modules normally follow
i would suggest that ignoring the enter key would be more helpful for those that have search + enter key muscle memory.
since the searching already happens each time a key is pressed.
component should continue to work as expected after changing property via knob.
storybook builds and opens localhost:6006
i expected to execute the tests and show if they works or no, and show storybook page with my stories.
component should show up inline with the markdown
when i remove csstransition the component show in the storybook, thas is what i expected.
jest should create snapshots based on stories in mdx file like it does for jsx/tsx files or ignore them.
show stories and no error
a expected behavior is it should build the app and output the build folder as below phofcode
the code below should display two select knob options.
occasionally displays both, but only one ever works.
shouldn 't storybook take the paths from jsconfig.json file - or solve it someway with full control mode, where i could solve the imports using "resolve" with webpack?
jsx will be supported inside the `.storybook` folder.
module is imported without any errors.
no warnings should appear in console.
i think this should work in the storybook environment same the nextjs environment
link to change log will show `5.1.9` (or newer) changes (/blob/master)
when renaming a story using js, storybook refreshes the list of available stories and maintains an up to date catalog of the stories that are available.
i would expect the behavior to be consistent between the two approaches.
i expected this to work.
the raw-loader module should not be missing or needed.
the component is shown as expected
the proptypes in "info" is not cut off.
expect the docs tab to show a "no docs found" message along with additional stories from mdx files.
the knob to work and render checkboxes
storybook can extract metadata from imported ngmodules both with or without `forroot`.
rendered html from markdown file appears within the notes area.
no console error should give if we are creating new project
no typescript errors from published files
nothing should have happened, i didn't do any code changes
my snapshots should not break, or at least should not render completely different output
js snippet text should be white and legible
the addons should try reuse the version of core-js that is installed.
storybook to load just like it does if i specify individual file import without trying to match / .stories .ts$/
storybook 5.1 should behave a 5.0.x
since its optional phofurl i would have expected that it will render the title instead of the icon.
to have a thin scrollbar link this one: image phofimage
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the default viewport should still be there when transferring from notes to canvas.
check if angular version is 8 and point to correct tsconfig file
i should be able to click on the add-on tabs.
i expect the backgrounds add on to show the background that i 've set as default in `config.js`
should open storybook in browser without errors
all of the identified story files should be loaded into storybook (indeed, when i do a console.log of `req.keys()`, all of the files i want are listed).
storybook works, loading modules using pnp-webpack-plugin
correct dependency declaration that does not create this problem
should see the example console.log behavior.
i expected that the storybook will run properly just like what happened in part 2 step 8.
do not ignore escaped pipes.
do not create new table cells.
the gradient background works, but i also expect the shortcut menu to open normally.
notes should be one of the panel tabs.
hide or leave empty accessibility tab when `disable: true` option is passed
tho kinds, "foo -> bar", and "others -> foo" are displayed
there is not a unknow tag aroud story source
`npm i` should not fail and should install `@storybook/angular`.
the style of the docs should not bleed down on the components showcased
it should work the same way as ``npx -p @storybook/cli sb init`` - without an error, generating files.
the expected behavior is to see the component on its own, without storybook ui, with properties changed according to knobs
it should build and display previews, just like the start-storybook.
when i do not set a theme it should reset the theme.
the text must be fully exposed, no matter what text is entered.
`devserver` options like `before ` & `after` work as expected
version recommendations for @storybook/cli phofhyperlink are clearly separated from phofhyperlink you can see that storybook thinks its version is `5.1.0-alpha.7` and is recommending you to update `@storybook/cli` to `5.1.0-beta.0`.
but in reality, `@storybook/cli` already has version `5.1.0-beta.0` installed.
on the other hand currently has `5.1.0-alpha.7` installed.
the docs tab open, and shows the documentation
content should not blink, and network logs should show no new resources getting loaded.
this can be verified with the official storybook instance following the same steps (or simply see gifs below): phofurl
process should either be left as undefined and expected to be added by projects that need it or at least defined using a shape that matches the expected contract.
please also see this comment phofhyperlink from a maintainer of debug about the contract of `process`
a menu should open next to the shortcuts button showing selectable options -see attached screenshot of expected behavior.
- i expect the scrollbar to not have artifacts - i expect the scrollbar to scroll
props should be passed to specified componen
i expected that storybook would render the component as in the normal setup.
as i don 't need to rewrite the components to manually add the helpers.scss in each one of them.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
to be able to reference objects on the `iframe` window.
it should render the given template and the documentation
the user should be directed to the * notes * github page ` phofurl
the component is rendered correctly with the svg file.
not throw errors of any kind and start the project.
i expect the value within the component to be updated when i type in the `text` knob
should work both on root and nested stories and do not throw `emit` error in the console
if no panels are available to show, the panel shouldn 't even appear at all, allowing the use of the extra available screen space.
that when the story is run, both of the knobs display in the knobs panel: - knob.one - knob two
i expected the same config that worked before ejecting would work after.
i expect that `build-storybook` command will work fine during deployment, it will build my storybook and my deployment will finish with success.
i would expect a button action not to automatically re-render a story.
if re-rendering is desirable in some cases, then a `return false;` could be provided to prevent re-render.
a storybook build should not fail with latest babel, when doing a bugfix version bump.
i expect dependencies in package.json to always be ordered alphabetically.
paths in the output folder should work so that the folder works standalone.
this was the behavior in storybook 3. i have to now resort to this sed trickery to fix the problem: phofcode but would obviously rather have this fixed in storybook
expected to be able to run the storybook server script `npm run storybook`
after knobs have changed nothing happens.
`&#39;` should be render as `'`
when tapping on a button having passed `linkto`, it should navigate to that story and render the component.
height of the panel remains the same, not the top position.
another way to say it, panel top remains same distance from the bottom of window at any given time.
browser should not get hung on using witha11y decorator
the color knob should not require a default value.
(this didn't break prior to this is important because some components may have a color prop that is only used when non-falsy.
the second project should show the default storybook logo.
the baseurl should be respected and the component path `import { roundedbutton } from should be resolved.
no upgrade message at all when you 're on the latest version of the package.
stories should be loaded normally.
if time is let to flow normally, no problems occur.
"no preview" should only show when there is no preview.
viewport size is reduced slightly to avoid the unnecessary scrollbar.
note that this should probably do the right thing even if the viewport is *close to* 100%.
it should show 3 knobs.
sidebarheading should be rendered according to the inputs from options
files goes to configuration groupid
storyshot should work without problems when we use storybook v5 - like it does for v4.
render should accept type htmlelement
i would expect to get the props table populated with all the prop types and their respective description.
here is the code for flowtypebutton.js from official @storybook repo javascript // @flow import react from 'react '; /* eslint-disable */ const message = {}; type propstype = { /
the test should run like for the v3 version of the repo
to see my stories / action loggers on web browser.
work flawlessly the same as `yarn storybook`.
the shortcut keys should always target the correct panel.
it should run the plugins and presets from the custom .babelrc file
no console errors or warnings, and for the action panel to match the docs.
storybook would install properly and i would be a happy boy.
expect the site to build just fine.
which it does if you do any of the following: - remove the `async/await` code, it builds just fine.
tree should stay in order
markdown file is included and content is correctly rendered in the notes tab.
`show toolbox` should show a toolbox on top of the chart, that property comes from a mixin, it seems to me that the mixin prevents the property from receiving the values correctly, see attached screenshot
the event object logged to the action addon should only have a top level set of attributes.
it also shouldn't take that long to stringify, it shouldn't even be noticeable.
the build shouldn 't fail.
storybook should respect `node_path` when checking for `babel-loader`.
for now as the documentation and code reference that the old url structure is still being supported, so the expected behavior is that the story view will also load selected story according to old structure url.
the viewport setting resizes the viewport as shown in the print in the readme.
i would expect `@storybook/react` to firing things up.
i tried removing `@storybook/vue` and then when i ran `npm run storybook:react`, it fires up with `@storybook/html`!
my hunch is, `start-storybook` 's behavior has changed.
if i run `npx start-storybook` or `npx start-storybook -c .storybook/react`, it runs `@storybook/vue` still, despite me pointing to a react config file.
would expect `start-storybook` to simply find the config and infer the storybook type from the imports.
maybe multi-framework support wasn 't in mind in this fashion (i know it is on the road map except as a single storybook), but they share style and image assets.
it worked out fine in sb4.
just point straight desired bin: phofcode
build-storybook works the same as start-storybook
for the test case to only show errors related to storyshots finding changes in the rendered markup, to _mute_ or remove all errors related to `jsdom` and `canvas`.
for this error to not happen and for the action to log with circular data.
i would expect to be able to import global (scss) files in one place so that can be applied to every story 's iframe.
could there be a config setting i 'm not aware of?
i expect that the component should preview should be updated using knobs, even when the component 's change detection strategy is set to onpush.
storybook to work with no runtime errors
i expect a value returned from `date` knob to be as documented: a string.
the ui should fix itself after resizing back to a normal size
instead, we get an error because that component doesn't exist.
i would expect to be able to drop components into storybook without having to use the same css-in-js library/version as storybook.
the selected item should have text according to the theme value that is used in the sidebar item component when selected (`theme.color.lightest`)
it should be able to see the path
either selecting a story from the navigator should auto navigate to the "preview" (or have an option to toggle this behavior) or the keyboard should not force dismiss if appearing when in the navigator view.
* i should see the first story in my first storybook show up, and no errors in the terminal.
should look the same as on dev mode
expect to see the component code
to start storybook without any issues
the css added by the backgrounds addons should have preference over imported css file.
have no change its type or any sort of unexpected transformation on string.
note, this is nothing to do with `escapehtml` knob configs.
errors shouldn 't appear during yarn dev run, and if resolved, i should be able to link an addon to another project and see the components being rendered as usual.
should work in static builds.
popover selection control should appear in front of subsequent controls
`build-stories.js` not imported by storybook.
the function provided by the select option is not removed
static build should work the same a in the dev mode
i would expect this change to have been documented and a workaround provided.
no errors, like in the dev mode.

template should be returned all the time irrespective of story typ
the viewports tab is expected to show up in storybook

i expect to see my brand logo and the panel on the right.
instead i see storybook logo and panel on the bottom.
a warning not to appear
last selected tab should remain selected and active.
if i had a11y selected, it should remain selected but updated with info about newly selected story.
i expect sb to load and show the image.
the correct rendering result should show on first try
storybooks to load up (according to dash it is built correctly);
storybook should let me use jsx without any custom webpack config.
i might be wrong, but storybook should also let me import a css file in my addon and process it out of the box.
the addon panel should be hidden.
you should be able to browse directly to stories by url without needing to use the left navigation.
this also breaks visual diff integrations such as applitools eyes-storybook.
panel should appear on production
the field should act as a normal input, and changes should be reflected in the component.
expect the a11y addon to recognize changes in background color (ex.
when multiple knobs are supplied in the url, all of them should be applied.
not only the last one.
expected links to point towards a working page address: phofurl phofurl
revert to the old display where there wasnt a vertical scroll bar
storybook prioritizes configuration files in `.storybook`
`knob` panel should remain as the primary focus until the user selects an alternative addon
welcome component has linkto function call `linkto( 'button ')` from links addon.
in addon doc i found this: "second (optional) parameter is the story name (what you named with .add).
if the second parameter is omitted, the link will point to the first story in given kind."
i expected to see a working storybook with stories from all of my packages in it.
- to see only those stories whose title match the string input.
- to see the matching text highlighted.
`create` is a simple function it shouldn't need to require emotion?
the actions panel should be cleared out when i navigate to another story.
i would expect to be able to theme the text of the knobs separately to the rest of the theme.
it begins filtering the stories list
stop including styles set in default app in angular.json
the supposed code snippet should show correctly as before
i should be able to search components by name when using a static build.
i was expecting error messages in the console or a working storybook.
no error in the console.
no error in the console
searching for components should work in development and in production
the component is rendered correctly with the svg file.
ie11 should automatically update via hmr like chrome does.
`module` is correct `modules` is incorrect
logo should reflect svg component from `brand` property.
when i browse to the story, the panel on the bottom should not be visible.
should see applied global styling
bundling is successful with defining extra dependencies in project consuming storybook
i would expect scrollbars not to change size when zooming on a component, as they are not part of the component.
run as normal with knobs integrated
the addon panel should either be set to an acceptable width or fit to the component width with additional padding
code compiles and i can get the things i imported from the bundle
should see violations as component is not meeting the a11y configurations `[ 'wcag2a ', 'wcag2aa ', 'wcag21aa ']`

github markdown phofimage or a way to disable copyable code block.
first story works ok, second story fails on initial render
expected the absolute-positioned element to be positioned relatively to the window
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
"story source" should retain its usual width, filling the "middle" panel.
it definitely should _not_, imo, be put inside any dom created for rendering the story.
instead of showing the update message every time it's run it should show you there's an update once a week at max, anything more than that and it get's very annoying very quickly.
this is the behavior i would expect regardless of `--quiet` being passed in or not
- options that aren't supported are removed - sb options should be documented in the main docs not addons/options phofhyperlink docs.
i believe @tmeasday worked on `addparameters`, what do you think?
i expect `moment.js` to be bundled correctly and not throw errors.
see in dashboard a single story named hello world.
display correct source and not log an error.
the navigator view should display the story names.
rather than seeing the no stories message we should show a loading state instead.
the no stories message should only show if there truly are no stories found.
i created up a sidebar:loading phofhyperlink state.
i could use help implementing it.
screen recording at 06 58 pm phofimage
i should get a reference to the `<iframe
'disable from' to appear in the dropdown list
start up storybook without breaking
the scroll position should reset to top every time you change a story
there shouldn't be separators here: image phofimage or here image phofimage
the background and viewports icons should have an active state that looks like this phofhyperlink so that users can discern when they 're activated.
the violations tab should be highlighted
i expect to be able to collapse parent elements arbitrarily even if something nested inside them is selected.
tooltips should disappear when clicking into the preview iframe
i expect the highlighted code to change.
the tooltips should appear "open", i.e., shown, because of the `startopen` prop which is passed through `withtooltip`.
a. we should get an error complaining about lacking loader b. we should get an error, that webpack can not resolve the module

when starting up the app, you expect to see a working storybook instance in your browser, as well as the following in your terminal: image phofimage however if there is an eslint error present, storybook started prompt never occurs and the page is inaccessible: image phofimage image phofimage
when clicking the "about" link it would take you to the target (i.e.
scroll down to the appropriate spot).
result: it reloads the page in to top frame.
the url will persist so you can refresh the page to see changes whilst developing.
just appear a console.warn normally;
i should see my component in storybook with styling applied.
i expect to see the knobs for each story in the knobs panel.
i expect the content in the component to update in real time.

would not experience a template parse error for the second story
don 't show that the app is started when running the smoke test as it 's confusing.
import the component normally, like running with webpack on `npm start`.

in this case, using an already running instance of chromium.
snapshots should render same size.
it should bundle the stories and display them in the browser, according to the guide.
these are the only steps it provides for adding storybook to an existing react project.

the exact same day inputed should be stored in database
content type names should either prohibit safe words like number or object -- or they should not overwrite the default javascript global classes.

otherwise, users will enter data and all of a sudden lose every change because the `save` button is not enabled.
i expected to get email sent by sendgrid from my setting after stripe charge.
obviously, the application should not fail.
strapi should copy into `.cache` folder, then webpack will compile this file automatically, then browser will refresh automatically.
i would expect the log `test policy` to show up in the console and the data to be returned by the `/models` endpoint, just like rest api implementation

here 's your jwt, kid.
to get this fixed i attempted a fresh strapi build using `strapi new cool-project-name` and then migrating my existing api into the new {root}/api folder, and my existing into the new extensions folder.
same error happens in original project (migrated) and in newly shiny strapi project.
thanks in advance for your help on this team strapi.
model venue is titled by field `name`
the app shouldn 't crash
return the name from the `routes.json` variable.
the dropdown list should show the selected value in the group.
as before - allow to create entries using lifecycle methods as with beta.14.
index `name_1` dropped, then new index `title_1` with new property/field.
if jwt `sub` and user id in database doesn 't match type, simply give `forbidden` error.
nothing happens, because it is not a click (i.e.
a click means mouse is clicked outside of modal)
the selected value in the repeatable group relation field should be visible
value should default to null since no value was entered and no default value was specified when setting up this field in content type builder.
an array of entries that match
we should able to restrict, field level permission
the string should be saved in the db without any leading or trailing spaces
the project should be created and run in development mode without errors
previously the builder used to open on beta.15
a searched entry that contains % has found
either documentation is outdated or command is missing.
1. install latest strapi with 'npm install strapi@beta -g' 2. run command 'strapi new <my project> --quickstart' 3. successful return with no deprecations and errors; proper server connection and synchronization with strapi studio
i expected the application to build.
i except the application to start and it should show the model in the sidebar and i don't except that i need to provide any controller actions.
this will work if it's not inside a plugin and i don't have to provide controller actions.
phofcode it will automatically show up in the sidebar: image phofimage
able to update the field.
strapi should be reading the connection variable in the model.settings.json and appending it properly instead of using the default
user should get token and gets logged in with user info
i can choose sqlite and enter the path.
if the path field is empty, it should have some default failover.
that button needs to be removed would be my guess
the error should not be reproduced and the panel built.
the form should accept the value.
send error message that a password is required!
i expected to have the ability to manage `restaurant` permissions.
expected to get jwt(bearer) token
link record can be saved
ability to scroll without the requirement of touchpad or mouse scroll wheels
the mongodb collection should be generated/created upon deployment.
deployment is ok and admin opens.
it should work properly but i am getting error like mentioned above.
entry always updating via api correctly
it should return the first document that it finds (in this case the unique document).
it should return an array of one object following the previous example, but returns an empty array due to the query being replaced to an empty string due to the regex in
after adding a new user, the given password should persist after a save.
no matter the the query string is empty or not i should be able to set the a key value pair in ctx.query
after deleting a content-type, the related records should be deleted.
it should have deleted object.
it should not create `user` and throw error that `category with specific id is not exists` or `invalid category id`.
it should log `in policy`.
i don 't get a 500 error, and see that the content was created successfully.
previously in alpha i was able to filter
i can update the strapi-plugin-graphql to the last version - 3.0.0-beta.15
the data shoudn 't be escaped once saved in the database using strapi.request js sdk.
if i create the super admin user on strapi and then build/redeploy again, i should be able to login with this user (b/c strapi should have used postgresql).
0 to appear in the field and content added with a minimum value of less than 0 being invalid.
yarn develop ...launch admin interface
it should output an array with just the item which url contains `my-page-slug`
it to be possible to override favicon and titles globally
users that were created after the specified date in the query.
strapi starts and asks me to create a new admin user
display that there is no date
i would expect that the relationship be preserved in the lifecycle callback.
admin should build an run, and if needed docs should be updated if there is changes
i expected strapi to return the attributes of the entry that i just deleted, but instead it only returns `null` values.
entry is being edited without stuck.
admin users and api permissions should not reset after any period of time
link must be translated to selected language.
npm install strapi-provider-upload-* should install latest version as per strapi's github repo
created entry has json data inside fields which created with json type
use a port that's not use.
maybe in a first step we could just change the default port.
i am expecting `strapi -v` shows version 3.
strapi should prevent tables with this name while allowing content types with this name screenshot 23 50 39 phofimage
date field would be filled using `beforecreate` hook.
the item in step 4 should be rejected as it is not unique
only return entries matching the query.
i 'm not sure if it problem with "server" name or if we have user and role with the same name
i expected to be able to log in to the admin panel as the user i created
we may, at the most basic point, provide an extra logic inside react input to invalidate "id" string submission.
that 's just a quick fix.
we may add an extra block of logic at model generator/updator layer .
i 'm new to strapi, no dev env set, i 've just completed the quick start guide for now.
if someone can provide insights about location and a bit of core logic i would handle one of the solutions with a bit of time.
i can name my models with camel case (or underscores or dashes to make multi-word models clearly understandable) and be able to use relations and clear ui.
for the filtering to return only the wanted data.
user should be updated with no issue
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
a screen to create admin account
ignore creating new model folder if existing already
for the date variables passed to the query component to work.
to be able to create content for the new added types
the value should be saved correctly
it must be connect with my database properly, because my other application also working with my mongodb database without any problem.
i expected a layout file or some option in admin in which i can choose content types which i want to show in admin.
the reset password email should include a link using the customized admin path rather than the default path.
expect to see the modified subject in a received email and not the one defined in the template.
or even better - allow developer to set default value for date field using model manager: - empty (default) - now - start of today (only date with 00:00 time)
it should probably connect to ip address when running `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
i expected that after the configuration, the callback should use the ngrok tunnel as the host to redirect after successful authentication with facebook.
in admin panel, i see my account is confirmed, so i should login successfully
if i set `amountlimit` to 10, and if i dont set limit, it should only return me 10 records,
as of writing, beta.13 should be recognized as latest version and packages with that version not show up in output of `npm outdated` after release of beta.14 the outdated packages should be recognized and show up with beta.14 as latest available version
i shold be able to new entry and be able to save it.
update is called only for parent entry.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
it should started normally without giving any of such error
only one render when page is loading
the adminui or the backend needs to convert the user visible `true/false` to the proper bookshelf/knex form on mysql which is `1/0` respectively as the field used in mysql for boolean values in `tinyint`
i expect strapi to start normally and have graphql available
get the documents with the filter applyed.
in admin dashboard, the plugin update value via form submit request, which content-type is ``multipart/form-data``, as ``koa-body`` middleware parse request body, we got data like this: image phofimage so in the plugin, code run at here phofhyperlink , and try to parse request body as json string recursive.
phofcode if i post a string field with number literal, it will not detect the field type, and force convert string into number.
for it to bring me to the actual page.
rather than the `photo.url` being a hardcoded value, the databases stores the `public_id`.
the "issue" with this approach is that photo.url is now a hardcoded value, which means that there 's no easy way of applying to the image itself.
cloudinary allows you to, for example, generate a image, by appending url (adding at moment, only thing that i could do is to read this data from database, split( '/ ') cloudinary url add transformations options to it, and then do a join( '/ ').
i 'd love to see feature where database stores `public_id` of cloudinary image which is code snippet below and then use cloudinary sdk generate transformation urls, such as: { width: 250, height: 250, effect: 'cartoonify ' });
graphql to be almost as fast as rest
when i create a customer, with the param 'user ', the field `user` is set correctly every times.
unfortunately, the documentation is not very clear about this, but i expected to go to a page which helps me to log in using my google account
successful upload associated with the "files" field of the "project" entity.
bootstrap a new strapi project
the results given should be the same
would be nice if strapi can handle `stream.type == null` in phofurl
underscores shouldn't cause an issue with content filtering, or at least describe this behavior in documentation
content manager opens as normal
strapi need to open up a way for developers to construct queries that can find data based on a single user , or a group of users.
currently the api server locked user, and cannot be selected to allow "find" or "findone" even in authenticated mode.
if set to authenticated mode.
then graphql editor need allow developer fake a "login" session.
i can logged with the facebook provider i can registered with the facebook provider
permissions restaured like on the strapi backup.
the admin password to be encrypted when being saved after editing, and being able to log in with the newly set password.
i would like to upload image with graphql mutation.
what 's the upload type asked by api?
it should show data of users.
it should finish loading and i 'd have access to the page.
overriding the users and roles should not cause strapi to crash, i'm guessing that there was some hard coded paths somewhere or something isn't properly using the extensions override
unless an explicit policy is given, no jwt validation should occur from strapi 's core.
files greater than 2mb should upload successfully.
you should now have received the internal error.
if i upload multiple files on an entity, i want to keep all relations in _upload_file_morph_ table
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
if connection names should not contain spaces, please add this information + validation on a form.
point 6 should behave as point 5, triggering the `afterfetchall` lifecycle method.
1. make the prefix input optional instead of required.
2. checking "select all" should always select all.
option, provided all are not selected, should say "delete selected"
strapi and plugins should work with all names `generate:api` generates.
`generate:api` should either respect "_" or fail if names include underline.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the documentation plugin should pull from the extensions folder as this plugin
strapi should run using the settings in `config/environment/qa`
reload of admin panel with the users-permissions plugin
should redirect to the defined proxy url.
it create a new field
changes made in the settings.json file are visible at the /documentation/v1.0.0 endpoint
when changing a `text` field to a `string` field, i expect that just a simple one line input field is available to edit the field.
instead, the old wysiwyg editor remains.
when i first time create a fresh strapi project it should start properly after create project.
i expect the route to at least be hit, but code never reaches the controller method
builds successfully (same as using strapi@alpha)
the custom query/mutations that i 've provided should work.
strapi should start, even with relations defined.
should the be able to access my strapi installation at localhost:1337.
ui to assign user permissions should open up
the strapi command will be executed.
graphql should not create colliding schemas between these two models.
administrator model should be completely out of sight of applications.
should pass this step and create a website ok
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the roles and permissions are exactly as documented, and allstrapiarticle should work?
postgres database connections should always appear as postgres, never as mongo.
check one ore more entries and show the bulk edit options.
same result, but taking less time.
for example, we are packing another nodejs app and it takes 1 minute.
admin page should be available
expect all images to upload
no error is generated unless all id properties are duplicate.
no error after starting lb.
i debugged and saw the property being copied from child to parent in but the parent was not updated
i expect an access token inside the ctx parameter
both `<text>` elements should contain `foo bar`, not `foobar`.
the compiled module should have two exports: the default component export and the module context export: phofcode
the value of parent component should also be changed by the child component
keyed list should respect the keys and matching elements should be reordered by getting detached and attached to preserve element instance.
expect a tight-loop of to run to completion.
i would expect either the each block to use the parents value or for the svelte compiler to warn about let directive variable already being defined
i'm relatively new to svelte and rollup, so it's possible there's a config error in my rollup file.
to loop thru thru the set object (perhaps by calling `foreach` phofhyperlink ) the same way it would thru an array.
svelte will not collapse object literal declarations into the short form for keywords.
i 'd like to be able to keep a reference to the item and render an appropriate label.
i guess given how funky this control works in the browser i 'm not sure what the ideal way to handle it is
it should be possible to create any attribute with any value that does not contradict the standard.
conduitry suggested in the discord that this should be replaced with indexof to avoid having to use a polyfill
the css rules should be in the produced css fil
checking the bottom checkboxes (that reside in a different component) should trigger re-renders of other elements like it does when checking the top checkboxes
nothing is render in the slot.
this matches the behavior of passing nothing like
i am able to access 'foo-bar ' and get the value of 'baz '
phofurl i 've had this issue with other css and js files for other projects i"m working on... unrelated to the prisim.js module.
not sure what the best way to solve the issue is.
doing `obj[newkey] = newvalue` causes `values` to update, but doing `delete obj[key]` doesn't.
it works if i do a delete via spread rest: phofcode
the second repl should work.
alternatively, if i could somehow bind the `this` for the `on:submit` function would that make this problem go away (e.g.
is the static fn callstack somehow causing this problem)?
what do i need to change, or is there a bug, why my second example doesn't work?
the derived store should update.
it doesn't, because only the local `$y` variable is updating.
i expected to have selected attribute set as true on "wine" option initially, and then on the other ones when you select them.
svelte shouldn't attempt to assign to `input.files`
i would expect the menu to be shown as per svelte `<= 3.13.0-alpha.1`
dependencies in `package.json` in the downloaded zip should look like this: phofcode but actually looks like this: phofcode
foucs indicator shownm on button sett programmatically to have foucs furing page load / app mount
it is expected to see in the sourcemap constructed uses the `map` object as a base which was passed rather than starting from scratch.
the original .scss files with original `@extend` and `@include` sources, but what we only see are what was generated and it is hard to pinpoint the origin of real source.
the expected behavior of these both statements should be the same and both like using lower example with multiple `if`s.
in the example provided, the readonly attribute should be omitted if false.
it should work like repl 2
compiling as expected, as with 3.12.1.
the component should unsubscribe from the old store and subscribe to the new store.
the old elements should get removed
the count text should increment or decrement based on button clicked.
i attach event listeners as a condition.
if true, the event listener should listen, if false it should be removed
in the repl example when clicking the button the first time count should be 2 and after pressing the button a second time count should be 6.
i expect both versions to work.
do not convert html special characters in hrefs
i expect to see `getcontext` in the standalone component return data from the same context as the parent component from the main application.
allow this kind of block comment, or provide concise error message.
forget about svelteelement if htmlelement isn 't extendable.
rendering works the same way for all buttons
presumably the ` || ` part just shouldn't be there, but i haven't checked whether that code would do what is expected.
- proper compilation without errors
i know that those nodes are for a reason but maybe some virtual approach will be better?
each node must be created updated and destroyed which takes a lot of time and memory when something change.
it is expected that the list should be updated in any case as the store changes.
same behavior as non ssr.
when `visible` becomes false, an alert should appear.
i expected the global css of imported but unused components to not be applied.
but if that is the expected behavior, is there a way to export multiple components from a single package 's index.js file without all of their global css styles being applied when only a single component is imported from that package.
`svelteelement` should only be included in the bundle if you are using custom elements, but it is always being included.
i don 't expect this error to occur!
`(1 === 1) === true` output is: phofcode and should be something like: phofcode
1) no error and llinter succeeds 2) file is reformated via prettier
the bundle should compile correctly.
in the repl, 1. should fade out "foo" and fade in "bar" rather than fade out "foo" and fade in "foo".
i expected to be able to use spread props along side explicit props and that everything is reactive.
note i was not able to reproduce unless the prop being spread was inside a #each and deconstructed.
i would expect the value to bind to the componen
but, if assignment take out to before the compare, it worked, as it should: <script> let toggle = false; function _toggleme() { toggle = !toggle; if (toggle) { console.log(toggle); } else { console.log(toggle); } } </script> <button <span class="text {toggle ?
"red" : "blue"}"> text </span>
expected that binding to an alias would be consistent with binding to an unaliased export.
no visible flickering as the times update
i expected `w` and `h` to be correct by the time the `onmount` code ran.
i'm not certain if that's a reasonable expectation.
ideally, both example 1 and 2 should produce the same output
using the repl as example, should render: phofcode instead, renders: phofcode
editing the text input should update the store
svg's on mobile safari show up as intended instead of a black rectangle.
you can view it working here: phofurl
consistent behavior across all modern browsers
the component switch/transition should not throw an error.
able to use erroralertmessage throughout the app as a store for error messages that happen.
compile as is or just disable iife usage as key.
no duplicate nodes in the dom
the array should be updated, invalidated.
i expect either the true or the false sections of the if statement to show, not both at the same time.
i should not need to manually install svelte 's dependencies; compilation should not fail.
i want to toggle the property depending on the condition
i'd expect a default babel setup to work with svelte and ie11, ios 9 safari
just work as it should be.
the compiler throws an exception and refuses to compile this.
the update to `value` should propagate downward to `refactoredbutton`.
the behavior of clicking the inline button and the refactored component should be the same.
i don 't think `$style = get_store_value(style);` should be output twice.
array should not need to be recreated everytime object is updated
the view should be invalidated and subsequently updated when the source object is changed.
when you click the button the text should change from "hi" to "changed" like it does in 3.6.1 phofurl i think this was caused by same refactor as phofurl in that $$props is not seen as dynamic (it is added the dynamic attributes, but skipped when considering the slot redraw)
i would expect the reactive assignments to fire consistently, regardless of their relative placement to the other statements.
in special, spread attributes to be deleted on `undefined` or `null` values.
in general, spread attributes to behave similar to not spread (at runtime).
value of the variable passed to an event handler is reactively updated
expected: in the repl, expected behavior is that the heading colour changes and the text changes its wording to include the selected colour.
(this can be seen in 3.6.1 link) what happens: the text colour changes, but wording doesn 't change.
i expect `getcontext` to _always_ return the context value, regardless of how the component gets rendered.
when the vue web component is set up to accept `lscallback`, it is passed as a property instead of an attribute.
clicking a tab in the example changes the panel content.
the `data-foo` attribute should be not present when the checkbox is unchecked, not the string `'null'`.
it should compile without errors since the input image element has an alt message.
`` can be used and don't need to be fixed afterwards via encoding conversions this looks correct: image phofimage this is what it really looks like when downloaded: image phofimage
it might be nice if a warning was printed about the missing property.
but the easy immediate fix is to always pass an object, i.e.
this way there 's no disparity between `<slot>` and `<slot
svg elements should be rendered as svg.
waggling either slider should cause things to be logged to the console.
i'd expect elements not to duplicate in dom on their own.
in this replication, the tab should always display the current store value.
i expect all children to slide in together, as it did in v3.6.3.
alternatively i'd expect the child with the transition on it to slide in when the others are done or something.
raw result -> should not have displayed in the api response in swagger ui
able to launch with a readonly filesystem.
an error message that reflects the problem more accurately and does not leave a noob to believe that the problem is unfixable (by them).
it should be possible to render `<pre>` a component plugin under operation using the styles that i give to it.
it assumes the colors from `.opblock-body pre`.
it should show the api supplied in a nice swagger-ui view
if global url parameters are defined, they should be displayed as if they were added directly to method
i expect that request duration section appears in try it out feature.
i expect that topbar will be with empty selector.
swagger ui would render the summary and description in a way that made it clear it applied to all operations
swagger ui should behave as it did in previous versions.
authorization header is included in request.
an http request is sent this works on v3.23.6
either: - the credentials are dropped completely when switching api specs or (preferred): - the credentials are stored but only for the api they belong to when switching to another one.
this way when specifying the`urls` parameter in the `swaggeruibundle` with a specific set of specs the user can switch back and forth between the specs but is still authorized correctly for each api.
just like the required `path` parameter, i expected the `formdata` parameter to be checked on the form validation (red background if the parameter is empty).
the example list should contain only "0" and "1" - i.e.
the examples defined in the spec.
required fields (with pre-populated defaults) should execute without error (given the values are valid).
the validator badge should not show up at all
`filter` object should be displaying the object similar to `response` object.
the pdf should be rendered as an typical pdf file in the swagger-ui or you should provide a download link to extract the file.
response details should take all the column width space
when the link is visited to jump from one page directly to the get call for location/getlocation - i expect the page to scroll down, just like the example in phofurl where it goes to /pet/addpet as a direct jump.
the path should derive the correct tags from the reference at startup, and render in the correct tag group(s) initially.
i was hoping that the use of `securityschemes` above would still show that an `authorization` header is required for all requests to which `scheme: bearer` is applied.
unfortunately this is not the case on swaggerhub (which i assume uses swaggerui, but please correct me if not), where i see a padlock button that can be used to configure the auth header but no explicit textual representation.
no error should be reported to the user, the dropdown should support being set to `--`.
upon clicking the `delete item` or `delete all items` or `delete last item` buttons, the `add item` button should be available i.e.
anytime the array is not full, the `add item` button should be displayed.
parameters sends along with a request in query string
i would expect swagger ui to gracefully handle the yaml anchor circular reference just like it does the normal ones.
when an input value transitions from an examples value to a modified one, swagger ui should make note of which example the modified value was derived from, and use that information to always render the underlying example alongside that modified value.
the swagger ui should obey the openapi specification
produced multipart request should have one part per file in array, containing the data from the corresponding file.
the form has file upload fields for `foo` as well as for additional properties.
the payload should be phofcode check that the profile attribute contains it 's content-type as "application/json".
a typical operation should look something like this: phofcode
the required header field that is empty should shake and warn the user to fill out the required field.
should see the > models section on swagger ui and schema name should be `category` and not `schemas.yamlcategory`
uno and duo pets examples should be displayed for the 200 response examples.
essentially, api calls without empty parameters.
component schema preview shows examples in-line.
1. keyboard focus should be clearly visible/indicated for cancel, execute, and clear buttons 2. keyboard-only users should be able to access the content within "models" section 3. keyboard-only users should be able to access the clickable links example value/edit value and models 4. keyboard focus should be logical inside the dialog box -- only iterate inside the dialog box and not move out of it until & unless exited.
screen reader users will not able to understand flow of focus inside and out of dialog box.
5. keyboard focus clearly visible on schemes combo box & authorize button.
6. keyboard on expand/collapse carrot visible.
7. on "try it out" button visible.
8. on "response content type" combo box clearly visible.
the parametermacro function is executed and set's a default value for the parameter.
i guess this needs some thought but i'd expect to see tag-specific (maybe) or path specific base path overrides in the ui.
execute result and all possible results should be clearly separated.
1. narrator (screen reader) should read the value against the value label, which is represented in the form of asterisks, and should inform the user that value is encoded and secured.
2. name should be provided as "schemes".
3. narrator (screen reader) should read reference of column header (i.e.
4. narrator (screen reader) read mandatory field as required field.
5. narrator (screen reader) read error message when we activate "execute" button.
6. the name property of a focusable element must not be null.
7. name be provided for combo box parameter content type.
8. not state of column as "non selected".
10. proper name be provided for group.
11. table content announced accurately and in structured manner for benefits screen reader users irrespective screen reader used.
12. merge both link button discussed above in single element for benefits screen reader users.
13. provide a hidden instruction about dynamically updated contents benefits screen reader users.
14. the button removed from h4 tag in source code benefits users.
15. an alert or feedback announced when user activates discussed button users.
"dialog" announced popup start popup end provided at starting ending dialog; alternatively, trap user focus within dialog.
17. form elements must have labels.
18. name as 'close '.
20. names both tables "parameters" "responses", respectively.
21. the name property focusable element 'curl ' must not null.
22. proper name a group.
23. buttons must have discernable text.
24. the property a focusable element not null.
the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following: - large-scale text and images of text have a contrast ratio at least 3:1 - text or images that are part an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part a picture contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement - text is part a logo or brand name has no minimum contrast requirement
parameters in the path should display the same as path parameters placed in the operation.
i expect the relative urls in the oauth definition to be resolved to the current api server.
that is, if my server is ` phofurl the authorization url should be ` phofurl
fenced code blocks should not require additional indentation
description should appear scopes infos should not appear if i don't want to.
the website renders, topbar and all.
the request should be made with http, not https
expected to see a value between minimum and maximum phofcode p.s.
this probably is valid for other parameters like e.g.
it 's possible that this is also a feature request and not a bug, i am not quite sure.
there is of course an easy workaround to provide own exampl
expected to see only date in example phofcode
errors should remain at the top of the page until and unless manually dismissed.
errors should also ideally be added to the console log.
the operation expands, allowing me to view and try it.
rendered to continue to work and not crash allowing validation to reassert itself.
i expected the generated spring server would contain two controllers, one per tag
the form input "shakes", indicating that its a missing and required field.
you can successfully log out and authorize again with authorization code flow
better wrapping and space distribution.
wrapping would ideally occur at a '/' in the path and more horizontal space should be given to the summary.
operation expansion in less than 1 sec
`swagger-config.yaml` changes the defaults but is overridden by other config mechanisms.
all components should be shown equally.
parameter or path variable is in generated curl before execute captura phofimage after captura2 phofimage
the ui does not hang or only for a very short time when entering words in the request body text field.
examples for the `test` parameter should be shown somewhere in the ui
a 200 with no response body should yield some sort of warning, because the schema should at least be `{}` a 404 from the server should yield a big red error somewhere.
should only open the clicked item
no memory leak, per phofurl
expected the example section to be the same depth as the model section swaggeruiissue1 phofimage swaggeruiissue2 phofimage
the swagger ui should display it as html code, rather than plain text
i would expect to see the date that is provided in openapi definition.
the file works correctly in chrome and edge, but fails in firefox.
i would expect it to behave the same across all major browsers.
the 'type ' parameter is dropped from the form data portion of the curl when there is no recognized type.
should provide a "try out" to get the entities from the service.
request is sent with user-agent equal to specified parameter
since the `url` configuration parameter is supposed to be ignored, the page should load with the first url listed by the `urls` configuration parameter.
there should be red border to indicate error on `test` input.
there should be minimum, maximum validation information in ui.
(like it was for swagger 2.0)
compile an application without any errors
spec selextor textbox updates with changes made by interceptor.
it must display atleast the first two attributes which has a valid type.
i would expect it to use both the settings from the config file found from the config_url and also to load the api docs from api_urls.
resolve refs and no errors.
work as it is described in openapi documentation.
go to phofurl and see the server list appear correctly on version 3.19.0.
required property should be marked by red asterix
the spec should be detected as oas3 on subsequent calls to `swaggerui` or `swaggeruibundle`
servers should be displayed inline, similar to swagger 2.0 schemes: <img width="1058" alt="image" src=" phofurl
(x-www-form-urlencoded) example swagger/openapi definition: phofcode curl1 phofimage
i should see "value: **** * * "
the request is executed and includes use of the required header.
empty requestbody is ignored, description of path is avaliable.
or i can see an error while
no error, the definition is valid.
`swaggeruibundle` should be successfully imported (along with but the problem isn 't with that)
i would expect a message similar to "no example values are available for content type to be shown in the place of an example value for responses using
the visual output is fine in this example, however there are javascript errors emitted (and the online editor shows them).
the displayed curl request should not be undefined.
it should display the same information regardless the number of calls.
it should not store any information about the first time it was invoked.
the request url should be phofcode
the model should contain values such as id and username.
corresponding values should then be shown in the "example value" box also.
ui sends the http request and display the results
i expect that getting the link url from an operation gives me a correct deeplink, e.g.
when changing enum to id 2, sending a request for parameter id 2
inventoryitem and type to become individual definitions
i should see phofcode displayed in example box
i except the window to close and be back authenticated on swagger ui interface (like in chrome).
in example value tab should be combined schema with all resolved references
it should use value that is set
i expect that 'try it out ' panel will contain button to select file for media types 'image/* ' , not only for
using oauth2 with authorization code flow should work while using phofurl
the endpoint ui element should unfold properly.
the normal built-in redirect to the endpoint including the final slash should occur.
linebreaks are converted to spaces.
contiguous lines are combined in a single `<p>`.
i would expect to see the example xml for the response.
the json should just be: phofcode
it shouldn't allow to authorize an empty textbox
file downloads correctly observed: file is corrupted as described in the linked issue
the "global" security requirement should work for all endpoints for the defined endpoint.
the server url used in fetching an oauth2 token is the one shown in the `server` dropdown.
there is no warning shown.
when the header field is empty no header should be sent since it is configured as optional
the response headers should be very similar since the call is made to the same endpoint
i would expect pattern validation to apply tot he default/example fields correct,
the form should not clear.
you can see this behavior in public/good.html
"test-value" would be set in the testheader input field.
the id should be a valid html id, like on the operation section itself: phofcode
data should render properly like it did with swagger 2.0 ui
image phofimage the response content type render correctly, and we can chose the item in the drop-down box successfully.
model should not corrupt inputs shape.
the tf.random_normal() of py2 and py3 with same seed should get the same result.
the returned object should be a legal tensorarray instance, as is the case when you use only eager mode functions.
in this case the object type is
should probably not give any warnings
the memory shouldnt increase on each interation
to return a dataset iterator
no errors, and a correctly saved model :-)
`import tensorflow` succeeds without the exception
a warning is logged and the code continues to execute.
`tf.saved_model.save()` should work naturally for autographed functions even if they output a `raggedtensor`.
model should compile without errors as in pure keras
training the network doesn 't fail
the expected behavior is that an epoch will completely go through the dataset, and it will report a reasonable validation loss, and it will take some time to go through the entire dataset.
i see the correct behavior in tf 1.15, and the epochs take ~45 minutes to complete (as expected), validation metrics are calculated, and progress bar looks something like this (which is nothing special :) ) phofcode
i 'm upgrading from `tf.py_func` in tf 1.14 to `tf.py_function` tf 2.0 and it was possible to map the `tf.py_func` that called the augmentation onto the dataset.
the gradients should exist for these layers.
with the script below my idea is to understand how i can modify, with a customized layer, the value of the tensors of a network being trained.
i would like to model this behavior with static and dynamic assignments.
it seems that i succeeded by assigning constant values see the function * assign_op * , while if i use symbolic values of tensor to modify same values of tensor cannot understand what is wrong.
make several tests but fail, in particular, with atomic assignments.
where for atomic assignments mean single value tensor assignments.
there should not be any delay or at least no perceivable.
is expected to work fine in both cases.
i needed feed different category images to different gpu(all the images have same size, such as input dogs' images to gpu 0 and cats' images to gpu 1) and apply the averaged gradients.
if there is any efficient alternative way of doing this (hopefully yes, as indicated by the warning message in the code "conv2dbackpropfilter uses a while_loop.
all `list` methods should be supported for defining nested list of layers.
it should be true for both
it should finish the save process successfully.
i expect training to proceed without issue.
i would like `fit_generator` to complete even when i use my custom callback.
according to the documentation phofhyperlink : `given a list of tensors or ragged tensors with the same rank r (r >= axis) [...]`.
here, r=1 and axis=0, so the preconditions should be fulfilled.
it pass when saving and loading model from .h5 format.
should only close those writers that will not be needed any longer.
`metrics` should be computed in any case to give insights about the training as it is based on model output and true value given by the data loader/sequence.
model training time should be closely equal in both the cases i mentioned.
the expected behavior is that the above snippet will not return errors (log attached below) potential solution: check the input `x` in `dtype()` method in happy to contribute if this is helpful :)
a result, possibly incorrect (due to too small dtype), or some other way to deal with the issue, e.g.
assertion errors or other exceptions, however no crashing of python.
* ideally * , `tf.reduce_mean` could yield correct results for non-floating-point dtypes as well.
the training should run smoothly.
when using the same gs:// path with
data transferring overlaps with computing in order to speed up training.
from the keras documentation, it should work.
i expect the interpreter to be able to resize all the tensors.
below you can find the simple model i 've built to reproduce this issue.
what i 've notice is that without the `concatenate` op allocation works correctly.
there should not be an error.
i would expect, that model_copy is known to both gradient tapes and can be used w/o using meta_model.
should return an `autocastvariable` variable instead `tf.variable` so that the `dtype` is preserved.
@reedwm is this intended behavior?
the converter should run and save optimized model to 'models/mymodel_tensorrt
it is expected that all the experiments above should succeed.
however, experiment 1 fails, but 2 and 3 succeed.
3 means the collective executor works in a multi-task way of executing the graph on `all_reduce`.
2 means `all_gather` works if only collects tensor within one graph.
1 means the bug where `all_gather` fails to collect tensors across tasks.
well, increasing ccuracy and no error basically
i expected the converted function to be invariant of the optimiser instance.
i expect to get an array of labeled probabilities, but the app crashes instead.
the expected behavior is that the model performs the inference without any need to be compiled and returns the result.
in fact, this behavior is meet when the model is saved with keras format ('model.h5') and loaded.
should execute in a comparable time to a dense tensor.
- allow square brackets in the checkpoint path or - fail at checkpointmanager creation if `directory` parameter contains disallowed characters
i expect it to not crash when running
i would like to have the training metrics logged as well.
* the graph construction above sets the expected shapes of the placeholders as polymorphic `[none]`.
however, after the first `session.run`, the collective op caches its output shape (which is `16` in our case) in but should it be expected that collective op keeps its graph-defined polymorphic behavior?
specifically, in our case, should it allow a user to all gather two size `7` tensors into a size `14`?
in tensorflow graph mode, we know when multiple sessions talk to the same cluster (which is defined by `clusterspec`), everything works pretty smooth and natural.
should eager context behave similarly?
that is, both the above processes are expected to run naturally: print the contant and string and exited.
in other words, when multiple contexts talking to the same cluster (which is defined by `clusterspec`), should they know how to coordinate with each other, just as tensorflow core is architectured and designed before?
(or is there any other api that could help resolve this issue?)
do not remove checkpoints that are not owned by a checkpointmanager instance.
in the code below, i expected to have checkpoints 1, 2, 4, 5 at the end.
instead, only 4 and 5 survived.
result should not depend on eagerly mode on or off.
we should be able to train the model when restored from savedmodel.
no error during the training with the filtered dataset in the `input_fn` of the estimator
while using tuples for multi output model works fine, using a dictionary fails.
dict inputs and outputs seem to be allowed in the code (and in the tf.keras documentation), however the functionality seem not to be functional yet.
there should be no error, as in fit/evaluate methods work fine.
for the inceptionv3 model, the top1 miss rate of tf-trt int8 quantized model shall be smaller than 3~5% after calibration, however, i got top1 miss rate >29%
when calling estimator.train with 'evaluator ' included in runconfig, a valueerror should be reported.
the following is the fragment code in estimator_training.py.
if 'evaluator ' in cluster_spec: raise job is not supported if you don 't use " here the value of cluster_spec is like 'ps ': 'worker ': if 'evaluator ' in cluster_spec.jobs which is the way it should be.
the images marked with the boxes.
small batch size should also give me the correct result since my original un-optimized graph can handle small batch size.
inference should not crash, as it does not in other ios devices
the output should be following: phofcode i got correct output for following versions of the function: phofcode and (when tf.function is removed) phofcode and when i use small value for np.eye phofcode can you reproduce my error ?
unless i misunderstand, the gradient when using peephole connections is incorrect.
the peephole gradient should be taken into account _either_ in the gpu kernel _or_ by the eigen computation, but not both.
the benchmark with the second package should be faster than the first one.
the values for `loss` and `mean_squared_error` should agree and both use the masking.
there should be no error
i expect tensorflow to continue to run successfully when using the --runtime=nvidia arg, i.e.
i would expect the output to be random.
instead, the first and second value are always repeated every fourth element.
the program should load the model.
it should train fluently, and i try on google cloab, it try fluently, but it train error on my computer.
the gradients should be calculated well regardless of how many times we call the layer within a phofcode .
the unit test should run successfully.
code should run without error
i was expecting the custom training loop can be run using different optimizers.
the model loaded from savedmodel should keep the named inputs.
this should not fail in any case, except if i am using the `custom_objects` argument wrong.
the documentation could be a little expanded on that matter by the way.
the moving variance should not be nan
for the minimal example script provided below, here is the output: fwd:: non_stateful: [ 1.
-0.5 0.25] stateful: [ 1.
-0.5 0.25] stateful: [ 0.875 -0.4375 delta: [-0.125 0.0625 bwd:: non_stateful: [1. stateful: 0.875 0.25 -0.5 ] delta: [-0.125 0.25 ]
tpu training should run similarly to gpu training (without errors in this case)
it just works as in the docs
lstm model would be saved in the savedmodel format to be exported into a google cloud bucket to work with google 's ai platform.
after restoring from the checkpoint, i expect the iterator to return the same elements as it did after saving the checkpoint.
to be able to create savedmodel directory
behavior for different initializers should be consistent.
should accept a tuple of `dimension` objects for shape, as other initializers do.
: it should update the tensor given the row, column position
compile the lstmcell code correctly
expected behavior is that multiple tf.keras models can be instantiated on multiple threads without conflict.
should pass and not raise exception.
valueerror: no such layer: embeddings
the app should run just fine with the paths specified.
'model'))` should load the data without problems
i have done this several times before so i am not sure why i am all the sudden getting this error.
i even tried evaluating my old model with these scripts and it still gives me the same error.
a model is compiled and trained using `script a` on the google compute engine.
the weights are saved separately rather than altogether due to #33947 , using the `model.save_weights()`.
the weights are then saved as a zip, and transferred to a windows-based machine.
on the windows-based machine, the same code is run to compile model but instead of training model again - weights are loaded using `model.load_weights()`.
the weights are loaded successfully.
either, tf 2 should behave similarly to tf 1, ie use up the entire validation set.
or report a more informative error regarding 'validation_steps ' requirement (similar to the error if steps_per_epoch are omitted for the training data).
training a conv network without an error
by setting clipvalue=0 or clipnorm=0 no training should occur (gradients should be 0!
), but the network still trains, and if using a large learning rate, loss goes to nan.
the expected behavior is that the program should run correctly in a between-graph replication as if the graph does not contain collective ops everything will run correctly.
math ops perform similarly to when they have dense tensor inputs but returning a sparse format, e.g.
i need a interface from the new api like this: # rnn cell model.add(simplernn( # for batch_input_shape, if using tensorflow as the backend, we have to put none for the batch_size.
# otherwise, model.evaluate() will get error.
batch_input_shape=(none, time_steps, input_size), # or: input_dim=input_size, input_length=time_steps, output_dim=cell_size, unroll=true, ))
the model can be learned on colaboratory 's tpu using custom layers.
model saving should not fail.
loading saved functional model raises exception.
1.why the input shape and output shape is different from the model retrained using object detection api ?
2.the code i modifyied to using gpu delegate is right?
using the c api or the original source code, the configuration of gpu must be the one defined with code.
i presume issue is with c api because training in c++ works on gpu.
it should not fail with this error :-)
i expect kl_divergence(x, x_pred) in my code to return a scalar, and no out of memory errors.
with mask_zero = true, anytime there is an input of 0 in one of the time steps, the output should be same as the previous time step 's output.
i suppose can be used in exactly the same way as
i expect a example which is possible to execute
trace shows complete function names (at least) and signatures (optional) or even better: layers to which those activities/events belong.
with mirroredstrategy the same accuracy is reached as training on one gpu in shorter time (ideally in half the time).
might be related to issue #33767.
k can be used as 1-d tensor
there should be no error.
it works fine with tf2.0.0 and python 3.6 or python 3.7.
no sigus should be raised
it doesn't make sense to me that the possibly buggy inference of a shape influences whether an op is supported or not.
also, i am not sure if the hard-coded model can be trusted or not.
a tflite file is expected to be created and written to the local directory.
i think in the validation step if i set phofcode to phofcode the model should use the learned moving mean and variance as expected but it doesnt seem so.
the gradients should be the same.
right now, it seems like `tf.contrib.slim.conv2d + gives the correct gradient.
the code should just run and update the parameters per usual.
1.13 and 1.14 behavior phofcode phofcode
yesterday, i run this jupyter nootbook successfully.
writing ~90 layers of batchnormalization should take smaller amount of ram.
the expected behavior would be that using `tf.function` results in the same behavior than the eager mode.
the current issue is that autograph doesn 't recognize `tqdm(dataset)` as a `tf.data.dataset` (which is normal).
however, iterating infinitely over the dataset in autograph is weird and shouldn 't happen.
maybe it should give an exception.
maybe the easiest fix would be to prevent `dataset.__iter__` being called inside `tf.function` if it is not in a loop.
so `for x in dataset` would be fine, but `for x tqdm(dataset)` wouldn 't.
to "fit" the model without error
should save a tflite file after conversion
gpu version is expected to be faster ( or at the least same ) than cpu version.
exclude the lstm `c` state from the list of dropout candidates.
either handle the case where is/contains `none`, or explicitly throw `valueerror` if it shouldn 't be allowed.
i think it should gives a good result
according to and cudnn release notes, 3d convolution operations on volta architecture should benefit from amp training with the tested versions of tf, cuda and cudnn.
when debugging with i can see why the ops are not optimized: `i skipping readvariableop node because it must be preserved` i can 't figure out why those items must be preserved.
in the source code, i think they are marked as nodes to preserve in in but i could not find out the exact reason.
it would be nice if the object detection example code worked without having to remove my existing tensorflow install.
dataset initializes and no segfault when creating next batch
i would expect the dataset class to be imported.
load_model loads the custom metric successfully either just implicitly or through the custom_objects dict.
output names to be restored when loading the model and dictionaries for losses to be working when loading the model.
the quantized model gives similar output values with the original tf graph.
with quantization=true, phofcode the output of the tflite model seems too different with that of the original tf function.
when quantization=false, phofcode their outputs looks same.
it does not seem normal that quantization gives too much differences in output values.
similar timeline shown as for e.g.
it should behave like python3: reading the x characters.
`tf.keras.model.fit` should apply `class_weight` when passed a `tf.data.dataset`.
it should raise an exception for incorrect `class_weight` keys.
when i convert the keras model to the tensorflow model, but i get an error above.
the expected behavior is a successful epoch ending.
should be able to import tf.broadcast_weights in tf 2.0
mentioned test scenario should not hang.
code should work for batch size of 1
correct progress bar information progress bar reasonably short
the expected value of a gamma-distributed random variable with shape parameter a and inverse scale parameter b is a/b, so the empirical mean should be close to a/b.
so i would expect the output of my script to be close to 0.
value is fetched without warnings.
i would expect the same weights, not sure which weights are the right ones
we should be able to create a tensor with buffer
same code was working few days ago, also the example codes in seedbank are using same code and they were working fine.
now all are not working.
it should work without throwing error.
when saving a checkpoint using restoring the checkpoint should also recover the optimizer variables.
operations in compat.v1 for rnns for tf2.0 should be supported for eager execution.
dense_net should have shape information: `<tf.tensor 'lambda_6/identity:0' shape=(none, 10, 5) dtype=float32>`
all 3 tests should pass.
should work the same as all other weighted metrics.
the code written by me should get the same result as the tensorflow c++ code.
however, i got much different result.
when i use tf2.0 in another conda environment, it gives me: phofcode
it should be possible to free the function calling `import tensorflow`.
this is not an issue with any other imports (like `import logger`).
i want to make a custom decoder layer with a stateful lstm and a pre-net which is a simple dense, but i do not want to use sequential or functional api, because i want to control with reset_states() when the lstm states will be reset.
it always shows the error above.
how should i give the input shape in this custom layer?
repeated tf.train calls train for the given amount of steps.
i would not expect upgrading the library to slow down data infeed.
no long term upward trend in training time.
`tf.print` should print out values as was specified in phofurl
when run freeze.py, it should success according to the tutorials.
in the doc, read() shoud return the contents of the file as string
i expect the value of the global random seed to be taken into account every time a pseudo-random number is generated.
one node for all batch sizes.
the application should not crash when calling (almost) any function in the tensorflow api.
i am no expert on dynamic libraries on windows, but i have read that the `.dll` and the `.exe` have separate heaps.
one might speculate that the error could have something to do with this (but in that case i do not understand how).
has anyone actually managed to use `tensorflow_cc.dll` (on windows) at all?
i don 't have same issue on linux.
a possible workaround might be to build a static `tensorflow_cc.lib`.
for my purposes, it does not matter much if use a dynamically or a statically linked library.
run the command "python -c "import tensorflow as tf" within conda cli without error.
successfully saving a savedmodel with the layer.
`model.evaluate` should not raise this error after training.
the dataset stops after returning all the records in the sqlite database.
i would expect to see the number of samples/batches/etc.
being able to import from tensorflow_core (eg: from import model) with no problem.
there should be no error.
the code works only when phofcode
my expected behavior is that tensorflow 2.0 version with savedmodel would use gpu acceleration.
maybe i am missing on how to import the savedmodel in python.
please let me know what could be the route cause of it.
that code should print identical arrays (the latter is correct, the former is not).
ideally, would not like to see the error.
as currently seeing the error, more information along the following line will help a lot determining the root cause.
1. see more detailed log on what offending layers and tensors are.
2. what exactly is value that is issue, in this case batchsize ?
3. where in code this is occurring - do not see any file called builder* in tf 1.14 source.
if error in happening elsewhere third-party code ( this case , may be nvidia tensorrt closed source ) - making that explicit.
4. in this case, where is it getting 0 for batch size.
the efficiency of the code should be same.
the exact same code was running fine with tf1.14 with no memory problem
if i used instead it would work, i expect using momentum optimizer to work as well.
checkpoints should be restored properly
error should not be raised, code should work.
training should proceed without problems, the data is valid.
when trained during eager execution, using phofcode the model is trained without problems, and i expect using `model.fit_generator()` would allow this behavior too.
upsampling2d outputs size times the size of the new input
the training commences and finishes normally.
i expect the function to be called concurrently by pair: phofcode
as dy/dx = a2 + b, i expect result of 32.0 for dy_dx
in tensorflow 1.14.0 and 1.13.2, it works correctly.
the model only updates for model1 without any checking for model2.
in tensorflow 2.0.0 supposed the model.save model default to be saved in savedmodel format.
throw a warning when silently rounding.
maybe convert to float instead of integer if input is a float dtype?
consistent behavior at creation-time of model and after re-loading from a save file.
a `valueerror` should be produced in response to the incorrect input shape, whether or not eager execution is enabled.
train model distributed without error.
jupyter notebook should authenticate its own token.
calling load and freeze in different python functions should work unless there is some hidden assumption in tf 2.0. my guess is that there is a leak or some dependency between the two apis.
enabling eager mode or control flow v2 should not affect the training time (or improve it, ideally).
i want to make the if statement in my code work.
the if statement is as follows: # compute jaccard for each default box for gt_list in actual_list: gt_label = gt_list[1] gt_box = gt_list[0] for i in range(len(matches)): # i].shape --> (4, ) jacc = jaccard(gt_box[0], i]) jacc_thred = tf.where(0.5 <= jacc, 1, 0) if(jacc_thred == 1): matches[i] 4 # <--
if a model works during model.fit(), i expect the same model to also work for `saved_model.save()`.
the script should print `x == y?
according to the docs phofhyperlink on > if the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set: a default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to determine random sequence.
this does work correctly when not executing eagerly
the evaluate method must provide results close to the fit method, especially after 100 epochs
using theano i get 28 seconds by iteration.
using tensorflow 2.0.0 i expect same behavior (or better).
if runing model.fit() with progbar callback and verbosity=0 should be identical to verbosity=1 and no progbar callback
i would expect a minor release (10.0 to 10.1) which has been out for almost 2 years to work correctly.
furthermore the error doesn 't specify anything regarding cuda 10.1 not being supported.
if this would be the case then that 's the error i would expect.
a new version should have similar or better performance than the previous version.
if user error or a new limitation/feature is causing the problem, it should be warned about in update notes/quick start.
this code was perfectly normal in tf 1.x
the results should be the same as in tf1.x
with tensorflow 1.14.0, the tutorial works just fine, but with 2.0.0 it runs out of memory.
this is a small machine that amazon has on it's free tier (t2.micro).
it comes with 1 gb of ram, and i'm not expecting it to run anything really large, but it's an ideal machine from a cost perspective to try out tensorflow basics, and it works just fine with tensorflow 1.14 and earlier.
i ran the same code with keras (not tf.keras) using a tensorflow 1 backend a while ago and it gave correct results.
the loss after 1 or 2 epochs is supposed to be around 0.3 the validation loss is supposed to be a little less than 0.3. the graph below this code was produced using keras and a tensorflow 1 backend.
it shows the correct output.
francis chollet 's original notebook (as linked to github above) also shows the correct output.
zipfiles written with `file=gfile()` should be not be corrupt and equal to those written with `file=<other_type_fd>`.
`mkdir()` should throw an exception if the path exists, like the python built in `os.mkdir()` phofhyperlink does.
tensorflow should always detect all attached gpus, even on subsequent runs.
depthwiseconv2d needs the dilation_rate argument.
it is supported by underlying code and mentioned by the depthwiseconv2d documentation, but is missing from depthwiseconv2d.
expect to be able to train with any optimizer from keras' options.
i expect the memory to not continuously increase
that code should produce an array `[0j, 1j, 2j, ...]` no matter how many times it's run.
should work with tfx pipeline such as tensorflow_transform and
keras should work as described in the api without calling numpy behind the scenes in graph mode and crashing
use gpu to accelerate inference
i think the inference time of quantized models should be much lower than that of float point models.
use the metadata in tensorboard
the model should improve in accuracy.
importing tensorflow should not print errors about hadoop.
i dont have hadoop installed and am not interested in using it.
expected tensorflow match nvidia-smi device indexes
consistency of implementation between cpu/gpu, correct values.
instead, should check the first non-`identity` node when determining whether the last node is a softmax node.
it should first walk the chain of identity nodes.
model.evaluate should work and provide a result close from the last fit iteration
validation steps should also be run on gpu.
`reshape` conversion recomputes the reshape size whenever `resizeinputtensor` is called.
optimizer runs metric to convergence
the prescribed `steps_per_epoch` remains the same in the progress bar for all epochs.
same runtime for models with same architecture, no matter whether it is keras(h5) converted to tflite, or pb converted to tflite.
`cat label.pbtxt` > some txt in the file 'label.pbtxt ', overwrite=true)` `cat label.pbtxt` > some txt in the file
the send/recv tensors `tensors` gives proper answer on all workers.
return the value like eager mode.
tensorflow 2.x should work with a custom nested layer as tensorflow 1.x can.
expected behavior is that the two methods to use a model are consistent.
the model.call() processes the inputs using the standardize_input_data() method to ensure the input data is as expected.
the `input_shape` should be set to the shape passed to `compute_output_shape`.
fix the rng bug in parallel mode maybe?
i would like to use keras layers within the custom layer, and have them trainable.
training parameter should be true in training and false in inference
i mean, it should just work, shouldn 't it?
why is this so hard?
the vocabulary file should be saved in the assets directory of the savedmodel.
the model should work without mandating `@tf.function` decorator.
see the code for details.
custom kernel performance should be no worse than implementations in terms of other operations.
the test_negative test should pass, as the call to bincount with a negative input value is expected to throw an invalidargumenterror.
`tf.nn.relu` should handle `nan` inputs from all sources consistently.
to keep consistency with other activation functions, it should return `nan` in all cases.
the expected behavior is that i am able to load multiple inception v3 graphs and afterwards unload all of them without any memory leak.
i want to use the tflite file in android, however, i even can 't use it in python
applying batch normalization on top of batchwise tf.map_fn should pass without issue, as in this case it should emulate batchwise matmul.
if the entry size larger than 2gb, we should read it from parts not in a whole
once the graph is built and the batch size is constant, the memory usage of the model should stay same so that there is no out of memory error upcoming during training process.
keras should match up targets with the correct output when casting, according to the loss dictionary defined in `compile`.
if a model output is not part of the loss function, then it should be ignored when casting targets.
the expected behavior is that it would finish training.
can you provide any recommendations as to how to stop it from seg faulting during training (and why it stops at a different point each time)?
i 'm wondering if the warnings could have to do with it?
i also have seen other people online having issues with tf.session, so i 'm wondering if that could be it?
it should be able to convert the model to tflite format.
that the function is not going to be autographed.
i would expect to not have a runtime failure at inference time on the jvm: either `operationbyname` would recognize the `request:0` node or another java api would exist to fulfill my requirements.
the same code worked in tensorflow 1.13. in tensorflow 1.13, `k.__module__` does not exist, while in tensorflow 1.14, `k.__module__` is ~~~ ~~~ it makes the `tensorflow.keras` module not loaded during unpickling.
there are multiple applications use pickle to ship tensorflow code to a remote machine to unpickle and execute, e.g., spark, horovod.spark.
so the behavior change would fail the jobs.
btw, one workaround is to do `from tensorflow import keras as k` instead of `import tensorflow.keras as k`.
the diff is that `k.__name__` is in the first case and `tensorflow.keras` in second.
and pickle uses `__name__` get global names: phofurl cc: @alsrgv @hanyucui @annarev
model.save() should save the model.
the expected behavior would be that all positive labels in each example be assigned value 1 instead of `1/num_true`.
this way, the sigmoid which applies independently to each label will try to produce a `y_hat` for each (positive) label close to 1 instead of `1/num_true`.
the solution would be: ` out_labels = 1) `
the use of `@tf.function` should correctly create autograph
not to crash when fit.
it seems like being able to assign integers to tensors while using distributed training is something that should be possible, given the goal of abstracting away distribution as much as possible.
i know the distribution strategies may be kind of in flux right now, and i'm mainly just posting to make more knowledgeable people away of the issue; i'm just going to make all my tensors floats in the meantime :).
i don't have context know how this should be approached anyway.
make it so that tensors don't always have be divided?
divide integer tensors by assigning everything one worker and giving zeros everyone else?
custom loss function should be loadable.
it should only evaluate all outputs defined in keras model, not only pick one.
it should only summary one scalar.
should save records even out side of by default.
it's very unnatural that we need to call or to save records in eager execution mode.
the `training` flag should be passed to and to each stacked cell.
no assertion error, or at least a better explanation as to the cause.
i want to see gpu0 and gpu 1 when run the device list command
interpret primitive type as tensor at the right time.
the model should be able to resume training after loading weights trained on multiple gpus.
in my c program i can load/save/restore my model with no problem, i am expecting to be able to load trained model and make predictions in python as well from the model trained in my c program.
that the python kernel operate normally.
please help me get an accurate measurement of how much memory my current model and batch size is really taking to run on a gpu with tf.
the only trustworthy metric i see in this labyrinth is nvidia-smi, but only for the batch sizes at which it suddenly steps up.
should work with the default `__call__` method of any subclass of `tf.keras.layers.layer` under both tensorflow 1.14 and 1.15-rc0.
i expect tf.keras.layers.add can process tensors of any dimension.
upon using tf.keras batch normalization at test time, a given input sample x should have the same output regardless of the other samples in the batch
the rnn layer should check the type of the rnncell and, if it is a subclass of `dropoutrnncellmixin`, reset the dropout masks after each call.
the program can load model file successfully.
expect the training to slowly progress given the memory is not big enough to hold the tensors then the swap should be able to help.
the conv nn should have worked just fine
the local variable `packed` should have a value set.
directory for saved model is created and saved model is saved correctly
there should be no error, multi-input rnns with stateful=true should work the same as with stateful=false (other than preserving state).
the memory should not grow indefinitely
`converter.convert()` call finishes without errors
either don 't produce a sigsegv but a more meaningful error message or simply don 't fail at all.
the same output as the original model
to compute the jacobian without complaining.
in the example code below, `model.summary()` outputs `[(none, (2,))]` for the output shape.
according to the docs/examples, i would expect that to be `[(none, 2)]`.
when attempting to place layers after this, it returns two placeholders, despite the output shape only defining one.
calling tf.function from tf.py_function does not hang the program.
run smoothly, `c_api.tf_sessionrun` expected to be thread-safe when used with a separate session and graph for every thread.
`sparse_reshape` should work similarly on both windows and unix-based systems.
model.fit should not throw any error.
note this was working fine in `2.0.0-beta1`
v1 models should load correctly, or present the user with a way to migrate the model to a more compatible format.
tf only use 1 thread and 1 cpu core
i 'd expect the error to be the same in case of as in case of division as it turns out to be the dtype issue.
the model containing sequencefeatures layer and any corresponding feature_columns is loaded by without errors.
such a model should be usable.
phofcode implicitly accepts any dtype (as long as input dtypes match).
to be able to save a model on ai platform.
working keras model should always be convertable to estimator.
i know i could turn off verbosity, but i would expect sane defaults for the progress bars printed by tf/keras.
and with `verbose=1` that thing is so huge, it 's useless.
fix is simple, replace the lines: phofurl with: phofcode
the stateful rnn should use the initial state the first time, and then update the state and use it for each following time.
either throw some light on the usage in the documentation or in the example.
load local cifarl dataset to numpy array without reporting any errors
expected to see some improvement.
graph execution does not effect graph construction, the model should be the same.
each time evaluate is called with the same data, it should take roughly the same time.
also, when running fit with validation, each epoch (after the first one at least) should also take roughly the same time (this does happen without validation data, but doesn 't happen with validation)
i expect to be able to delete the iterator object within the tpu strategy scope.
loading a save h5 file and saving the resulting tensorflow pb results in a well formed pb that can be used for inference.
i expect the model to be able to run and calculate loss on tpu using xla
i don 't understand this error, because i do provide the `validation_data` argument to the `fit_generator()` function.
also, i used exactly the same code with keras on top of tf1, which worked fine there.
this warning came now after switching to tf2 and built-in keras api
as per the docs, `tf.boolean_mask` phofhyperlink should accept a scalar `tf.tensor` phofhyperlink object as axis parameter.
> * `axis`: a 0-d int tensor representing the axis in `tensor` to mask from.
by default, axis is 0 which will mask from the first dimension.
otherwise k + axis <= n.
i expect this behavior: tf.tensor([ 0 11 0 10 9 0 0 12], shape=(8,), dtype=int32) tf.tensor([ 11 10 9 12], shape=(8,), dtype=int32) tf.tensor([ 11 10 9 12], shape=(8,), dtype=int32) otherwise i need to find unique indices and delete multiples.
and why it is adding?
maybe other options are possible then too.
i expect that memory should be cleaned.
the expected output of the code below should be `<tf.tensor: id=4, shape=(), dtype=string,
the speed should be always very fast (about 7s/100iterations).
the values of non-zero elements in sparse weight matrices with fixed indices should be trainable.
regardless of tfl converter optimization, prediction on
convolutional layer in the tensorflow model should remain the same even after tfliteconverter.
tf.placeholder and tf.sparse.placeholder have the same behavior.
the expectation was to get one compiled xla cluster for each replica.
i would expect the names to match the layer names that the output comes from.
the custom ops themselves should work with tpus so i can train on tpus without compromising the performance of my data pipeline.
i would have expected logging to place a minimal overhead cost on training performance.
perhaps related to the `tf.function` compilation?
should broadcast the same value to all devices?
i tried this in python2 and there is no such issue.
could you look into it?
metric values should not get mixed up
i read in tutorial phofhyperlink that wrapping iteration through the dataset with tf.function should increase performance, but instead of it computations move from gpu to cpu and as result slow down.
i can fix this behavior by manual device placement, by i think that computations should be done on gpu by default.
since cudnn force to behave determinisically = 'true '), and all the data/parameter/loss are the same, grad is expected to be same.
gfile should support the python io semantics that supports seeking on a write only file.
more generally it would be preferable if gfile followed the api of python 's `io.iobase` phofhyperlink .
the model should be trained normally.
the model information should be shown.
no error and the result should be 4
comparing if something == none and is none should have the same behavior
it should work, and run faster than eager mode.
should be able to create a trt model using the latest docker build.
read on an empty `w+` file should return an empty string.
one problem with the current behavior is that numpy.savez() crashes when writing to a gfile.
there should only be this many equal signs: not
replicas shouldn't peek empty batches from dried out iterator.
beta1 used to throw an exception in this case.
or expects generator to always return number of batches dividable by number of replicas
it 's expected that, assuming the pasted code is correct that the predict() function should result in same output as the train() output.
however, running predict() throws the error above.
i have tested this on both tensorflow==1.14.0 and tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0 both with

when i set inter=1 and intra=1, i expect the usage of cpu is limited to <= 100%.
indicate the source of the problem/possible resolution.
i was expecting that since the batch size is unknown until runtime, that tensorflow would be able to handle this error, similar to how tensorflow can accept an unknown dimension and generate a matrix/tensor with the unknown shape.

as a tensorflow package, i would expect the `tf.io.gfile` functions to allow the use of scalar string tensors, or i would expect tensorflow to provide a solution similar to the `.numpy()` function inside `tf.function` for these cases.
if not, at least it should be a warning in the documentation that these functions cannot be used inside `tf.function`.
specifying an optimizer as variable instead of with a string and default parameters should work.
i want to run the object detection app on gpu by using gpu experimental with a self-converted ssd model.
i will be run another cell in jupyter notebook, but i can't.
i would expect that using @tf.function decorator for the train function would compute the gradient update steps in a similar amount of time as model.fit().
i am wondering if the model is not being put onto gpu and is kept on cpu when trained this way.
- please implement or suggest a way to release gpu memory being used by unneeded models in google colab/jupter notebooks.
- it would be nice to be able to release memory being used by specific models (that are no longer necessary) rather than resetting the runtime every time i run out of memory (which is often).
- some way to build models so that the gpu memory they occupy gets automatically released when they go out of scope would also be appreciated.
i believe that from user point of view it would consistent if both examples gives exactly the same output- there is no difference in architecture.
it would be better if sigmoid is applied, no matter what are the initialization arguments of binarycrossentropy.
1. tensorflow documentation should state clearly the preferred way to use `tf.keras` models inside `tf.estimator`, given the knowledge that `tf.estimator` is built on `tf.keras.layers` and thus the expectation that interops is seamless.
2. the discrepancy between training with `tf.keras` and `tf.estimator` + `tf.keras` should be minimal or non-existent
the all_reduce tensor `reduced_weight` gives proper answer on all workers.
the mnist.py script is supposed to to achieve >99% test accuracy after 12 epochs of training.
doing a clean install of tensorflow-gpu=1.13 and running the script achieves this result.
- tensorflow gpu version: 1.13 - python version: 3.7.3 - cuda version: - cudnn version: 7.6.0 this discrepancy between versions exists even when setting the numpy and tensorflow random seeds before training.
there are potentially major implications for the reproducibility of any work done in tensorflow across these versions.
why is this happening and/or how can it be fixed?
possibility to save models with `tf.saved_model.save` as they would be saveable with `model.save`.
hope to have a tf c++ kernel for this op, then it could call the kernel directly to get good cache locality on cpu or reduce memory access on gpu.
can train large model using without memory issue, like
set tf_cpp_min_log_level=2 should prevent showing information/warning logs including libpng warnings.
keras.model.fit passes sparsetensors as is.
i would like to be able to run symbolic tensors through a while loop without disabling eager execution (basically, i would like eager execution not to take away practical functionalities which are very useful in designing models without having to put up small hacks of the framework, which are bound decrease readability and stability).
i expect that using the --use_nnapi=true flag will also display op profiling information
no error occurs and training continues.
because of the identical implementations, besides the difference in the way the model is built (subclassing and functional api), i would expect results to be same.
in other words, i am confused why an exception is raised at all if using model subclassing.
this issue was resolved upstream in keras in keras-team/keras#8977 if `merge_mode` is used in bidirectional, it should merge the returned state from each wrapped gru even if `return_state=true, return_sequences=false` is set.
the frozen model does not seem to be corrupted because i was able to deploy the other version successfully.
fake_quant should inherently be supported.

tensorflow lite can run float16 model with gpu delegate correctly.
passing the a dataset object to `estimator.fit` method results in the following error: phofcode
the division operation should be used to convert the floating point to quantized fixed point value and the corresponding tests changes respectively.
i'm expecting the model to learn _something_ - which doesn't mean that i'm expecting it to achieve a specific accuracy.
in other words, i'm expecting the network's weights to be updated after a training step.
not failing with when subclassing.
the integration test here, phofurl didn 't catch this problem.
is there a way to optimize the tensorflow codes to have comparable performance?
i would like to save the model.
the expected behavior is to get the same result running the model in android that when i run the model in python
the mirroredvariable class phofhyperlink is a subclass of the distributeddelegate class phofhyperlink , which if i understand correctly, means that `mirroredvariables` are supposed to act like regular tensors that you can perform ops on.
this works fine with most standard ops, like multiplication, division, subtraction, etc.
however, if you try to use any `tf.math` ops, you get `typeerror: failed to convert object of type <class to tensor`.
should not throw the above error.
i would expect the mask to be propagated as if the inner layers were not in a `sequential` layer.
the fetched result should be the value of the variable.
i expect to find some value for `dataset.prefetch()` that reads all or enough data to memory to allow for fast training without stalling.
which one is correct set we can see queuedequeuev2 is on
i expect tf.gather to work for the case in which the params argument is an attribute of the tf.keras.layers.layer, just as it does for the other cases mentioned.
tf.signal.stft should work as it does without eager execution
without the distributed strategy, i can readily pass a batch size of 300 to a given gpu, within the distributed strategy, this drops to 200 on 2 gpus, and 70 on 4 gpus.
in keras 2.2.4, fit_generator simply calls the next(gen) function on the generator provided to fit_generator().
this is working as expected.
* writing to tensorboard (*console parameter = false*) tensorboard event file which contains the distribution and histograms of gradients derived from the total loss that has been accumulated over the last epoch.
* priniting to console(*console parameter = true*) the program should print the first 10 gradient bias values of each of two dense layer to console.
if exceptions produced here are expected behavior due to errors in developers code a more meaningful error message would be appriciated.
in that case a correction of code would be useful for me and other people as well who had update their code as * write_grads * parameter has been removed from tensorboard callback in version 2.0.
i would expect it to work in both modes similar.
i can use batch renormalisation under mirrored strategy.
the metal gpu delegate gives the same output as the cpu interpreter.
reduce memory cost to about 500kb per line.
no assertion, as i computed the values by hand and expect them to be right.
the sum should be 3.
the model should train on two gpus asynchronously.
the return value should be
when using `x.to_tensor(...)` on the elements of the dataset, the shape should be evaluated to the shape of tensor.
i do not believe such a huge gap comes from bn/dropout or the batch difference, i doubt there is a bug in computing the loss in keras.model.fit()?
besides, i print the prediction result array.
the value changes from different inputs are very small, it seems to me this is under-fitting?
however, from the loss curve i cannot deduce it..(more like a over-fitting case to me..).
could you please help to figure it out?
running the model completes successfully.
it must return the value of the collection keyed by tf.graphkeys.init_op, in this case it should be something like loss/init type noop
it should not throw errors and initialize all variables.
i expect both the `tf 1.x` and `tf 2.0` ways of predicting from a `savedmodel` to be serializable phofcode let me know if i am approaching this problem the wrong way!
sqrt(2) should be computed the same way every time.
theoretically (x @ y) and (y.t @ x.t).t should evaluate to same value and their value should be same as numpy version.
shape is not lost supposedly fixed here #16052
according to the docs: phofcode the data should not be included in the data.
tf.function does not change the behavior of any operations on tensors.
either exception is thrown or the code is executed every time.
as it is, it just welcomes bugs.
tflite should output the same result with pbfile when using only one convolutional layer.
the graph should freeze no matter the phofcode parameter.
the code should calculate gradient properly without error.
the custom ops run correctly in inferring mode, however, it throws bug during `model.fit` or below: phofcode
auto deeplab keeps going as expected
my expectation was that if i pass a tf.variable as the learning_rate argument to and later assign a new value to the variable, that would affect the optimization.
according to the documentation phofhyperlink it should be possible to pass a "callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to use" as learning_rate to and this "can be useful for changing these values across different invocations of optimizer functions".
my expectation was that the adam optimizer would keep calling the supplied callable at each update (i.e.
model fits without any problems, like the same model without embedding layer (no _dest_input_).
i would expect custom loss functions to work irrespective of batch size and sample weights.
the `kernel initializer` should be changed to `he_uniform` in `conv`, `separableconv`, `depthwiseconv` and `dense` layers from this __init__( filters, kernel_size, strides=(1, 1), padding='valid', data_format=none, dilation_rate=(1, 1), activation=none, use_bias=true, kernel_regularizer=none, bias_regularizer=none, kernel_constraint=none, bias_constraint=none,
correct serialization and deserialization of the code in both cases.
correct serialization and deserialization of the code
calling `tf.gradients` with returns appropriately shaped zero tensors for unconnected resource variables.
hyperparameters do update on the first run, ie they are initialized to tf.variables at constructor of the optimizer, not on first call.
should not throw the above error.
the training speed should improve much more when going from config_gpu_0 to config_gpu_4 and it should improve by more than a factor of 2 when going from config_gpu_4 to config_gpu_8 (notice that in addition to using twice as many gpus, each gpu in config_gpu_8 is v100 which is in itself should be much more powerful than p100 in config_gpu_4).
factorize the matrix and evaluate without the error.
assuming my previous issue is solved, i think that the result of `plot_model` should simply look like this phofimage .
i got values but are not the same with the same image tested with ckpt files.
significant reduce in the amount of warnings, ideally to zero.
already had to use tf.float32)` to prevent some errors.
dataset should iterate as it does in eager mode without `tf.function` decorator.
the expected behaviour would be that the output number for conv2d_layers is at the same position as for usual conv2d_layers.
this problem is independent of the data_format and saving/loading procedures.
the loss and accuracy of model trained by tf.gradienttape should be similar to the one trained by keras fit with the same settings
*according to issue 36175: identity of bound methods - python tracker phofhyperlink this is supposed to be expected behavior in python.
i merely want to clarify the autograph behavior and document this for other tensorflow users.
* i guess there might be reasons to use identity (`is`) comparison on arguments when deciding whether an autograph needs retracing, but if it were possible use equality comparison (`==` ) for arguments that are methods this surprising behavior could be avoided.
calling the model should return a tensor, not throw an exception.
here is the result with cpu: cpu phofimage
we expect the model to run and build predictions.
should be able to save and reload models that have been saved under mirror strategy.
succesful training with distribute strategy when tf.py_function called in dataset.map.
the dilated convolution can estimate the output shape as convolution op does.
want to be able to use tfrecord data set with words and graph to lookup indexes via tf table and then parallel lookup imbedding vectors; compute using 3 dim tensor.
this used to work with smaller set of embeddings.
anyway overcome this problem without rewriting data feed?
should save a checkpoint model file and not crash
should not return this error
the converter should not reorder operations across reshape if it would cause the dimensions to no longer match.
in addition, the check failure message should provide more information about the location of the error, such as originating layer names (which are visible in graphviz outputs).
i am trying to quantize two different yolo models (one tiny, one normal) with tensorrt.
the goals of this quantization are: 1. speed up inference 2. decrease model size as quantization and conversion proceeds from i expect inference time to decrease (fps to increase), and model size to decrease.
release compiled model when i don 't need it anymore
the print out of the difference should be zero.
i think `-0.5f` is more reasonable
i should get no exception.
reproducible prediction from same input instance, independent of row number or input length.
i use generalized "row" for a slice of a tensor with a given fixed first index, e.g., `x[i,,]` or `pred[i,]`.
the expected behavior is for this error to not occur, and for the int8 calibrated and quantized graph to be produced correctly.
`model.fit` should train the model, and model weights should be saved in desired files.
the output of `tf.nn.conv2d` should not be different w.r.t batch sizes.
returns only the operations from name scope, and preferable shorted by construction just like in the original list.
return the batch size as plain tf.
i would expect tensorflow has similar or better performance after the upgrade.
variable `__main__` should keep its value `"__main__"` so it can be used to determine if the python code is imported as a module/library or the entry point of a script.
the training is expected to work correctly even with distributed scope turned off.
this was working correctly in the tf2.0 alpha release but is an issue in the tf2.0 beta1 release.
although we clearly shouldn't be passing an empty tensor to this method, i would expect an exception to occur (in python) explaining that the input is invalid, rather than a segfault.
my understanding is that both gcc 5 and python 3.6 are both supported when building and running custom ops, so the code that uses the op should be able to run fine without segfaulting.
it should most likely work, as it was possible in tensorflow 1.x.
model has both inputs after loading.
should work as before and without any error messages
it should be possible to include `none`-sized axes in the `noise_shape` argument to which are expanded at run-time to the actual size of that axis in the input tensor of the layer.
model will compile and train without issue.
as it does without the `@tf.function` decorator.
i was expecting the keras training logging to be printed post model.fit().
it doesn 't appear to be training at all.
i expect to see calculated shape with none only in first dimension
should work out of the box as before
you get a neat concise overview of training on the linux ec2 installations.
just as it should be.
using should destroy the graph/session when either the max steps has been reached, or the input_fn raises an `outofrangeerror`
`dense` should flatten its input like the documentation says.
in the first example bellow, the shape of the kernel weights of `dense` should be `(5 * 3, 2)` = `(15, 2)` instead of `(3, 2)`, which is shape of `dense2` (as expected in case `dense2`).
as you can guess, it would be expected to run without failure.
note that using the .tflite model given by the tflite object detection example script produces no error with the same picture (although it wouldn 't yield any pertinent result).
training proceed normally when the `class_weight` parameter is included without running out of memory.
restoring the model should succeed.
the exception is never raised if the dataset does not contain string data, iteration stops and the rest of the code is executed.
i should be able to run python code on the cpu as part of my input pipeline when training on tpus.
expected behavior is latency when i parse the feature before hand and feed in per feature tensor , there is lesser work for tensorflow to do , so it should be faster or at worse the same ?
why do we observe 2-3x higher latency ?
is this due to the way feed dictionary gets copied from python to c++ ?
the model can be saved successfully.
the training runs with `dilation_rate == 2`.
using `tf.function` when enumerating a dataset should not change the looping behavior.
the memory shouldn't grow indefinitely as it did in tf 1.12. see the memory timeseries for tf 1.12 below: ai_job_mem_ok phofimage
it should work, but doesn't.
the tf.keras.model should return expected value rather than raising a error.
was expecting to see higher throughput with tf-trt.
compile a model more than once without the gpu running out of memory.
more specifically, be able to hyper-parameter tuning without restarting the jupyter kernel.
i 've tried: - set_memory_growth on the gpu - del model + gc.collect - clear_session none of them help.
i was hoping for a more explicit error message.
like with using an integer valued sparsetensor i expect tf.sparse.to_dense to return a dense tensor with string values.
successfully import the graph_transforms module.
this code succesfully run with tf 1.13 but failed on tf 1.14.
gpu device creation should succeed if the user specifies use of the cuda malloc allocator.
i expect file sizes and inference time to decrease.
with `mirroredstrategy`, the model is expected to be run in parallel.
models whose layers have shared/tied weights should not return duplicate weights when accessing the trainable_variables property.
a super simple work-around is to call but the real issue is the unexpected behavior: "why would i ever think that would return duplicates of the same variable ?!"
the two calls to test in code below should have same output.
the resulting `tensor` should have a scalar value, consistent with its static shape.
the element shape of the `tensorarray` should be partially known, consistent with the behavior of an equivalent `tf.while_loop`.
i would like this function to work faster for 8k size images.
expect to see a normal run since the variables are initialized inside the conv2d function
in the above example `for i in y:print(i.numpy())` should produce result without attributeerror.
i expect some groups of nodes / subgraphs to be converted into trtengineops so that they can run in tensorrt.
according to the supported ops phofhyperlink , the following operators could / should have been somewhat simplified into trtengineops: `const`, `mul`, `conv2d`, `fusedbatchnorm`, `maxpool`, `identity`, `biasadd`, `concatv2`, `reshape`, `sigmoid`, `exp`, `add`, and `sub`.
in fact, this is nearly all the operators, save for `placeholder`, `transpose`, `leakyrelu`, `resizenearestneighbor`, and `splitv`.
it is expected that the above script produces pbtxt file similar to the one provided by google for its mobilenet ssd model.
calling `.map` on a `tf.data.dataset` should leave available imports intact.
the contents should be identical.
i expect there to be no error message!
this error message should be formatted and it should highlight exactly which input is incompatible.
otherwise this can become a needle in a haystack and gets annoying real quick
sample rate output of decode_wav can be used as input to
the linking process should be performed successfully and produce a library file called zero_out.so.
i can understand that eager execution would create a slight overhead, however here it proves huge, while no mechanism whatsoever requires it.
i do not know what can be done about it _per se_, but if such an overhead is to be expected, i think it would be nice to be able to disable eager in 2.0. and i mean _properly_ disabling it, not using `tf.compat` instructions that are bound to wiped out at some point.
alternatively, believe that it could great enable using "old-style" (not eager) tensors as layer weights through, _e.g._, a boolean option, so that in the settings when accessing those weights (as eager tensors) is not required (which, believe, is a majority of cases, especially when some keras methods allow effectively pull out the weights as numpy arrays), no overhead would implied by a (seemingly) useless eager declaration.
of course, might missing an existing feature allowing do so, in which case would most glad pointed way optimize run times when execution is enabled (maybe by enforcing the isolation of the operations in compiled graph?
no error is raised and the (joint) initial state is properly distributed by the `bidirectional` between the underlying forward and backward `lstm` instances.
no warnings should be come from the tensorflow header.
there should be no error, and ops should be assigned to their appropriate devices (cpu vs gpu).
compute_bleu.py should work, but does not (only when i replace newstest2014.de with an older version (text format)
lstm/gru supporting zero masking, and having no impact of training speed
as mentioned, yesterday the models were running perfectly fine and i expected the same to happen today as i have made no changes to my software/hardware in between.
i think keras layer/model should have `output_shape`, but they aren 't.
please see if it 's intended.
i 've just started to migrate from tf 1.x to tf 2.0 and to use keras apis, so i might be wrong when using keras api.
the pointer should not be null.
(i have also tested it on mac os, and it works fine.
but on linux, it gives a null pointer.)
is saved as padding is same.
i see all bounding boxes (ground thruth) in the tensorboard>images (pictures on the right)
the memory allocated by an invocation of a`call` method using `tf.linalg.expm` should be freed.
number of `call` invocations plotted against memory allocated in gigabytes phofimage
no errors when used correctly (maybe that is the issue).
code runs without causing an error
multiple calls to `predict` should not degrade in performance over time when passing in a dataset.
it is expected the post-training quantisation method to accept networks with multiple placeholders.
trying the same code as below in other networks that has only one placeholder works as expected (although the reference implementations of quantise/de-quantise which are located at the beginning and at end of network is extremely slow, but this is another issue).
with alpha0 and the same code the history looks as follows: alpha 0 phofimage an upgrade of the tensorflow version should not affect the resulting accuracy in such a manner.
the predicted output tensor for a given input tensor should always produce the same result regardless of the size of the batch the sample is found in.
tpu distribution strategy should be able to implement this
it should produce outputs as the masked timestamps should be filled zeros if zero_output_for_mask is true.
if false, the masked timestamps should be filled with previous outputs.
i expect to be able to reuse the input bytebuffer with updated contents across multiple inference calls
it should print "geforce rtx 2080 with max-q design" (as pytorch does).
<tf.tensor: id=xxx, shape=(2, 1), dtype=float32, numpy=array([[1.
<tf.tensor: id=xxx, shape=(2, 1), dtype=float32, numpy=array([[1.
now the concatenate function works properly when using a sequential model.
that is, if i swap in "for i in range(1):" rather than "for i in range(3):" above, the code executes cleanly.
however, the non-sequential repeated concatenation in the loop leaves a graph disconnected error.
furthermore, error is also eliminated when using tf.concat, so following code also executes cleanly.
phofcode therefore, i do have a working alternative, but there does appear to be an issue with keras concatenate functio
this sample code should run.
editing out the skip connection makes the code run fine.
do note that i have successfully used the reshape functionality just fine in straight feedforward models.
for some reason, this bug crops up when using reshape in a skip connection as shown in the sample code below.
simple models, or not optimized work.
while adding to the loop helps, this should not be necessary because in eager execution there is no graph to clear, which according to the documentation phofhyperlink seems to be the only thing this function does: > destroys the current tf graph and creates a new one.
therefore it is also suprising that this function helps at all during eager execution.
the expected behavior is that there is no memory leak even without
each of the 4 gpus should indicate that memory is being copied to the device and processed.
if i look at the tensor before and after the depthwise_conv2d the channel number should be preserved, and look something like this: phofcode so imo depthwise_conv2d with dilations and nchw it 's loosing the information about number of channels
tflite model should be able to load and execute.
tflite to actually use gpu when running conv2d networks
produce kind of the same results for the same models (no matter c=1 or c=3) for cpu host tf and tflite and android tflite on cpu and gpudelegate.
either all the metrics should be created with the exact same name, or they should all have an integer added to the end of the second metric with that name.
expected to fit the model without errors.
gpudelegate should load correctly and run inference on my android devices.
need to flush gpu data at each iteration so it won 't run out of memory
i expect my .tflite model to behave the same as my tensorflow .h5 model.
but it always predicts the first class label with the same probability score.
i 've tried converting to .tflite with tf-gpu versions 1.14, 1.13, nightly 1.14 and tf-2.0.0-beta1
`tf.io.write_file` should create an output file whether or not being decorated with `@tf.function`.
the two snippets of code above should be equivalent, that is, they should both run successfully.
i was expecting it to work the same whether i define my input layer as an input layer or as tf.random.uniform() tensor.
the bias vectors should be shaped as they were in the original freeze graph model.
`tf.cast` should not change the bit representation of values.
can we change them back to list for the single tensor case?
save a png image of the model.
in 1.13, `__dict__` had a mapping of every tensorflow functions and `__doc__` had printed out ` 'bring in all of the public tensorflow interface into this module.
'` the full log for printing `__dict__` can be seen as below phofcode
the expected behavior would be that the last 2 dimensions don't swap which is the case for all conv2d layers.
this occurs only in the conv2d_transpose layers.
when running without dilation im able to handle the variable sized input.
also the fact that the conv layers with dilation can handle any input as long as its the first i would expect that no additional padding would be needed.
everything works fine when i define the dataset on the previous line like this: phofcode
tpu estimator should run without `steps` or `max_steps` as mentioned in the documentation.
it should stop the training process as soon as rises.
the program should always be the initial state of 190mb without memory leaks.
just return a bytestring of a 16bit png
when training and validating on an identical sample, the model should get the same accuracy during both training and validation.
to eliminate the possibility that this is caused by a difference between the running mean/variance and batchwise mean/variance, a very small value of batchnorm momentum was trialed.
it was observed that modifying momentum appears to have no effect.
batchnorm should not affect a model 's ability to make good predictions.
memory is released after `sess.run` and closing session, like in case 3 above but for gpu.
only cache the dataset once and not throw an error.
save model should produce a correct savedmodel in non-eager mode so that it can be loaded later.
i think the phofcode function should continue training without crashing.
i think that we only need to define the self.dense(200) only once, but we can reuse it in the def call(self, x)
it should import fine, i've copied code directly from the official tensorflow keras getting started guides.
based off of the documentation: > tf.bitcast ( input, type, name=none ) > given a tensor _input_, this operation returns a tensor that has the same buffer data as _input_ with datatype _type_.
i expected that a change and return to the original data type, without modifying the buffer data would not cause that amount of decrease to network 's accuracy.
function composition should be working properly.
i would expect it to allocate no more than 50% memory.
in my case, it would be <=2021.5 mb.
should generate a good .tflite file
this is different from tf 1.13.1 where it works as expected: phofcode missing spec causes some problems, e.g.
pkgutil now fails when trying to find tensorflow.
note that the first call to `find_loader` is successful, it only fails * after * tensorflow is imported: phofcode
masking should be supported: phofurl if a layer supports masking, it should be a kwarg to __call__.
until all layers support masking, it's not practical to only support masking via an upstream layer.
a masking layer can't always be inserted into a model because downstream convolution layers don't support it at all.
feeding the mask into the call of a recurrent layer is the only workaround to combine convolution, lstm and masking, and it would be great if it worked the same way for batchnorm: phofcode .
there should not be a memory leak.
the initializable iterator is saved and restored properly, behaving the same with the one shot iterator.
the model runs as described in the tutorial.
i should be able to save the file.
create maximal num_threads and limit context switches.
it is expected the warning is written to stderr.
when any value of -h, -help, -helpshort, -helpfull are provided as arguments to scripts using `tf.app.flags`, the help list should appear.
i 'd expect `slice` to have shape `tensorshape([none, 10, 5])`.
the code below won 't generate any errors.
i expect this operation to be quicker, as (afaik) it is needed for any complex operations involving tf.scatter_nd and other element gathering ops.
tensorflow documentation for states that: "when eager execution is enabled, this function returns a function which in turn returns the decayed learning rate tensor"
no error, it was working in 1.13.
i am expecting that i can get a custom model to work on the coral tpu.
(i 'm assuming i 'm doing something a bit wrong but i am having so much trouble figuring out what i 'm doing wrong)
the code in the function passed as an argument to .map() should not be run until the generator has yielded a value for it to operate on, or an input argument for map allowing this behavior to be specified should be added.
if this is actually the intended behavior, that should be made more clear in the documentation for .map()
i think that we should not get warnings about deprecated objects when we are not calling any deprecated method, attribute, etc.
i think that somewhere in the code of the `call` method of `densefeatures` and `sequencefeatures` there is a use of `_num_buckets` that should be replaced by `num_buckets`.
following the updating instructions about the third warning may be enough to get rid of it.
i think `sequencefeatures` `call` should accepts dense `tensor` objects and just don 't try to convert them from sparse to dense.
each multiprocessing process should be only able to see one gpu and be forced to use that: however, neither are being detected.
here is the expected output: phofcode
being able to use a dataset only for training but a numpy array for validation data.
input-data-types are preserved when converting keras-model to estimator.
keras layers should use sensible default behavior and not have this smearing issue.
this causes serious problems for autoencoders, gans, and cost months of time.
correct behavior is seen with tf.image.resize(o, size=size, keras upsampling should use this as the default instead of the current defective behavior.
note: in tensorflow 1.x, the tf.image.resize method had an 'align_corners ' parameter that toggled between defective and proper behavior and was set to false (defective behavior) by default.
in tensorflow 2, this parameter has been removed the correct behavior (align_corners=true behavior) is now default.
the keras layer should follow same path.
when run on tf 1.12 , log.txt is created and the logging is being recorded correctly.
i tested all variables, all of them are tf.tensor
i expect it to work as advertised.
tflite micro 's fastint32tobufferleft phofhyperlink causes error c4146 `unary minus operator applied to unsigned type, result still unsigned` on visual c++.
meanwhile, tensoflow 's implementaion has no problem.
this issue can be solved by rewriting `u = -u;` to `u = 0 - u;` as follows.
* tflite micro 's fastint32tobufferleft phofhyperlink phofcode * tensorflow 's fastint32tobufferleft phofhyperlink phofcode
since we only know the end() is called before closing the session.
i think the changed result should be store in the chekpoint.
otherwise, document should provide ordering of executing all hooks.
the trained model should achieve similar level of accuracy regardless of virtual devices (0.9938) or physical devices (0.9698).
given a batched ragged tensor `x`, manually building a new one using `tf.raggedtensor.
currently this raise an exception at runtime (not during graph construction).
i would expect roughly the same training accuracy after 1000 steps for each test.
when using the @tf.function decorator a much greater accuracy is achieved for the same model type, number of epochs, number of batches, and dataset compared to a training run not using @tf.function.
it would be nice if this dataset could execute in graph mode.
i would expect the epochs to to through smoothly, i actually suspect the validation part, because it is failing exactly before it.
it 's supposed to train the model and not throw the error.
no warning and building a graph successfully.
basically just as it is now, without increasing used memory every single time i do the inference.
the following structure is expected.
phofurl ~~~ assets/ assets.extra/ variables/ variables.index ~~~ my final target is to optimizing tensorflow serving performance with nvidia tensorrt phofhyperlink , and the model that i want to launch is a pre-trained mask-rcnn downloaded from tensorflow_model_zoo phofhyperlink any help would be grateful
the gradient is calculated and returned after calling tf.session.run,
we can import tensor_util in tf 1.13.
finish conversion without any errors.
no error model phofcode error phofcode
the training should finish after the set number of epochs.
i expect this script to finish normally.
since the model behavior should be consistent.
tf team should decide weather to support dict type inputs.
if no, both model should not accept dict input and vice versa.
the behavior goes away and works without problem if i comment out the loggingtensorhook parts, yet i have no idea what 's the relevant issue.
the training fails with a very vague exception, which only says that the last op(tf.reduce_mean() in my case) has been marked as not fetchable, and no other useful information provided.
it makes it almost impossible to find the actual cause of problem since exception points to wrong op, reduce_mean(), which was actually not problem.
we expect same loss from both train and train2.
( is it because, some internal parameters are changing inside the optimizer, because sgd optimizer works fine in both the cases).
should work, especially since already successfully loaded into the python process, and so did cudnn64_7.dll
`setshapefn` should get meaningful ptr.
it have no error when i run code with tf-2.0.0-alpha but the error happend with beta version tensorflow
a possible conversion from the `deferredtensor` to a `tensor` or `eagertensor`, or alternatively to perform group normalization in another way.
since i have many networks served on the same gpu, i would like them to take as low vram as possible.
each of them being in a separated process (easier to schedule).
finding the good for each neural network is a bit complicated since i have to grope.
it works in gpu version seemlessly
having looked at the source code, i would expect `on_epoch_end` to be triggered at the end of each epoch
all models work as good as your hosted model
it should be "0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = one line per epoch."
i expect that the latest post training quantization should remain as fast as the one in version 1.10.
log the metrics and loss as described in the official docs [ phofurl phofcode
graph mode should always be faster than eager mode.
graph mode in tf2.0 should be at least approximately as fast as graph mode in tf 1.x.
i expect to get the same variable names in a layer no matter how layer is used.
able to correctly link to the framework.
i expect the dataset to be reshuffled after each epoch.
right now, it 's not, even when i use in the dataset 's `shuffle()` method.
this argument seems to only shuffle between iterations within one epoch.
i 'd like to set keras model 's run_eagerly property to true so that i 'd be able to step into custom-defined loss functions when being in eager mode when using sgd as an optimiser.
i assume that the mse should be equivalent to the mae squared but i may be wrong.
either the save_model should always work (i believe this is a feature goal) and the documentation should reflect this, or if the save is likely to produce incorrect results it should raise an error and the documentation should continue to suggest that custom models can only be saved with save_weights feature.
the code should work as it did in the earlier release ie tf2.0 alpha
the framework should be named
an exception should be thrown when the condition in phofcode is not met.
convert into a singe depthwise_conv_2d v2(dilation=2)
run the number of iteration as specified in the `run -t` command
i would expect training and validation loss to be constant throughout training and equal to each other
i would expect tf 1.11 to be as fast or faster as tf 1.10
the output sequence should match the input, even when the batch dimensions are greater than 1. why do batch dimensions need to be 1?
the commit that introduced this behavior is: phofurl
whether default or reverse control dependency is used between layers should not have any implications on the gradients seen in dummy c++ op for a given layer, since we are running a predictable model, with same datasets.
the crossshardoptimizer shouldn 't break.
wrapper should succesfully apply to layer; previously worked in tf 1.11.0.
i want to be able to see the results of each step of the variable at runtime through
it would be expected that both keras 's should be operational.
i am also not mixing and matching keras and tf.keras layers.
models created will be collected by gc, and memory usage go down to initial level
we only need decorate the outermost method.
the expected behavior should be the same as simplernn (re-sample dropout masks on each call).
the tensorflow.keras function `load_weights` to have the same syntax as keras's.
the performance on my gcp instance should be the same with gcolab since everything is the same
the benchmark script finishes normally and prints performance numbers, as only a single-day of commits before on with (we run into this with our in-house untested nightly build at
tensorflow doesn 't throw oom errors.
i expect correct model loading behavior from both checkpoint and hdf5.
`dict` objects wrapped around `_dictwrapper` by `autotrackable` are serializable by pickle.
tflite gpu supported ops, must run in gpu.
if there are unsupported ops in the graph for which execution cannot be done, execution must fall back to cpu.
i would expect the shape of x to be: dimension(3), dimension(4)])
wrapping the optimizer in a lossscaleoptimizer should work transparently with keras models, as it implements tf.optimizers.optimizer base class.
to solve this problem, there 's a need to either pass undelying optimizer variables() method (together with passing lossscalemanager variables too) or fill slot- and non-slot variables some other way.
if `repeat()` is being invoked, repeat the dataset.
sparse and ragged tensors should be acceptable input for keras models.
the random seed set via should be set in the context in which the functions passed to `tf.data.dataset#map` are invoked, at least for the single thread case.
the tflite model should perhaps be considerably smaller.
[the frozen graph i'm using]( phofurl
the results are shown on the website.
for a low loss of 0.03, the true positives should be close to 50k.
however they 're shown to be 8k only.
build tflite + opengl delegate successfully with cmake and perform correctly on my aarch64 board.
`tf.function` with an input signature should behave like graph mode with constant memory usage and no "warmup" phase.
the code should print the list of trainable variables of the net.
the output is correct so the `__call__` method is correctly called.
models of the same version should be identical.
any modification should be explicitly documented
i would not expect arithmeticoptimizer to fail.
no cpu memory leak when training models on gpu device using 'tf.function '.
i would expect to be able to train an lstm using `sample_weight` and `batch_size > 1`.
as far as i understand it, `sample_weight` can be used for weighting the loss function, and according to the docs phofhyperlink it can be "a flat (1d) numpy array with the same length as the input samples" - i.e.
in tf v1, the dataset instance should inherit from `datasetv1`, not `datasetv2`.
the code to be converted correctly
i think the behavior of training data and validation data in keras `model.fit` should be consistent.
this would make keras a lot easier to use together with `tf.data` because it gets rid of the need for defining a exact number of steps.
train the keras estimator without errors
the tensorflow lite model should run without errors in gpu and cpu with element-wise operators.
valid gradient for the weights in the sparsetensor whatever the number of calls done previously to the model.
this code should correctly utilize my gpus.
same output as making predictions immediately after training.
i would expect only as many iterations as specified by `steps_per_epoch` in each iteration.
while it 's possible i have misunderstood something, this is the behavior in tensorflow 1 when i run analogous code.
the aws s3 implementation should be able to handle weird path
calling `model.predict(x, steps=n)` on both an uncompiled (1) and compiled (2)`tf.keras.model` should produce a list of numpy arrays corresponding to the outputs of the model without any errors.
the model should be loaded correctly and then run the inference.
i would expect both, the model trained with keras fit and the model trained with a custom training loop, to converge.
the job should keep training without failure
`tf.data.dataset::cache` should produce a similar file compared to the input tfrecord files.
python3 type hinting should not fail the code.
same output as running on colab: image phofimage
model generation should behave the same from a memory point of view regardless of whether the input shape is specified or not.
all 592 examples in my dataset should be processed (with the counter being 592 afterwards).
i expect `tf.make_ndarray()` to return a numpy array as advertised :)
i expected less memory usage from this lite tool.
given the initial high gpu volatile utilization rate, i was expecting the high util-rate to persist, so it was a bit strange to see that after the initial 3k steps, the training process only occasionally used gpu, and mostly relied on cpu.
any pointers/help would be much appreciated.
both the "predict" signature, and the "serving_default" signature definitions should be in the saved_model.
code was removed near these lines in trt_convert.py when the code was restructured in r1.14 branch: phofurl the original code in v1.13.1 tagged version looped through all of signature definitions: phofurl
np.matmul(a, b) should be very close to tf.matmul(a, b) when a, b are both float64s.
this issue is compounding over a spectrogram preprocessing pipeline making tensorflow unusable for pushing my signal preprocessing from numpy into tensorflow.
tensorflow lite should correctly read a flatbuffers tflite file and build an internal model structure for its interpreter without any errors.
it should not throw any type of error during training.
the iterator should cleanup incomplete cache files if finished or if the process exits.
this would be really handy when running multiple runs on the machine and if processes might error or finish before the cache has been complete.
without distribution strategy everything works fine.
i think the second evaluation should also work, because i use padding="same"
in ubuntu 16.04, build succeeds with the following: `info: build completed successfully, 3560 total actions` then a tfcompile_test executable would be produced in which can be run successfully.
using graph mode `tf.data` caching works using distribution strategy and doesn 't throw an error.
this function should handle these primitive types
the keras callback `set_model` method should be called after the whole model is populated.
i would expect that the convolutional weights are visualized.
i know this would be a huge amount of images (c_in * c_out), but i think the current behavior is confusing.
i'd expect gpu performance to be (significantly) better than 4-thread cpu.
granted it's not a great gpu, but i'd expect it to be substantially faster than the cpu.
gpu memory should be controled
it works for model built with tf.contrib.slim.
i feels like the doesn 't support bn layer from tf.keras.
keras .fit is just a wrapper why would it be way faster???
they should be the same on the same dataset with the same loss func and optimizer.
when passing `steps_per_epoch` to `model.fit` as a parameter when training on data fed via a instance the model should be updated exactly `steps_per_epoch` times in every epoch.
this very simple defun'd function should execute quickly, including the graph-building and graph optimization steps.
i expect the code to return a single number.
random output should be different on each call in both graph and eager modes.
the tensor with tensor 's shape (2,) is the correct output when apllying flat_map to a dataset containing x sample, each consting of two values.
creating a variable should be completed within acceptable time.
the net loads and runs fine if i do not attempt to apply the gpu delegate before the attempting to load it.
the only difference in the code is the following lines: phofcode
with what i understand about tensorflow 2.0 is that this performance should be the same / similar for this code (see next item for the code).
related to #28628. i am currently not sure how to reproduce a custom build with the same git_version as of nightly.
i will try to reproduce this issue with the next nightly package
the model can be trained regardless of because i used model.train_on_batch().
it should handle learning phase internally.
should work properly with input of type dict.
not hang at the middle of training, the final train log are phofcode
code should run with no error
either tf.cast() gives me a tensor that tells me it 's on the cpu, or else tf.cast() should work correctly.
either the tensor 's .device is wrong, or tf.cast() is wrong.
sub operator should be running on the gpu as per the documentation provided.
the build method should raise some kind of error saying that tensor computation is not allowed in build.
it should also probably be mentioned in the documentation of tf or keras: phofurl phofurl it's sort of suggested but not well enough imo, especially with the hard to find fail it produces
it should load the model correctly even it the restore from the savedmodel is performed inside a distribution strategy context.
the above error does not occur in tf 1.12, perhaps due to `datasetv2` changes with `optimizedataset`.
after some experimentation, i found the error does not occur when `strip_default_attrs` is set to `false` when exporting the savedmodel.
nor does it occur when using example phofhyperlink in a similar capacity.
though the example below is intentionally mundane, i 've found the dataset api functions like `padded_batch` to be extremely nice and was disappointed when i found i couldn 't immediately use 1.13.1 saved models as i had been in previous versions.
cpu and gpu delegate should produce the same masks
i expect `relu` 's input minimum value (for quantization) to match the input tensor 's actual minimum value (a negative real number).
running tfbdg with a filter vs running without a filter produces the same code errors when dealing with catching outofrangeerrors.
convert to tflite without error
results in having the exact same content of src file in the dest file.
`embedding_matrix[2]` should equal to those two equals on tf 1.13.1 version
i suppose the tf_loadlibrary should work and fix the non-registration error.
should be able to run the inference using the gpu delegate on ios with the same model that worked on android
custom loss with multiple input layer works consistent in both distribute and non-distribute env.
there are a couple of questions i have: 1. while i realize that numpy and tensorflow as two completely different libraries, should the disparity in performance be this much?
i am overriding the __init__, build and call functions while making the appropriate super calls as per your article.
am i doing something wrong?
2. do custom layers use the cpu by default?
also tried forcing it by including a with tf.device("/gpu:0") call but that doesn 't seem to help at all.
realize that it might be more efficient to code convolution by adding a custom op but want to avoid that in prototyping stage as much as possible.
i was expecting similar behavior for both and
no error: should return the warped image
the mirror strategy should work well on machine that have more than one gpu otherwise it is useless right?
i found other related issues like: phofurl and phofurl they all reported that the scripts can run for 1 gpu and failed on gpu>=2 any thought is appreciated!
these key properties and methods should in dataset of tf2.0
please revert to the behavior available in
predict results of fitted model with tf.data.dataset using model.predict
i would expect no performance penalty or improved performance for upgrading a library.
this should work the same as when using a lower level implementation with a gradienttape (working fine, no error)
108, 56) should always give an output of 108 by 56
it should be possible to check whether tensorflow is executing eagerly before programs enable eager execution.
this is relevant for forward compatibility with *tensorflow 2.0.0-alpha0* which does not implement enable_eager_execution() but instead reports: attributeerror: 'module ' object has no attribute
the names of the outputs should not change.
this breaks all code that loads the model and relies on the correct names.
the mean squared error metric should always be lesser than the loss, as it is when training the model with custom code instead of using the `fit` method.
as described in tflite document: phofurl `conv_2d` should accept optional bias tensor and does not raise runtimeerror.
i was hoping to find a way to save and restore the state of the random number generator.
sum should not be on the blacklist, and resnet50 should get 709 images/sec.
maybe we can find a way to do the dice loss function sum in fp32, but other sums in fp16?
being able to train keras model in distributed mode.
a result of image classification should be returned.
i would expect nnapi at least not to cause performance degradation.
if i understand correctly, the library is smart enough to choose between gpu and cpu.
there should not be any dimension error during back propagation for the embedding layer when using subclass api, when the same layer works in functional api with same model/inputs.
dtype warning should not be shown.
tf.io.decode_image() and tf.image.resize() should work without any exception in dataset.map().
compile the model without raising any exceptions.
the 60 elements of the output of matmul(x, w) should match exactly the first 60 outputs of matmul(tf.tile(x, [1, 2, 1]), w)
`get_output_details()` returns unique list of outputs.
tf.tuple should support index with tensor in graph mode.
the nadam optimizer will be deterministic.
`tf.while_loop` only loops more than once
lstm computes phases and `shifted_time` for * each * parameter separately (in this case, this would require `shifted_time` and other relevant variables to be the same size as the number of features in the input - e.g.
6 input features implies that `shifted_time` should be a 6-dimensional vector)
according to phofurl this would appear to be the way to log scalar values in tensorboard 2.0. am i incorrect?
if i run the exact same model on a gpu, everything works as expected (eg.
if we uncomment the new `module` class, the output is much more informative.
i think this should be the expected behavior: phofcode
should be able to load regardless of the size of variable
when `tf.keras.layers.lambda` is created without `mask` argument, it does not support masking.
therefore, when a mask is passed, it should raise an exception similarly to what `layer.compute_mask` does ( phofurl
the quantized model should work on nnapi
compute_output_shape should always return correct results
model.build(input_shape) will succeed, and corresponding model variables are created.
memory usage of tf 2.0 should be same or similar to other libraries, not double.
the example could be followed without error.
all workers progress thru the benchmark and finish successfully.
right now it seems a a minimum of one and a max of 4 fail with the error above.
it should reduce lr when val_loss doesn 't improve.
replacing: `optimizer = beta_1=0.9, epsilon=1e-07)` by `optimizer = beta1=0.9)` it works without any issue.
there is so many changes with tf 2.0, that it could be that i am did a wrong implementation but i managed to migrate all old components to keras layer, loss, metrics ... i couldn 't find an equivalent for for tf 2.0 (without using the compatibility module v1)
savedmodel should produce same outputs as the original model.
report the actual error, provide mechanism to catch the exception and handle it.
if using `map_and_batch`, one get changing results like: phofcode there should be always only one and non-duplicate non-zeros per-line.
this was supposed to show a live camera preview
usage of doesn't throw an attributeerror, when being a suggested solution.
the nodes in the with block are executed after the dependant nodes
i expect that an output tensor representing the class of the input handwriting digit is returned from the serving.
somehow sessionrunhook turned into perreplica at some point in evaluation code of estimator.
it should remain sessionrunhook 's interface in distribution mode.
not raises an exception internalerror with type: uint16, 32, 64.
it should be serialized without any error.
i would expect two layers have the same number of variables.
i think it should not use $.numpy() there in the backend, probably(?)
the weights should restore and not run into an error.
and if an error would occur, it should be logged without me having to print it myself.
opt = tf.optimizers.adagrad doesn 't work.
the first 3 methods do.
: it should work without the requirement of external push
different seeds to produce different performance/parameters, specially if the dataset is small or if the optimizer only takes a step for a small batch size.
variable should be converted to eagertensor, operation should return constrained variable.
i would like this code to work without needing to enable persistence mode.
the steps /epochs counters should be restored to allow continuation of training.
if they are not restored, e.g.
tensorboard cannot be used properly, since the new training will write its values to the same steps as the first training, instead of appending them.
the result looks like this: unbenannt phofimage
train_and_evaluate should run evaluation after model save checkpoint
i expect no error when i call tf.summary.scalar() in tf2.0 in both gpu and cpu mode.
(according to tf r1.13) phofcode output: `<dtype: 'float32_ref'>`
should run normally, giving the `[2, 10, 100, 32, 32, 3]` tensor.
derivatives of non-holomorphic functions should becorrect.
expected - have two separate graphs, both initialized by the same checkpoin
i want to predict actions for various input images in reinforcement learning
be able to run the scripts.
i hope the map function can also work in eager mode to ease the coding difficulty.
autograph should works just find even after restoring from a checkpoint.
this looks similar to phofurl
load_weights should work this problem only happens on two+ layers of nested model with non-trainable weights.
the reason is save_weights and load_weights handles nested model differently save_weights -> call layer.weights for each layer load_weights -> recursively call model.weights if layer is a nested model
expectation: the graph can be convert to .tflite file.
should not give any error
the same was working with tf 1.x
i 'm expecting to be able to use the `modelcheckpoint` callback to save the (best) model.
alternatively, i 'm also expecting to be able save the model with the `model.save(filepath)` function.
the model should converge to a much higher accuracy and the moving mean and variance operations should be visible in the update ops.
the order should change for every iteration.
hope all the tensor could be eagertensor in tf2.0
the model will be loaded successfully.
the session should return a scalar float.
it should not be in an ndarray.
workaround: get the actual scalar float in the ndarray if it is not a float phofurl phofcode
expected output shape: output = [?, 64, 64, 8]
the code should convert the string to the bytes, for example: phofcode
i'd expect that assignment to a local variable doesn't change the ability to compute gradients!
this library needs to run and not choke on its own imports.
strided_slice should calculate the shape of the output tensor correctly.
misses to flatten some atrous_convs.
version with gpudelegate is a lot slower ms per run vs ms) than cpu.
the e1102 warning should not be raised.
tf_upgrade_v2 should work in in jupyter and google colab
exact same code working with tensorflow 1.12
i expect it to show the graph for the model.
the code should also execute normally when using `@tf.function`.
`attributeerror: 'sparsetensor ' object has no attribute 'tocoo '`
expected a "typeerror" or an empty list as a result.
expected a "typeerror" or an empty list as a result.
i expect that this should log a warning and halt training.
the expected print should be 0-9 for both `x` and `seed`.
model.save(path) works with a keras model
ideally such a `graph` would not be referenced forever, allowing it to be garbage-collected.
both torch and tensorflow can be imported in any order without gpu issues
finish the 100 epochs of training and save the model *.h5
in the code attached below, i have tested training with and without eager execution, and with and without tf.data.dataset.
here are the training times for one epoch of training on a 4 core cpu: eager + tf.data.dataset : 219s - 22ms/step without eager + tf.data.dataset : 25s - 3ms/step eager + numpy dataset : 26s - 259us/sample without eager + numpy dataset : 26s - 257us/sample
it should be faster than adamoptimizer when sparse update.
i expect custom cells to behave like custom layers: the first time the cell is used, all of its internal layers should be automatically built.
get same inference time with jni on android.
only layer instances should be tracked, not classes.
the output of gpu 1 should be the same as gpu 0.
the value estimate should be a scalar float
if i understood correctly, tf keras is supposed to be interoperable with feature column.
and the way to achieve that is to wrap a list of feature columns with and parse it to the input layer as a tensor like so: `feature_layer = `inputs = name= 'features ')`
i'm expecting the iterator release the memory each time it reinitialized.
`tf.tranpose()` should be fast without the need to resort to reshaping tricks (which will not always apply anyway).
note also that some transposes are implicit (performed, say, by `tf.tensordot()`).
transform should be able to process large number of records.
use specified steps_per_epoch instead of len(data) if specified.
the speed of mobilenet 's inference on snapdragon 845 is expected faster than 100 ms. and how could i know whether the benchmark is built with neon or not?
i expect it to work as expected
seamless conversion to tflite and mlmodel files.
tf.name_scope is applied to wights created by keras.layers output in tf 1.13.1 is the expected behavior phofcode
the exception must be saliently catched: phofcode
i expect the batch norm not to make it so much slower and not to get core dumped with different kernel sizes.
also, i expected fp 16, to be faster than fp 32, (as is in normal conv).
my codebase works correctly on tensroflow r1.12 given the error and my reading of the tensorflow source code throwing the error, my best guess is some op is missing/has a malformed device_spec, or a deivce_spec object is being passed into the function.
the layer that seems to be generating this (see trace below) is phofcode i am using several: and statements to control placement of ops within different towers onto specific devices.
and problematic happening once per tower under a phofcode however, if this error were tied to my mishandling of those control statements many layers of model that get added before would have caused an error.
these issues in past seem somewhat relevant, but they all refer to much older source code for tensorflow, and this a change since r1.12.
so i am not putting much stock in any discussion from these issues: - phofurl - phofurl does anyone have any pointers where i could look for solutions?
my entire codebase will be shifting tf2.0 api once thats out alpha.
however, it my understanding that model data parallel training not fully operational at this time for custom models (non models).
to work as though if it was run without `@tf.function` (e.g.
similar outputs in both cases
would be nice if performance was approximately equivalent.
it should run smoothly as described in the documentation.
should restore model rather than raise error.
2, 3, 4 threads (`-t 2, -t 3, -t 4`) are expected to return the same results as single-thread case.
i would expect c api for `tf_sessionrun` and similar to return an error and caller to have an option to handle the error in some way that does not involve crashing.
the example given in the tf.keras.metrics.meaniou documentation should run without error.
i expect tf 1 `taylor` (which uses `tf.session.run`) and tf 2 `taylor_v2` (which uses `tf.function`) to have similar performance.
the trainable weights before and after saving should be the same, as they are in tf 2.0.0a0.
cache won 't run out of memory
the `apply_gradients_once()` function should work even when annotated with `tf.function`.
i expected flat_map to treat the windows as datasets, allowing me to perform dataset operations such as `batch` on them.
the test should execute normally.
i would like the set-up to work with tensorflow as is with theano that is to share a reference with workers to save memory.
custom ops built with gcc5 should continue working with tf built with gcc4.
the code run perfectly on my jupyter notebook - anaconda server ubuntu 16.04 and also on colab.
my jupyter notebook is 5.7.4 on both windows and ubuntu.
saving and restoring the model should allow to resume training as if there was no interruption in the first place.
subclassing `tf.module` should expose the variables (not to mention training_variables) from all sub-computations, including keras layers, so long as these computations are set as members of the class.
the model should run on phone using nnapi, without any problems.
tf.nn.conv2d with data format nhwc should convergence as expected, it should behave the same as data format nchw or naive dilated convolution implementation.
i want to implement a keras custom layer without any input, just trainable weights.
this kind of layers is very important for visualization (e.g., understanding deep image representations by inverting them phofhyperlink )
being able to write to write to the summary from within the training loop.
tensorboard do the record normally
i expect the behavior from the python file to match the cli behavior.
i am referencing the args on freeze_graph.py phofhyperlink and failing to find an issue with my usage.
the call to `model.fit(x, y)` should fit the model
one of the following: - string arguments are disallowed for a `py_function` running on gpu, and the tf documentation explains this behavior.
- the value of a string argument is accessible in the scenario described above.
no exception, no need to resize the tensor to a 0-dimensional array.
the networks should be trainable individually and in the concatenated version, no matter if we specify metrics or not.
i expect the keras api to be able to train my model as is.
presumably this means that the placeholder tensor should be populated correctly dense_1_target` in
ideally a stacked tensor returned (i was adapting code i developed interactively in eager execution mode, where it worked, in a jupyter notebook for addition to a keras based model), or an error that the argument cannot be a tensor (this is the tf1 behavior): phofcode
when collecting batch-level metrics, epochs should be numbered with the epoch number
the model should be converted with standard cross entropy implementation and without explicitly defined global step variable.
ideally, saving this would work just fine and not crash on the type annotation
this should probably raise an exception.
numpy returns something meaningless in this case, so is not a very good role model!
tensorflow 's svd should be more robust to poorly-conditioned matrices.
the basic code should work.
the tf in the docker container should be updated and build
calling a function decorated with the `@tf.function` should produce the same output as the same function without the decoration.
the model to save its weights properly
the model can be loaded correctly.
there should be a way to statically unroll a loop when using `tf.function` for performance reasons.
in my case, the depth multiplier should be 1 and the size of the input channel dimension should be 6. i'm not sure why it says it is 0?
the `saved_model_main_op` collection and it 's related op should be preserved after conversion.
capturing via an intermediate variable should never change code behavior.
model should be updated with the variable y as a trainable weight
the code runs without a failure.
`decode_predictions` seems to be from here phofhyperlink instead.
the gpu should be used almost if not entirely.
should be trained and logged
what does above error log mean, and is there any way to fix it?
the docker `latest` family should contain tensorflow version 1.13.*.
according to the docs (and docker convention), the `latest` docker images should contain the latest
the updates should be placed on the default graph.
the training should not crash because of the accuracy computation.
no matter the tensorflow version, note that the training does not crash and the accuracy is properly computed when
maybe stream handler is colliding each other.
the iterator / the dataset should be converted in its graph representation.
memory should be freed when the graph leaves scope.
: should fetch the first element of the iterator, thus print 10.
both should be consistent (and accepting a string would provide the simplest api).
any other function that expects a `compression_type` should also respect the same api.
according to this tensorflow 's article on medium phofhyperlink expected at least 3x improvement.
tf.keras.rnn should be equivalent to dynamic_rnn
gradients to be computed correctly
i except to be able to save any tf.keras model (except those with dynamic layers) that uses only standard layers.
should convert frozen pb file to tflite with int8 quantization
the rnn classes in `tf.nn` should be compatible with all keras rnn layers.
i am not sure if this is intended, a bug, or a reasonable failure.
either sparsetensor should be more performant in initialization or should be saveable as a pickle object so i don 't always have to re-initialize it
there should be no error initializing the gpu when using `predict_on_batch`.
on other machines i have used older versions (tf 1.10.0 with cuda 9.0) and it worked fine.
`tf.keras.layers.dense` should be correctly instantiated when defining a model using keras model subclassing api, just like how sequential and functional apis behave.
expected model to be filled
tpu devices can be found on colab when runtime is changed to `tpu` and using: - - `tpu_strategy =
return a ragged tensor regardless of the use of `@tf.function`
`tf_upgrade_v2` does not fails if the file contains f-strings
the depthwise conv2d performance should be same in the official model and the replicated model.
if the calculations were correct.
the score of _precision_ should agree with that of _tf.metrics.precision_.
i would hope that the above 4 issues would be pointed out by the upgrade script as needing my attention, even if it cannot (for some reason, although i imagine the one on line 63 can be done with a string replacement) fix them automatically.
note: i still haven't gotten this script (despite some manual upgrading) to work on tf2, but it (pre-manual upgrade) works fine on tf 1.13.1, although it gives me a bunch a bunch of deprecation warnings :)
i expect `params` in the `model_fn` and `input_fn` to be an instance of hence its parameters should be accessible as attributes.
`params` is a python `dict`.
i expect to be able to use the `tpuestimator` with my own `hparams`.
the example code should work without modifications.
no segmentation-fault when instantiating `calibrator` with the floating-point ssd-mobilenetv1 tf lite model.
`tf.nn.conv2d` should be evaluated, which is done iff the convolution is explicitly placed on the cpu (e.g.
the `build_info` module should also contain information about cuda version among other things.
expected it to import so i could use it.
tf should utilize at least 80%+ gpu in my case since i'm just running inference sessions in parallel in one process, instead of having to resort to limiting ram usage and starting several processes.
i expect `return variable` to return a reference, not a copy of the variable.
for every kernel that is queued on a gpu i expect it to be executed at some point and logged in the timeline
the training parameter should be passed as true when the model is training.
i expect a function to be trace just once for a given set of inputs.
1. the result of running on the gpu of the server should be the same as the result of gpu running on tx2.
there should not be such a big gap.
2. the gpu running result on tx2 should be same as cpu running result on tx2.
i expect the same behavior as in regular python: `i` should be the last value that was run in the `for` loop.
if none of gpus is available, it could just return the empty list, not crushing itself.
i wrote my code for training a model in the way it fully makes use of all the available resources, but i have another code for doing various stuff and i want it to run on cpu when gpu is not available.
i expected get_available_gpus() to return the empty list when none of them is available.
i expect the custom model to be built automatically the first time it is called (e.g., by the `fit()` method).
if in eager mode, the tensors passed to the `call` method of a custom model should be eager tensors.
otherwise, the advantages of eager mode, like the ability to use native control flow, are lost.
according to the documentation provided, model.predict should also be able to take a tensorflow tensor as input.
creating a `mean` instance should be harmless, especially if it is unused.
the code below should run instead of giving an error.
no error is raised if i use one of the following fixes: 1) use 2) remove the `conv2d` layer 3) remove the `batch_size` and `epochs` arguments from the `.fit` call however, context setter seems to have no effect and training is happening on gpu anyways (i can tell by how fast it 's training) behavior seems weird, can anyone explain what 's going on?
if there is no explicit usage of the particular op, it should not be listed in file(.pbtxt
it should not run the code within its "with" block when `global_step % n != 0`, or documentation should be added that describes the current behavior.
it defeats the purpose of it when i can combine an if statement with to produce better results.
expected not to downgrade performance when upgrading tensorflow
the training should be able to run on the gpu of the worker machine
i am trying to parallelize an estimator model built from keras model via which works fine unless i pass the train_distribute parameter (of runconfig) a mirroredstrategy when creating the model.
see below, the working runconfig is commented out, the non-working one not so.
my goal is to run model on google cloud platform on a couple of gpus at once, but first i need to get code running locally.
i want to use mirrored strategy parallelize training by splitting batches across gpus.
the input is a tfrecord file with greyscale images of 40x40x1 and 3-class labels.
am intending use a cnn and rnn on this data but distributed doesn 't work with this simple example of mlp.
using api , the output parameters should be same as ckpt.
the order should be deterministic given the random seed, and there should be a way to reshuffle between epochs.
what i have found is: the second code snippet if 1.5 times faster than the first code snippet with the same training setting.i want to know why this happens and i want know which code snippet is the tensorflow recommended code snippet.
however, when i update my tensorflow version to 1.12.0, the second version(faster) could cause some error("tensorflow graph is invalid, contains a cycle").
dose this mean i have to slow down my multi-gpu quantization-aware training in future version of tensorflow?
only keep_checkpoint_max checkpoints should be saved
these warnings should not be raised.
the function should work in the same way as without the decorator, but it doesn 't.
expected behavior was that model would be built from training operation.
i expect it to work, since the model otherwise works fine, and is saved correctly.
the protobuf version should be consistent.
i expect to be able to define metrics based on any layer 's output, when using the functional api.
i expect no error, `@tf.function` should ensure that `super()` works normally.
gradients can be determined without error.
little to no deprecated warning.
i mean it is deprecated warning should be shown to user when user write their own code using low level tensorflow function.
but the code as simple as above using high level function thrown 3 warnings?
run_metadata should be saved even (especially?)
i'd expect the sgd optimiser to be usable in eager execution mode.
like other layers, conv3dtranspose layer should automatically infer the dimension size as well.
they vary from epoch to epoch.
profile data after optimization: node name | requested bytes | total execution time | accelerator execution time | cpu execution time matmul (100.00%, 88.05%), 1.11sec (100.00%, 46.86%), 0us (0.00%, 0.00%), 1.11sec (100.00%, 46.86%)
i would expect that when method provides only such a delegate, that is capable preparing and running all the ops.
it should return false otherwise, i guess.
is there some way how to tell this in advance, or should i manually check for these kind of internal errors and try to fall back by recreating interpret without gpu support?
because raspberry pi has limited memory.
but as the model is very small it has to run perfectly.
should load normally, and i should be able to continue training where it left off using the loss.
no cpu idle time in prediction.
no parseexample op in inference should be faster.
no leaking `platform/logging.h` and no those warnings about redefining `glog` macros.
convlstm2d works with eager execution
generates random jpeg quality for each image/batch of images passed through it.
a meaningful error message is generated with instructions on why this doesn't work
when we change save_format from `tf` to `h5`, the expection(oserror) should not happen.
expecting it to be faster on gpu
should import properly because it exists in path
the code should run as expected, instead, we get the error message below.
note that changing the flag at the begining of the script makes code work.
get no warning or make sure that this situation would affect result or performance.
i would expect `fit_generator` to work just the same as in the vanilla-keras version or in the normal `fit` version.
my opinion is that the following code: phofcode should return the default value which is 1 and should return phofcode , but for some reason the value is phofcode and the tf.seed changes for next batches of train data, which cause instability of training procedur
the biases should have min/max nodes to be used by tfliteconverter after calling
so the api `function` defines the input should be a list of `placeholders`.
so either someone (maybe @fchollet) need to change the definition in the api so both `placeholder` and `variable` are fine to be valid inputs (looks like they can be compiled fine in both systems).
and make `tensorflow.keras` correct also.
or limit input tensors to be `placeholder`s where some type checks need to done.
by way, i'm not sure this os a specific bug in v1.13.0rc1 and v1.12 or it happens other releases as well since i was using colab.
the _conv3d_transpose_ operation should not see such a sudden drop in performance when increasing input size.
i expected the `training` argument to be set to `true` (or `1`) automatically when i called the `fit()` method.
alternatively, i expected that at least `k.learning_phase()` would return `true` (or `1`), but it 's always `0`.
it should be `1 + 0j` as is returned by `np.complex(0., 0.)
when using tensorflow version 1.12 there isn 't an error: phofcode
operations like addition are commutative.
swapping the position of operands doesn't change the result: - `1e-8 + 1.0 - tf.identity(1.0)` results in `1e-08` - `1.0 - tf.identity(1.0) + 1e-8` results in `1e-08`
expected behavior according to my understanding is that as soon as
the model can be successfully frozen and loaded in cnn, however, failed to work in rnn such as lstm and gru
the estimator should learn the mnist dataset at least as good from the model features as from the raw data.
the program should just work fine without any error.
all the changes i made compared to the normal code were to add the attentioncellwrapper.
the official documentation also has no explanation for the cause of this error.
developers needn't care about which threads are used for calling these apis.
even these apis are called in different threads, interpreter.run() should return correctly with blocking issue.
the worker should run normally.
the classes in `tf.rnn` should be compatible with cells defined in `tf.keras.layers`.
that the topkv2 op functions as specified, or that the `top_kv2` python binding is exposed.
behaviour should be the same for lists or tuples.
fix is easy: if isinstance(output_shape, (list, tuple, np.ndarray)):
i expect tensorflow to find that my gpu (or at least my cpu) is a valid device to execute a batchnorm operation on.
and what i 'm expecting to see is phofcode here i 've chosen a shard with a test that passes on my machine but you can hopefully see the difference.
the tflite converter converts the tf.keras model to tflite model.
there are couple of issues with the existing behavior -: a) ideally one should not be required to change the code in the callbacks.
but that is an ideal situation; it is understandable to some extent that in cases such as mirroredstrategy a custom callback may require extra conditions.
b) however, what is strange or rather would be considered ill advised is the warning generated by tensorflow i.e.
"you can access each of individual distributed models using `_grouped_model` attribute of your original model" the warning seems to suggest that one should try to access an `undocumented` and `private` property of an object.
also there no `_grouped_model` attribute on self.model anyways; one that i see `_original_model` that said, expected behavior document if a custom callback be designed considering some caveats when using mirroredstrategy and provide a public attribute and/or method have access original model.
i generated them with fan_in = 100, fan_out = 100 and ploted their histogram.
i printed out the smallest and largest from the sampe and i got these should be 2!
model loading is fine and runs perfectly for 15-20 min and after that, it throws phofcode error and exits.
the compiled version prediction of a single image should be as fast as a non-compiled prediction.
i suspect the compiled graph uses cpu for the inference.
i expect to be able to use the tensorboard callback without issues.
i expect it to be quicker with optimized graph.
should load the graph without an exception.
i would expect both version to be equally fast, or the newer version to be faster.
in any case i would not expect the creation of the graph to slow down at each extra added layer.
also i cannot understand while sharing variables should be slower than instantiating from initializer with constant tensor...
type in the code below and see no memory usage increases.
should not be trying to access gcp metadata endpoint.
tflite outputs is expected to match tensorflow outputs
phofcode should create iterator object.
according to definition of hann window phofurl phofhyperlink , which should be: `(*window)[i] = 0.5 - 0.5 * cos((2 * pi * i) / (window_length - 1));` please correct me if i missed anything
the graph is expected to load and run successfully.
np.array(x) should run in a reasonable amount of time.
doing a simple list comprehension with tensor.numpy() shouldn 't be faster.
i would like to pass my flattened data into either a dense or an rnn layer.
i think the problem is related to the magic behind tf.function.
the issue is that there isn 't a complete guide on how to use correctly tf.function.
since the shape of `x` is known at compile time, the constant folder should be able to fold away these ops to create a single const for the new shape for reshape.
expected behavior is that the debugger does not crash and i can examine the tensors.
this seems to happen on the gpu version i've tested on another system, but crashes on the cpu version on my mac.
whether previous function call raised assertion error or not, function result should be independent of previous function call
gradienttape.gradient() returns gradients for every variable in the var_list, same as tf.gradient()
the train metric should be on train data only and validation metric (*_val) should be on validation data only.
should not affect the behavior and the code should run in both cases.
a tensorflow lite version of the frozen model file should have been generated by the tool.
a model created with can be loaded by using "./model")
not encountering any errors as per the "effective tensorflow 2.0 guide" phofhyperlink
i would expect at least 10x better performance on fake data generation.
the same code was runing with tf 1.12 and i could train the model using estimator
i used the tf 2.0 conversion script to convert my dcgan sample from tf1.x to tf2.0.
it suggested use of (previously in contrib), but am unclear if this has same behavior as the script did not recommend a replacement for
i would expect that `model.fit()` restarts from the beginning in the validation dataset after every epoch of training.
this way the validation dataset could be used without `.repeat()` and the evaluation would be performed on same set of examples.
perhaps the documentation just needs to be fixed to add a `call()` method and an explicit `signature` argument, but it would be nicer if it could work without having to do that.
i expect the `method_name` to be equal to
- the mnist images are well classified.
i expected that should be able to load a model created witih keras.
we hope the engine_map in trtengineop can maintain a pair, which the first value can be tensorrt engine.
the sescond value can be a tensorrt context pool.
i would expect that tf.eval() gives me a numpy float/array and therefore the ouput after multiplying with my first layer should result in something like tensor("add_12:0", shape=(1, 16), dtype=float32).
why does the numpy array/float "remember its origin"?
i would have expected that the .tflite version works because the .pb version of the same ssd_model works well!
the program should print some logging information in autograph conversion e.g.
phofcode should works without showing unsupported type
it should be able to import tensorflow.
i don 't have problem in anaconda.
translate test function return same results but on training model, i got phofcode on restored model, i got phofcode looks almost random.
how can i save and load weight of tf.keras custom model properly?
or does nightly solve the problem?
expect fit() time to remain constant even with multiple re-compiles
should always do weight decay, regardless of how variables are created.
the same model starts training in a couple of minutes without distribute strategy when using much simpler model, like resnet50 mirrored strategy also lags at startup compared to single gpu, but nevertheless training starts in a couple of minutes.
what may be the problem with mirrored strategy?
specifically, when calling the fit method with a `validation_split` parameter, a proportion of the samples equal to (count of samples) * (validation_split) should be removed from the training data.
batch normalization ops should have been folded into weights and biases of previous layers in the tflite graph in order to optimize inference latency.
the program should run successfully.
because only the chief does the checkpoint, i think the chief must wait others finishing, otherwise the model is partially trained and evaluator will not stop.
expect the load to be shared by all the available cores and the performance to scale up with increasing number of cores.
i believe softmax outcome should be different in each run.
it doesn 't happen when i use which is to be removed in future version.
no error; the iterator produces a single batch.
since tf.keras using tf as backend operation, weights updates and gradient calculation should be identical.
memory usage on the same order as it 's on disc usage.
the example should run as is.
a .tflite file is converted.
we expect to get the same results when we use v1 or v2.
we know that you guys are working on v2 of the while loops, and we're really excited for it.
we just wanted to make certain this was on your radar as a use case, since we didn't see it in the rfc
i just compiled the new master branch, and it was working before.
expected behavior is that the nnapi time should be much shorter than cpu
the error should not be raised because there is no loop in the computation graph.
the code should run successfully.
smaller size of output graph
phofcode output phofcode indeed, i think only variable scope will add a prefix to the variable name, but not name scope.
all the following functions should return almost identical graphs.
expecting arm6 build of `libtensorflow.so` and to work the same as arm7 build.
i expect to return the same concrete function whether i pass it 1, or 2, or tf.constant(3) or tf.constant(4) as an argument.
i expect a different concrete function to be returned when i pass it [1.0], but this second concrete function should be the same as for the arguments [2.0], or tf.constant([3.0]), tf.constant([4.0]) np.array([5.0]), np.array([6.0])
when i study the source code in i think it should returns [[[0.
i expected a valid flatbuffermodel to be returned.
in the original notebook example, it prints out evaluation loss without error
according to the guide phofhyperlink , "restoring a model 's state from a checkpoint only works if the model and checkpoint are compatible" and it is given an example of how the described situation (changes in the model architecture) should generate an `invalidargumenterror`.
however no error is raised, being unclear behavior - are new weights (in case of increased size) initialised and trained?
i expect to be able to iterate over the rows of a `raggedtensor` without any error.
1. why the size of the apk file is increased when i use the quantized model ?
2. how to reduce the apk size built with tflite model ?
runs and detects objects smoothly
the expected behavior are 1. training process gets slower by at most two-fold using this implementation 2. does not further slow down after every epoch 3. no error thrown.
the log function is fundamental and used all the time, it should be available in `tf.log()` (and also in `tf.math.log()`.
especially considering that `tf.exp()` is available.
note that many code examples still show `tf.log()` (try searching for ` 'tf.log( '` in the code base, you will find 12 matches across 8 files).
the fakequant op should be added after the clip op
i expect `model_to_dot()` to be available in or at least in `tf.keras.utils`.
run tensorflow well in both files.
i expect the `tensorboard` callback to gracefully handle these issues, perhaps display a warning, but do not force a recompile or a kernel restart.
i expect the same nice output as in previous versions, such as `input_1[0][0]`, `dense_3[0][0]` or `concatenate[0][0]`.
i expect it to save a png image of the model.
with partitioner dividing embedding matrix to each ps, the training process should also converge quickly.
i expect the progress bar to go up to 100% and display a newline.
ideally this would just work?
unless i 'm missing something
i expect no error, and the kernel should be initialized to zeros, just like when i set
would expect the program to finish without a warning.
if the tutorial was correct, the code should run without any bugs and the evaluation results should be the same after loading.
regarding the code snippet above, we need `inputs` to be a list rather than a single operand and `.addinput()` should be `.addinputlist()`.
the expected result is `a_sqrt_2`.
ideally it should work (after all there's 128gib of hbm on the other side of this pipe so 2gib is really not unreasonable here), worst case i'd have expected an error status to be returned rather than a hard assert.
variables copied using should have the same shape of original variables in order to make possible restoring from a checkpoint.
no nan in the output.
similar value when running same op multiple times.
i expect behavior not to differ from when providing arrays or lists of arrays as input.
i should be able to provide a `tf.data.dataset` as input, that provides a single tensor or a list of tensors.
after restoring the input checkpoint, the train restart at the right dataset iterator step.
1. isn 't it an online algorithm?
it seems that the memory consumption of the tensorforest is relatively large?
2. the original paper said that, in large dataset (like higgs, 11m examples, 28 features), tensorforest with 100 trees and 10k nodes per tree trains in about
running example app with retrained model as shown in the guide phofhyperlink
the expected behavior is run the code and get the result of the estimation through of the `output `tensor.
run a convolutional neural network with no error messages
the result should the the sum of the elements on the diagonal (compare with `np.einsum('ii', matrix)`)
the one-hot columns in the dataset should not be normalized.
should copy the part of the graph containing the fold operation.
maybe it can manage in a particular way recursive blocks like fold.
the api should run without error.
it shouldn't print control characters
i should be able to pass a variable size image to the model.
the model (*pb file) works fine in ubuntu.
in >=1.11, the training step is evaluated once (correctly).
however, 1.11 is not supported in gcloud ml-engine.
should work as it does on gpu and cpu backends
as per the `keras` api and current documentation, the two properties should fail with an `attributeerror`.
in addition, those two properties should fail if tensorflow is executing eagerly
model.predict() will return the correct predicted value for the given data.
all outputs should be the same my model looks like this: phofcode if i run the exact same thing with `def y_pred): return k.mean(k.square(y_pred - y_true))` and loss=my_loss, and batch_size=256)))` it works fine.
so it seems, that there is something wrong with k.sqrt(
memory used by these methods should be released when done.
current default limits for protobuf messages loaded by a codedinputstream are 2gib so my model should load without error.
the expected behavior should be zero regardless if running on cpu or gpu, because windows at these locations contain only zero entries.
because the only non-zero entry is outside the window used to compute the value, then this is most likely a buffer overflow (or some other memory access issue).
running on gpu should be much faster than on cpu
importing tensorflow should not influence the behavior of other toolkits.
i 'm getting an error while training.
`estimator.train` should succeed with multiple gpus and multiple applications of a keras layer.
specifying no index means that i am accessing a list of tensors, where as specifying an index gives me the tensor at that index.
it should start training, or more probably throw some other error honestly, everything related to tpus on colab is in aplha, so i was kinda expecting bugs after bugs and so it happened, nothing personal this is the final bug i got stuck on
profiling works for both machines.
i would expect the normalization ops to be folding into the weights, so that only one const/read node remains.
tensorflow should refuse to perform a sparse-dense multiplication that requires broadcasting.
this is the case when both tensors have the same rank or the rank of the sparse tensor is less than rank of dense tensor, but not when rank of sparse tensor is greater.
the expected behavior is that the `tf.graph()` instance used by an invocation of `train()` is garbage collected by the python gc after `train()` terminates.
i 've observed this expected behavior when using and
i would expect a secondary algorithm that does not require any workspace to kick in should the scratch allocation for the primary algorithm fail even when i am not using autotune.
given that it is possible to convert tensorflow models such as inception to tensorrt as evidenced by phofurl the conversion should similarly work for models in
resnet50 inference accuracy should look something close to (top1, top5) = (0.7315, 0.9109).
normal behavior as expected from the `train_and_evaluate` function
variables of inner `tf.keras.dense` layers should have different names, such as: `dense/kernel:0` `dense/bias:0` `dense_1/kernel:0` `dense_1/bias:0` right now they have the same name: `kernel:0` `bias:0` `kernel:0` `bias:0` this is problematic for saving / loading parameters.
why isn 't it working?
the binary that used the .so works without segfault whether or not the .so is compiled in debug mode or not.
with same command, can get the right result and plot the bounding box.
the performance should be similar.
hi i 'm trying to detect more than 10 objects in the image ( which is default ) i 'm usin the following commands: bazel run -c opt -- --inference_type=float --max_detections=500 --allow_custom_ops i also modified 500 <--- instead of 10, 'maximum number of detections (boxes) to show. ')
1, 'number of classes to display per detection box. ')
but still giving 10 objects as output in the android [1,10,4].
it should run out of memory in the first epoch or never.
but the upsampling2d is much faster input1 = x_a = input1 for i in range(6): x_a = tf.keras.layers.conv2d(8 * (2
in the example below the first instance of tensorflow in the virtualenv should have been able to see the gpu.
i think converter should be support scalar shape placeholder, because tf users usually need scalar shape placeholder when they set dynamic params (hyper params, dropout, ect...) in neural network.
name="flatten")` should allow access to flatten operation from the exported graph using name `flatten` and should not require naming it separately.
work normally with bazel -c dbg and bazel -c opt.
memory consumption should be bounded for any number of iterations.
performance should improve, or at least remain the same, on p3.16 as compared to p3.8, as there are more cpus available.
i would have expected the output to be same in eager mode as well, just like in graph mode.
ideally, a dynamic_rnn should support tf.in32 types.
if there's any reason why instantiating a dynamic_rnn with tf.int32 type in its input and state should not be allowed, a custom error should be raised.
when i 'm using keras layers to define the models and i 'm not calling `train_on_batch` or `compile` or any other method to train the model that 's pure keras, the update operations should be placed into the graph (having thus same behavior of batch normalization layer present in `tf.layers`) and executed when model `.trainable` is `true`.
moreover, there 's another strange behavour: when i define a model output passing a new input (hence i invoke `model.call` method) update operation have no idea of this new input.
probably, `.call` method shouln 't just return output tensor, but it should return a new `model` that shared same parameters of orignial one, but defined with a new input (and thus with its update ops aware of input).
the test program should complete normally.
i don 't think my program has a bug that is responsible for the exception but even if it does, the throwing of the exception should be consistent and not depend on `episode_length` being big enough.
the call to `tf_graphimportgraphdef` must succeed.
there should not be an performance decrease in this drastic
well, the expected behavior is that generates correct result.
two different runs should always have the same output.
i expect the data api to allow me exploring data in eager execution mode even if i use the csvdataset class.
i can 't use `textlinedataset` as my csv file contain multi line values in quotation marks.
the path to cuda should be dynamically obtained (by configuration or environment variables).
the expected behavior would be the model compiling and fitting as it does with the `model(model.input)` line uncommented.
the example below would also work when defining the `y_pred_zeros = model(tf.zeros((32, 20)))` outside of the `loss` function.
but for adversarial training, i need to call model inside of loss function.
if i increase the weighting by a certain factor, the overall loss of the model should increase by the same factor.
given model is doing random guessing.
i deployed those models to my phone.
i get runtime of around 290 ms for the unconverted model, while having runtimes of about 420 ms for the quantized tflite, the optimized and quantized tflite and the plain tflite model.
that can 't be right, can it?
it should have saved three .ckpt files namely: -checkpoint -checkpoint.ckpt-00.data -checkpoint.ckpt-00.meta
if i were using normal keras, i 'd expect no errors trying to do the above and for the model to compile subsequently without issue.
want the `generate_np` method of the saliencymapmethod object to return an adversarial example for the wrapped keras model.
in tf 1.8 the import library is present, but not in tf 1.12. this library is required to build custom operators.
tf.load_op_library is working correctly with tensorflow 1.8 on my configuration.
the same custom operators rebuilt for tf 1.12 are not found by tf.load_op_library, although the paths of the dll given to tf.load_op_library are correct.
both ops should appear in the loaded module.
no error and able to get checkpoint path.
all layers should be correctly created
should work like with tf 1.11.0
scatter_max can work with mirroredstrategy in tensorflow-gpu 1.10.0
i think it will just keep going like this unless i fix the problem......
there are a different blog post and resources on how to perform backpropagation for batch norm.
centering the data is a key part of any norm, and it seems like auto differentiation is getting the value wrong?
or am i just going crazy.
i thought the gradient respect to the input variable should be 1 - 1/(10 * 94 * 94) - since 10 is dim - 94 is dim 1 and 2.
it should support multiple inputs models.
if instead of i run it with `output_shape` argument: `random_transformations = images = random_transformations, 'nearest ', dtype=np.int32))` everything goes as expected.
so i guess that the issue in on passing output_shape=none in line of def translate(images, translations, interpolation="nearest", name=none): """translate image(s) by the passed vectors(s).
args: images: a tensor of shape (num_images, num_rows, num_columns, num_channels) (nhwc), (num_rows, num_columns, num_channels) (hwc), or (num_rows, num_columns) (hw).
the rank must be statically known (the shape is not `tensorshape(none)`.
translations: a vector representing [dx, dy] or (if images has rank 4) a matrix of length num_images, with a [dx, dy] vector for each image in the batch.
name: the name the op.
returns: image(s) with same type and shape as `images`, translated by given vector(s).
empty space due to translation will be filled with zeros.
raises: typeerror: if `image` is an invalid type. """
ops.name_scope(name, "translate"): return transform( images, ``
datasetb is expected to correspond to the order of shuffled dataset a.
expected: trainable variables are updated by optimizer, but untrainable variables are not.
it should complete the training of the model.
it has not yet been set up to save it.
since tf follows bsp (it does not support ssp, right?
), these workers should be always under the same iteration.
when slow worker still stays in iteration 1, the other workers cannot go to iteration 3 or further.
in fact z1 and z2 should be the same, hope there is some method to optimize z1, since in my program, there are many similar situation.
consider order of tensor contract is too complicate
ideally all of these would work.
if that takes longer to do, at least exposing the error message to the client, rather than crashing would be desired.
the same training procedure should yield exactly same result using only 1 worker with/without 1 ps.
not sure why adding sendrecvops causes data corruption.
i want to change the input tensor size freely
tensor should be reshaped internally and crash should 't occur.
i would like it not to crash.
the expected behavior is after toco, the .tflite still has one conv2d layer and one fully connected layer.
it should not fail to create a concat primitive descriptor
the global steps should be 1625 but it 's 1. the acc and loss shouldn 't be equal to 0 as both of them are contradicting each other.
i tried to export the resulting .pb file to tflite via this command in the terminal: `tflite_convert --output_arrays=output `
the matrix multiplication should complete successfully.
i should see logging on ml engine that indicates validation accuracy for each epoch, like this: epoch 2/2000 1/200 - eta: 2:00 - loss: 5.7345 - acc: 2/200... when i set `steps_per_epoch` to be only 200, i * do * see validation accuracy logging as expected.
for what it 's worth, the training still works and produces .h5 files.
but it 's crucial that i be able to view logging as the model 's training.
spoke with folks on the ml engine team and it 's not an issue on their end.
they suspect it 's a bug with the callback or me misusing `steps_per_epoch` somehow.
is there a certain value shouldn 't exceed with `steps_per_epoch`?
wanted to do one full pass over data, so that should be: # samples / (steps_per_epoch * batch_size), which would be ~1,593 steps.
even 1,000 steps_per_epoch causes this issue though.
every epoch should roughly take the same time
we expect the two graph to output similiarly (normally, we get absolute error < 1e-5)
when is specified, cuda contexts should only be created on the devices listed.
there should be a way to disable mkl primitive memory reuse globally with an environment variable be it or better yet something else.
primitive memory reuse does not play nice with unknown tensor sizes as most of the time there are no cache hits and allocated memory is simply piled up in the cache.
the static graph version and the eager version should have the same behavior.
flops should be linear in batch dimension
it should run, as it did before.
replacing mirroredstrategy by parameterserverstrategy launches a training with cpu acting as ps and 2 gpu workers.
the matmul function should return correct results, regardless of sparsity or data type.
the betainc_op test should pass, where none of the values are nan
i would expect that two models trained to similar accuracy on the same architecture should both quantize reasonably well, despite the number of prediction target classes in the fully-connected layers.
we expected the code to run through all data parts without issues.
to not throw the error as was the case for tensorflow 1.8.
it should simply update the variable and should output the following in a deterministic manner: [array([19., 19., 19., 19., 19., 19.
], dtype=float32), 6] i suppose this is a bug in the caching process involved if the code is run on a gpu.
`tf.nn.conv2d_transpose` with the same inputs is expected to produce the same outputs on different calls on gpu.
gradients should be correct and there should be no difference in gradients whether a placeholder or another variable is used.
the expected behavior is that i should be able to change the learning rate of my optimizer after a batch ends or after an epoch ends
`cumsum` should be as accurate as the `float32` precision.
i would have expected that autotune could pause and not "start from scratch" (and would stay running quickly) so long as i kept the session object around.
code should work with eager execution mode.
i want to use toco to transform the pb file to the tflite file
performance should actually improve with intel mkl instruction set .
gpu memory should be at most parameters+activations
when i generate the profile file by using the low level approach of runoptions, runmetadata, and then writing the string generated by i can load it with tfprof and analyze it just fine.
this should happen even when using profilecontext.
trainig should start and use the available 4 gpus
should not produce this error.
expected behavior is no segfault.
version 1.10.1, 1.10.0, and 1.9.0 do not segfault.
i have not checked lower versions.
variable is expected to be iterable, just as eagertensor, but right now it raises typeerrors
the metric should be calculated successfully in both distributed and non-distributed evaluations.
the program should finish with no error.
ideally there should be no error, as it is a model which works fine in keras (tf backend)
it should be able to handle larger tensors and batch sizes.
requires information about why the above error is getting displayed for some of bmp images.
multi gpu training of "predrnn" keras model using works without any warning related ops compatibility with devices.
all cpu core 's usage is below 30% and gpus usage are around 100% equally for all gpus while training.
input names in graph definition and timeline label in metadata have the same names

horizontal scrollbar working on console window copy very long text to clipboard, and working drag.
popup window should have sign placed
all the instances of `class` are highlighted as keywords, with the 2nd one highlighted as 'selected ' using `pmenusel`
`[on]` is displayed in the status line, and the cursor stays where it is in the buffer.
`expand("%:p")` should complete in less than one millisecond.
the output of `synid()` is always the id of the syntax group `helpbar`; not sometimes the id of `helpbar`, and sometimes the id of `helpexample`.
nothing is selected when on the first ` '` and on the `b`.
when on `a`, only `ba` is selected (the `r` is missed).
disabling the toolbar should not result in such a huge start up delay.
no error regardless of the terminal column size.
the status line in the right window displays `not active`, because: - for the window to exist, vim had to focus it at least temporarily - it is not focused anymore, therefore it was left - when it was left, `winleave` was triggered - when `winleave` was triggered, the autocmd `au bufwinleave,winleave * setl stl=not active` run when the autocmd run, value of ` 'statusline '` option c local to window c set to `not active`
the text selection should continue to the end of the line.
all `c` files are selected
i expect the value of `lispwords` to be `hello`, or at least to contain `hello`.
the statusline should not flicker while scrolling.
`popup_create()` should also accept buffer-local text property types.
`redraw` does not affect the behavior.
the cursor jumps onto the last character, `z`.
i don't know if it is by design, but it doesnot look so reasonable.
windows 10 is shipped with a `scp` by default, and this version of scp is ready to parse the standard windows file path format.
according to the source of netrw (netrw.vim: 2220 phofhyperlink ), which eventually change the windows format path to unix-like form just before the execution of scp command.
this doesn 't make any sense actually, because modification at (netrw.vim: 2220 phofhyperlink ) masks previous careful work on modifying file path by testing whether user is in cygwin mode or not (netrw.vim: 11518 phofhyperlink ).
the motion should only bring the cursor onto the `{` on lines 1, 3, and 6 as start of class, start of method, end of class, respectively.
instead, it _also_ will land on the `{` on line 2, which is a java annotation and should not be reached by the `]m` and `[m` motions.
two tabs in the tab line: b and c
the 2nd word of line 1 should have remained blue, and had italics applied on top.
since the line entered in step 2 above is longer than 80 characters and ` 'formatoptions '` contains the `l` flag, the line should not be reformatted.
"bar" and some text to the left of it get selected
the text inside the quotes gets selected
after step 2, the letter `c` should be in the buffer and insert mode should still be active.
one of the debug tips from `:help modifyotherkeys` is to enter insert mode, press <kbd>ctrl+v</kbd> and then the key sequence that's problematic.
however, this isn't working with `'noesckeys'` either.
obviously the expected behavior is for all the files to be saved.
this is indeed what happens if you do as above, but using `ctrl+w+s` and `ctrl+w+v` for horizontal and vertical splits, and then open the files using `:e [file]`
i expected the cursor to not move in either case.
<c-u>")` should work just like the other scrolling keys.
- it would be nice if vim provided some scrolling functions that could be used in a popup-filter.
when `minwidth` and `maxwidth` are set to the same value, i would have expected the popup window to keep that value at all times.
`call prop_clear(1)`, text properties is removed.
the color should be the same as background of popup window.
there should be a way to copy-paste text from vim to an x11 application.
a way to achieve this would be to disable `mouse_xterm` by default when `clipboard` is disabled.
if a warn or msg could reminder the user - the remote saving failure - would be great.
terminating a command with `job_stop()` should always result in a non-zero exit code.
second line should be indented, but it isnt.
each time i hit ctrl-p i should see the full text of the potential entry to complete and insert.
should return the screen position per the test above.
the bottom window is squashed to `0` lines.
the window is `26` lines high, because of the autocmd running `wincmd _` on `winenter`.
* the lines starting with `.sh` should not be considered as blank lines.
* the `{` and `}` operators should jump only to lines 3, 7 and 11.
* placing the cursor at line 4 and using the `ip` operator should select the lines 4, 5 and 6.
* placing the cursor at line 8 using `ip` operator should select lines 8, 9 10.
i would have expected `expandcmd( '~/foo ~/bar ')` to expand the `~` anywhere in the string, just like `%`.
cursorline should not be displayed other than the popup window
should not have the gap
documentation suggests that `a:added` should reflect the total number of lines added.
external command should keep current directory, as in linux do.
`:cdo` aborts on a failure and stops traversing the list.
i expect vim to exit cleanly.
`argc` and `argv` should not be highlighted as cmacroname.
the screen is restored without colors changing.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
like in `vim i expect that only background color will be changed, but foreground color is should stay the same.
there should be no error.
vim stops scrolling the pum immediately.
the preceding tab character is not highlighted.
the match should be included in the resulting highlight: to reproduce for `v_gn`, search `5` and highlight `34567` from right to left, then `gn`.
the resulting highlighted region is `67` but `567` is the correct behavior.
the version without patch works as expected.
i tested on (the direct parent of this patch).
it outputs the mapping only once: c <c-a> * xxx
vim outputs `['not from heredoc']`.
the first command raises no errors, and outputs: [' x'] the second command raises no errors, and outputs: ['xx', ' x', 'xx']
when i press i in the list of files, the file details appear, the list stays in place, in the same order
the buffer content is updated.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
`vim.eval` shouldn 't change the value of dictionaries it evaluates.
no cursor line should be displayed if `cursorline` is off.
don 't introduce extra blank line.
the `:help expr-!~?` command should work right after vim start (step 2).
the cursor should end up on the 'e ' character right after after the search in step 4.
the file `a.txt` is folded in the top window, just like it is folded in the bottom window, because: - `a.txt` is already displayed in the bottom window - `a.txt` is folded in the latter - when editing a buffer that has been edited before, options from window that was last closed are used again (see `:h local-options`) - closing window not a requirement anymore since phofurl ; i.e.
vim can now copy window-local options from another window where same buffer currently displayed if such a exists
for the command line window to be closed by the autocmd.
i would expect that in the right window: - the ` 'list '` option is set to `1` - the end of lines are displayed with a dollar character - the tab characters are displayed with `i` because, according to `:h local-options`, vim should have remembered that `x` buffer was displayed in left window, and in that window ` 'list '` option is set to `1`.
which is what happens when i run this similar shell command: $ vim -nu none + 'sil ", 3)|setl list|bo vnew|b x ' x
the text line of the cursor in the left window is highlighted by `cursorline` immediately, without having to interactively focus the window once.
i would expect the last `gk` to move the cursor on the previous screen line.
the issue persists even after opening all folds with `zr`.
i expect the highlighting in the popup to be the same as the highlighting in a normal window.
written on `:h completion-function` too.
expect the content pasted ok/there.
pressing `<c-j>` while on a directory in the wild menu should "open" that directory and restart wild mode completion.
a list of omni complete suggestions should have appeared.
the `{cmd}` is executed in the configured shell.
there should not be such a paradox.
if it is local to window, the behavior should not be local to buffer.
if it is local to buffer, the doc should be updated and `py should be the correct usage, `py not.
the status line should show "/tmp/
the `quickfixline` highlighting starts from the beginning of the line, which here displays `/tmp/file|1 col 1|`.
since the `nontext` highlight group usually does not have a `termbg` or `guibg` specified, the 'showbreak ' character should use the popup window background colour.
expected editor not to crash.
a new split buffer is opened with a git-bash terminal window that can execute commands such as ls, grep,...
it is expected that item b is highligted in step 5.
the word `in` should be moved to the 4th column.
the info popup to be coloured the same as the completion candidates popup.
the sorting order should change without corrupting the file listing.
no sigabrt happens, echoes `{ 'x ': { 'y ': 2}}`.
to be able to send keys/commands to the popup window without them being intercepted by the filter menu.
no error, since 128k is not large memory consumption, and other text editor, say, sublime text, has no problem with it.
it should be possible to use to scroll the popup buffer, just as you can when the buffer does not contain signs.
the `x` character is inserted in the buffer.
only the first line is highlighted with cursorline.
the preview popup is cleared in the left-hand window.
both options `popup_filter_menu()` and `#{close: 'button '}` should work together.
the system buffer should not be lost when the application is put in background (or closed).
the tag selection menu should appear, showing one tag (the function from `test.sh`).
this only works when `wildignore` does not contain the folder.
intuitively, `wildignore` should not affect whether or not vim uses the files defined in `tags`.
i would expect no error, the cursor to stay on the first occurrence of `test`, and the search register to contain ` <test >`.
the first line of the fold was originally: fu!
func() {{{1 after pressing `zd`, i would expect: fu!
func() but in fact, i get: fu!
`func()` has been wrongly removed.
cpu usage shouldn't noticeably change when a mouse click is made.
that the quoted text ` 's '` is highlighted as a string and the remainder of the line is highlighted correctly.
i expect it to use the work the same as any other window and go down with `<c-w>k`.
the terminal in normal mode works as expected
at step 8. above, i expected the text properties to be retained for the buffer, after navigating away and back again.
if `set hidden` is used, the text properties are retained.
at step 11., something has clearly gone wrong - the contents of buffer are missing.
i think both windows and macos should echo `4`, which mean `term_getline` should contain the last several spaces.
filetype indenting should not slow down redraws so much.
in 8.0, jumping to the middle of a large file is still slower with `filetype indent on`, but not so slow it exceeds redrawtime.
(and it does not, if `--cmd "set spell"` is omitted, or if the last word of the file is deleted.)
according to the documentation, the bookmark phofcode is expected to point to
allow the user to use the `normal` highlighting group for popup windows.
when pressing `q` or `a` after the attention message `e325`, vim should not open the popup window.
or at least it should be possible to close the empty popup window with `<c-w>z` or using the mouse.
title of preview popup window should be truncated (at the beginning?
), similar to the file name in the `statusline`.
vim gives up that undo file and continue.
filereadable() should return _true_ for path relative to the users home directory.
not any character in the new file
the first line of the buffer should be immediately visible.
after quitting the just now created tab, the bottom of the maximized upper window moves one line upward, i.e.
its size changes one line.
vim should open the url in a web browser.
always clear the highlighting without needing to run `:redraw!` or `<c-l>` afterwards, even when the focus is on another window.
cursorline should highlight either the entire row (just like insert-mode completion 's popup menu), or the current item only.
ideally, it would be nice if the `cursorline` option could be extended so that users can select the highlighting behavior.
the width of the dialog window should not be drawn wider than the text displayed inside it.
just the numbering is changed in steps 3 and 4. the text should not be redrawn.
no error messages thrown since the job output is correct.
all commits should be pushed to a repo.
a user should be able to decide what format options they want by editing it in their vimrc.
there should be an option to disable the automatic update of `formatoptions`.
the gitignore rule would ignore unix hidden files only: anything that
to find only the correct character.
add one single shiftwidth on newline, independently from the tag.
all changes to reflect the correct line contents.
the `lcd` should not print messages during an autocmd when `silent!` prefixes it.
the contents not to be clipped.
a border of the popup shows without the breaks.
only the `word-test` suggestion should be proposed, i.e.
actually completed instantly (because of only single match)
the file `file.pyc` should be openend.
expected result: "statuslinetermnc xxx term=reverse ctermfg=0 ctermbg=2 guifg=bg guibg=lightgreen"
i expect it to start/be responsive.
the following values should be updated for the now hidden buffer: - `'hidden'` should be `1` - `'windows'` should be an empty list
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
very fast to jump to definition
start from vertical column 4.
(since first character is tab: tabstop=4)
the existing quick fix menu is made current.
i would expect the `./tags` buffer to be focused the first time i run `:argedit tags`.
expected not to see `-lcanberra` since the sound feature is disabled (-sound).
i believe it 's only supposed to be in big and huge builds.
because the file a is write protected, `rm` prompts `rm: remove write-protected regular empty file 'a'?` in the command line, while it didn't trigger the `on_stdout` with this prompt.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
the fact that an exception is underway should not influence the parsing result of (valid) vimscript.
code that is supposed to be skipped during exception handling should not generate errors.
show popup windows at the right top and disappear after 5s
the generated `.desktop` files in `runtime/` pass `desktop-file-validate`, and this is verified when they are generated and committed
a value == `virtcol("$") - 1` i guess?
the calculation order of `json_encode()` should be faster than o(n2).
appearance of selection should not be there
the cursor should go to the line containing the text "ab*cd".
instead, it returns an `e486: pattern not found: ab*cd`, which is an error i would expect if `magic` was turned on.
i 'd like cusor keeping it 's space after running
not to receive multiple concurrent callbacks for the same change, unless i 've massively misunderstood something.
osc-52 escape codes from `:terminal` should be propagated to the terminal vim is running in.
i can reproduce this on both macos and linux
it should display last or next shell cmd when press up&down key on shell
it shows `test...` and after one second `test...done`.
a new line appears in the buffer consisting of the word `hello`
there should be no prompt, since there is plenty of space to fit the [2/2] numbers.
normally it should just cut the 'whatever' - without the end '#'
it should be possible to determine the version of `gvim` without requiring a tty.
file isn 't saved because of the conversion error
a message should be displayed.
vim should quit immediately and not eat keypresses that were not intended for vim.
i would expect the output of `:echo` to have been preserved even after focusing a different program window.
1. run `:set spelllang=sr@latin spell` 2. vim enables spellcheck for serbian latin
well, i admit that the _correct_ behavior of such a menu is not obvious (which window should be closed?
), but certainly, crashing (and actually spinning at 100% cpu until killed on macos) is not expected.
i suspect the correct (intuitive behavior) is to close the window in which the winbar exists.
or at least just close window that 's current, though we should probably update `:help winbar` to state that commands are executed without changing current window (though looking at code, i don 't think this is true).
the implementation of the tab-local `'cmdheight'` values seems to be incomplete with regards to the offered vimscript api functions: * `:help 'cmdheight'` should clearly signify the scope as _tab-local_; the _global (but ...)_ is confusing.
* `gettabvar()` should take `&optionname` varname(s) and allow to query (so far only) tab-local option.
* `gettabwinvar()` should allow to query `&cmdheight` value for an existing window in another tab page, instead of returning (wrong) value for current tab page.
exit alternate screen when recieve sigtstp send with kill
the "focus" not to flicker as shown above.
the balloon to remain on screen until the mouse is moved, per the reported gvim behavior.
the use of `feedkeys` with `<cursorhold>` to work reliably regardless of environment.
no message on status line.
a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
i input the below string into my vimrc py3 print( 'hello world \')" when i opened vim and delete "py3 import os;import it should work but it does not work sometimes , it show below error fatal python error: initfsencoding: unable to load the file system codec modulenotfounderror: no module named 'encodings '
all terminal tests should be passed.
build succeeds on this platform.
let me know if the build time requirement is changed.
expect `+python3` flag to be set.
`gvim` should detach from the terminal.
the second call to `test` not to be made because of the unhandled exception in the first.
vim shows empyt lines only
the `xvfb-run gvim` command to write a file `test` with the contents `1`.
display the utf-8 character where spaces would be.
there should be no spurious changes in syntax highlighting when visually selecting.
it echoes `[{ 'cmd ': '4 ', 'static ': 0, 'name ': 'foo ', 'kind ': ' ', 'filename ': 'xtest '}]`, like it did before
cursor should go to the signature line of `void qux()`.
cursor should go to the signature line of `void qux()`.

This would be very useful.
Any support will help me quite a lot.
I hope the team considers these issues.
If I have the time this weekend I may try to take some video of it.
And if there are particular benchmarks you'd like me to run, lay it out for me exactly what you'd like me to do and I'll give it a try.

It's just my personal experience.
If someone sends us a PR, I'd be very happy to merge it.
Thanks, special functions are well worth adding, and we'd welcome contributions in this direction.
However, I'm undecided on this.
This would help a lot.
Once we are more able to accept external contributions, improvements like these from the community are welcome!
Hopefully it will be helpful for someone here.
Eager contributors should discuss with us here or on the discussion mailing list to figure out the best way to integrate such a change.
Btw, this is my first time contributing to tensorflow, any guidance or suggestion would be appreciated.
I want to contribute to tensorflow java api , I prefer implement it like python. 
I also would like to contribute.
None yet.
